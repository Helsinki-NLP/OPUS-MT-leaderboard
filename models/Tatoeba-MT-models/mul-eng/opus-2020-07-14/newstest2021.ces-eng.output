Novák helped Trabzonspor in the second place, Trefil and Schkoda
Filip Novák helped the goal in the final round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor for the title of the vice-mister.
His team won 2:1 at the graveyard of Kayserispor and held his third Besiktas.
Lieutenant Milan Skod, after a winter break from Slavia, has already given ten branches for the Risspor, which has been saved, even though under 1:3 on the Fenerbahc hill.
Novák confirmed the excellent productivity of the seventh floor in this league anniversary.
In 63 minutes, the goldman Kayserispor just fired a smart shot and the Czech footballist from the ground burned the sword into the net.
At home it took five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor set a win shot on his side in six minutes when he successfully completed four-on-one break.
The damage during the second phase of the run-up with Fenerbache was equal to 1:1.
The challenge of the network did not stand out for a long time, but it did not hold him back because the results of the rivals remained three points above the composite sand.
The competitor ends the Sunday Duel of the Master of the Basaksehir at the Camp of Kasimps.
The well-dressed Jeský in the woods in the New Bor was not actually civilized
On the north of Čech in the south of the Lužic Mountains, near the New Borough of Českolopsk, in the forests that led the Hrabjjjý street, there are a number of scissors.
Natural and art created.
And we come out with the human hand created.
The place is called Jeskine in the desert.
In fact, there was never a deserter here, but he never lived and served as a hiding place, more precisely a hidden room on the plain.
It is drawn from the side to the scalable and accessible from the shells.
But it's not practical to see it in the last minute.
It is exposed to hard layers leading to a sort of rock gallery, from where it first enters the rock.
Even though it seems that the chamber is very far from the human bones, it could be on the top floor, where the forest is today, the field.
"The fact that the object has no window and even a traditional site, it simply proves that no deserter here could ever survive winter," explains historian Kamil Podružek from the Philosophy Faculty of Jan Evangelist Purkyn in Austria over Labe.
A single-space object has just a stone hole that serves obviously to disintegrate the roof.
"I see it as a room to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There's a wall on the walls, and there's a wall on the tools.
The release of the pen with the pen was made very simple and fast.
It was enough to use the sand and the sander gradually to wash away.
According to the length of the step after the syringe and even the method of cutting can be defined as a framework period of drying.
According to history, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
Although it is available freely and according to the injustice in which it appears, there is a time when someone is sleeping in it today.
If you are approaching the corner of the corner from one of the forest roads and we take you under the current direction and the narrow narrow road, you will find the bottom line as well.
And the way out of the forest requires you to still catch some distant Havran rock.
Zkoj Minarík is after a heavy fall in Germany in an artificial bed
"The Philip is now in the best hands.
The Institute is set up on similar occasions, and we have a happy family in Hanover.
This clearly eases my situation and also takes care of the daughter of Finju," the server Jezdci.cz quoted the statement of Minarík's wife Katji.
"Everyone's doing the maximum, Philip now needs time for reconvalence.
It doesn't make sense to give any prognosis.
Anyone who has ever met with a headache and patients in an artificial sleep problem knows that the situation can change.
Filip is a great warrior.
Now we all have to be patient and give him time," said the woman of a five-year-old jockey.
To the financial support of the wounded Minarík, he called on the Twitter and star Frankie Dettori, who won the Royal George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stackes on Saturday in Ascotto, which created the legend of Lester Piggott.
On the Gofundme server today, about 70 thousand euros were selected.
The goal is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million kroner).
The video player took photos of Sassula four goals, played 0:2
Photos of Sassual Networks in the Saturday season in Naples received four-fold sword to the opposite branch, but finally they had to deal with the 0:2 strike.
Not one of their heads decided after consultation with the video because of the abuse.
According to the Italian media, the record of technology has not yet passed so many principles to one team.
"VAR was closer to Sassolo than the railway radar and persecuted him as yet no team.
New technology produces records," wrote Gazzetta dello Sport in a commentary.
"Festival of the undisclosed heads of Sassula.
The VAR has never been so close to one team," added a letter from Corriere dello Sport.
Naapol took the lead in Saturday in 8 minutes, after half an hour of the game, but it seemed that Sassolo did the same.
Mr. Philip Djuricče, however, was not known for his excessive use of videoconferencing.
For the same reason, they did not progressively pay for any of the French Caputa and Domenica Berardi.
On the contrary, the household added one more head.
Electromobiles are calling for a new record.
In Czech, they got the most in history
"The growth took about 30 per cent of the increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent procurement at public stations, as well as rapid development of the registration of new e-uts," said the chief of the company of clean technologies ČEZ Tomáš Chmélik.
Its market share is also reported by other large players, such as PRE and E.ON, manufacturers of Tesla electric cars, but also needs Bill and Lidl's supermarkets.
Operators of classical swine fever stations are also represented by the company MOL.
But there's still no number.
"We started building our electricity network for the first time," explained language company Jan Jusková.
However, the Danish edition exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stations operated by the Czech company.
It turns out that the trainers from the station gathered at 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the noise flow of 100 kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we mention a little sludge to 1 kWh, it takes an average sacrifice of two and a half hours.
Then most of the tankers went free of charge.
If the pick-up engines were already paid, their typical cuts were moving around 330 kroner.
Electromobiles will be dropped primarily in the main city.
On Prague's territory there are all five of the highest profits of the Czech company, which represents its popularity as well as the whole of the country's cities.
Between the regions, the Olomouc is seen.
On the other hand, the least interest is in a remote station in the border, such as in Bohumin or Prachati, which is often left out all day without use.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in Czech Republic.
Only in the first half of the year, 1274 new e-cars arrived.
In the extensive Deník survey, "Cheši in motion" indicated eight percent of readers that the purchase of an electric car is considered to be family.
However, only a third of the respondents know where to find the nearest shopping station in their area.
Not just to keep water better.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to the organizers, the government's sufficient steps to protect and heal the Czech Republic and resolve the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for a more diverse approach.
Actions called the Last Capca were attended by representatives of large organisations such as the Huntia Duha, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local communities.
"We have here, for example, people who are long-term anti-tourismists, there are people who stand up against the pressures of the Uherish Ostros, there are people who stand up against the construction of meaningless buildings," said Marika Volfová's organizers.
It noted that the main requirements of the protestors are the creation of a water conservation plan in the country, the different changes in agricultural policy and a system for supporting sustainable agriculture, and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government has to suppress the interests of people, not blind and boring business," she said.
A petitioning representative of the Czech State was placed in the Malostrans site to establish a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of the Czech soil and territory.
Neighbors were equipped with transparencys with words such as "Finishings of fish" or "Millows, more people".
From south Moravia to Prague, Jan Skod came from the Water for People who protested against the plan of the Black Crowd in Hodoninsk.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140 000 people," he said.
He added that the gardens represent the fifth most significant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned weight of the chassis is only about 500 metres from the garden, and according to estimates it is certain that the quality of water will be threatened.
For the so-called agricultural farm, Valeč came from the village of Karlovarsk Vojtèch Veselý.
He warned of the fate of small farmers who are not paid for their profits and profits and who attack the inhabitants directly at the site.
"The small agroecological plants are able to feed the whole population perfectly, while the designs do not make such a threat to the environment and the environment," he said.
Three people died on the plane at home in Germany
At the end of the ultrasound plane on the house in western Germany, three people died and two others were injured.
Local rescue records were reported, according to which there are probably two members of the deceased and one resident of the house.
The airport was on the roof of the building in Wesel, in the northeastern part of Westphalia.
The underground apartment, which was one of the five housing units in the house, then started to fire.
The Hasichs have already managed to get the flames under control.
The representative of the local prosecutors Robert Mayboom reported that both of the members of the flight were apparently dead.
The third victim is by the police of a woman who lived in the house.
Deník Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote that it was the mother of a suicide victim whose two-year-old daughter was saved from living with slight injuries.
In the near future, an emergency case was found, which apparently served as an emergency at the time of accession.
The police are coming out of a bombed plane.
There was a place for two people at the airport.
The storm started off the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
Daník Rheinische Post, with a call for clear witnesses, pointed out that the aircraft was hit by a hot air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, with a call from other witnesses, wrote that the plane crashed into the air before the crash.

"Also yesterday (in Saturday) we carried out an update of the system and all these double payments were immediately returned to customers.
At this moment everything works without problems," he said on Sunday afternoon in Cropik.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank counted money from the charity payments twice did not know the bank's talking, according to its estimate, was less than a thousand transactions.
The cause of the problems is found in the company.
"It could have been a combination of more factors," said Cropik.

At the end of the month, they had 4.6 million.
The owner is the Russian Financial Group of the Erste Group Bank, which is the key player in the central and eastern European banking market.
Voyettes in the afternoon will present a three-phase system against Coronavir
"They will gradually be based on the strength of community enlargement at the regional level.
We are working on it together with epidemiology and the Institute of Medical Information and Statistics," Vojtéch said in ČT.
As regards semafor, individual regions will be marked by green, orange or red color at risk of coronavir exposure.
The Minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about listing individual countries.
He agreed that the orange color would now only have the Moravskoslez region and be close to Praha.
The map will also include individual measures for national health stations, hospitals, social facilities and employees.
"We want to solve this at the regional level because the situation in them is not unique," said the Voytés.
A guide and Karolinka
When they're waiting for Captain Jonah and the millennial daughter of Caroline, they don't even have a simple one.
Jonah's love is protecting his father, the infamous leader of Hastrbuch, and Karolinka has no emotion that her beloved Jonah is not a man.
And yet there is young Libor, who will do everything in order to protect all, especially Carolynk, before that waterfall.
What about being involved and lying?
Especially when he finds out that Caroline Jonas's turn down and gave him the privilege he gave to Libor.
In the meantime, it is clear to everyone who is able to fire the night Convicky, shown by the mouse, the fire of the millennia and other lottery.
The differences in the village are arranged on the waterways, and still on Jonah’s head will be an incalculable water tank.
And now Convict's soul, Caroline's soul!
How can you persuade the old Hasrbucha, convince the neighbors of Jonah’s guilt, find Jonah and release him from prison?
The event was held in September 2010 in ČT studies and abroad in Bržina fishermen, in Sedlčančansk and in a beautiful historical environment in Hoslovic.

The experience of most disabled people is peaceful, only three percent of those in the hospital must be trained
Either the Czechs spread the calmer form of coronavir, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved immunity.
Infectious divisions of patients are progressive, even though the number of reported growths has increased.
"This situation today and in depth is completely different and it is given primarily by a number of hospitalised people," confirmed the Minister of Health Adam Vojtès.
It is worth noting that on 11 April, when the first wave of epidemics hit us, all Russians, the military committees, the republics were closed and Czechs were in need of disinfection for the previous year.
Still, ten people died every day.
Now the daily growth of the number of students is higher, but every day with covid-19 dies at least two people.
The highest number of citizens in the population still has Karvinsko, the same number already has Jihlav because of the fire in the local Alzheimer's, where 57 are already trained - 40 customers and 17 employees.
Other homes for the elderly were closed up in the Chernožícias at King's Palace.
The disease confirmed tests in one of the nurses.
"We're looking, we've mixed movement, we've got all the hygienic measures," says the landlord of Martin Schánil.
According to him, none of the clients at home yet have symptoms of illness.
The regular tests shall start early in the morning and then decide on further measures.
The increased number of infected patients also respond.
The oncological institution in Brno today sent an automatic camera system into the entrance which is known to have people at the entrance of the found hole.
The record refers to South-South hygienics who recorded five cases of Coronavir - most of them made foreign employees of the Prachatic firm.
A total of 131 students came on Saturday - so half of the Friday number - on the weekend, but it's less tested.
Debuting champion!
Van den Bergh wrote my post, Anderson smetl
The great surprise of the tournament in the name of Dimitri van den Bergh presented an excellent performance and in the game with the player who won the second most prestigious PDC company in 2018.
The introduction of the package was largely balanced, evil came for 8:7 for the Belgian chipper.
Van den Bergh took a break with 13 chips, and he's been planning since then.
His opponent had his own game of experience and the most well-tested "Flying Scot" was only hard to get to adults.
The way she had the "Simple of Dreams" in her throat, testifies to the fact that the divorced Anderson played his first maximum until the 24th of November.
In addition, young Belgiuman managed a great deal of control.
Last he lost in a one-legged league, for a non-responsible condition, but "he caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the session, Anderson saw a huge frustration.
The chips were just in the mood, and his triumphem running against him became quite subversive.
Van den Bergh immediately changed the first of the three cards and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The triumph of the trophies, named after Phil Taylor, is more valuable to the Belgian chipper than to his first winner.
And he continues to pay so that the last player who managed to win out of Bergha is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes there was a charge of fire for the cathedral, the man admitted
The cathedral of the Holy Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn the past Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original windows of the 16th century and destroyed the walls.
In view of the jealousy of the investigators, the fires made the temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police didn't find any signs of anyone getting violent in the cathedral.
He's accused of being a volunteer in a local diocese, a nine-year-old gangbanger.
The police arrested him a short time after the fire, but then they let him go without a criminal attack.
Now the prosecutor reported that on the basis of new evidence, the man was again arrested on Saturday, admitted and accused of hunger.
In case he's been chased by a thief, he's been under ten years of imprisonment and a high trial.
According to his lawyer, his husband regrets and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Voyeurs: In the afternoon we will present "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is to play a role in the pandemic, because of its absence from government and the ministry of health criticism.
"They will gradually be by the power of community expansion," the minister explained.
He added, for example, that in the meantime the Morakskoslez region or Prague would reach the average orange level.
The system is designed as a regional one because the situation in individual countries is significantly improved.
The Ministry worked with epidemiology and the Institute for Medical Information and Statistics (UZIS).
At a certain level, specific measures will be imposed by the Minister, whether it is the obligation to carry rice or to organise special services in hospitals.
To create an epidemiological plan in the Prima Partie TV series, Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for clear information on what measures can be expected if the epidemiological situation deteriorates.
The daily growth of confirmed cases in Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalised remains low.
Voyers commented that there is no major incident to be talked about the declaration of the state of emergency or the revote of the state of crisis.
In view of the growing number of students from Saturdays throughout the Czech Republic, the government has again assumed the responsibility of carrying Russians on internal affairs over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited to 500 people, now it's 1,000 people.
The government's procedure, when it was not clear to the last minute, what measures and when they started to pay, even when they were announced, was expected to be criticised.
"I think that in a situation that is moderately tense, the main factors should create a sense of security instead of comparing the damage," Senator Marek Hilscher said in Questions.
The measures can now be broken down according to the region, such as in Prague since Monday, the duty to carry rice and in non-resident medical devices, for example in medicines or in waiters in doctors.
The obligation to carry rice on a visit to medical and social facilities or doctors has also been imposed by the fleet in Liberia and Austria.
There is a need to wear roses in internal public spaces, in MHD and in medical facilities since 14 June.
On the contrary, anti-piedemic measures were released in the country of Morazkosleslez, just like in the Central region of Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government has also adopted a so-called summit for Europe, which, in a colourless manner, distinguishes the risk of harm in certain European countries, and thus regulates rules applicable to entry into Czech countries.
In a country with a low and medium risk of the authorities from 15 June, they do not require a negative test on or instead of a quarantine from the Czech citizens.
They are responsible for the return of Czechs from the country with high risk.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in low-risk categories.

The police also solved 14 infringements in the right way.
At the request of the participants, the police have carried out 300 preventive tyre tests and four preventive tests for the presence of self-containing and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people on the scene this morning.
If the number of participants had not been reduced, the police would have been there.
In the TV series Prima Partie said it was Minister in Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
However, the number of participants decreased by 1000, the police assessed that the measure was unnecessary and did not require a health station or the Ministry of Health.
The Czech TV (CT) indicated on Sunday that the technology party also expanded to the surrounding areas whose owners did not agree with the use of the technology party.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding lands will demand compensation for damages.
Techniques at Hlaváčkka Lhoty arrived on Friday night.

According to Novak, no one came to Blažia.
Bleeding of snakes: Holchička has ended up in the hospital!
"The first annual case was recorded in Železnorudsk.
A change in the girl's leg, the year 2010, which her parents brought to the bottom of the secret rescue service," Daník told the national language health care services Maria Freebodva that children were then transferred to the hospital in Klatoves.
The snake is the only living hade in the Czech Republic and right on the island of Sumavi these animals are released in a higher number, so it is good to take care of them in the passageways.
However, no great danger exists from these animals.
The chance that you'll be relieved is not too high, when they're in regular contact, they're afraid of themselves.
And if there's room for it, he's happy he's gone.
Only if you feel a lot threatened - for example if you apologize to her.
Even her frustration isn't a tragedy, her diet is quite effective against little counselers, but people don't die.
This can happen only when a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers allergic reactions.
The risk of danger is, therefore, especially in children, seniors and allergic reactions.
"A man often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, fever, chest pain and swelling, in weakened units and especially allergic reactions, may come to an anaphylactic shock," she wrote for Deník Miriam Gredová from the Klatovska hospital.
The man threatened to get out of the window.
After the police, the wine and the wine will be restored

The prisoners immediately took care of health care, introduced a press report by the national police, Markéta Janovská.
The man didn't want to cooperate with the police, after the police escorting him to a shelter, his knife, or he took her out of the window.
Several times during the surgery, he calmed down with the child in his arms and pulled out of the window.
I even went out to the window's entrance, where he came back.
The police are still investigating the man.
He still doesn't want to publish any more information.

Sapa Market: Razia has removed the meat, fish and eggs of an unknown origin
"One of the vehicles traveling to the area transported 1320 kussies of the unknown origin, except under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the assailant undertaking," the National Veterinary Administration said.
The inspection of the stock with live fish showed that the seller had no evidence of the origin of the product and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered long-term because of the issue of veterinary supervision.
For example, on the ground in which the veterinarians produced illegal food, it contained about half the tonnes of unlabelled food without evidence of origin.
In most cases, the date of consumption was not found, some of the products were long-lasting and were shown.
In five kilograms, the duration was exceeded by three years.
In May, farmers with police officers in the area of the market held 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, except for dried fish, olives or frozen cats, which were part of the dance.
Putin telephoned Zelenski before starting directly in Donbas, Kreml criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he has to start paying a new rent from midnight.
Putin, according to Kremlu's statement, criticized the Ukrainian Parliament's decision on the conduct of local elections; Kyev informed her that Zelenski called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new peace of arms was agreed by Ukraine and Russia on Wednesday evenings to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
It is appropriate to start after midnight on Monday, be "complete and universal" and open the way to the fulfilment of other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin, in his speech to Zelenska, said that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to organise local elections contradicts the peace agreement from Minsk and threatens the prospects for a conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the elected elections to local representatives would not be effective on the territory of the Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kyev will regain control of the Ukrainian separatists' acquisitions with Russia after providing wide autonomy to these regions and arranges local elections here.
According to the Union Agency, the Green Office indicated that the two states agreed on the progress of the progress which would take place in Donbas and on the need to take further measures to support peace in this region, such as the abolition of the war zone or the withdrawal of part of the border unit.
Zelenski also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia alone.
However, the Minsk Agreement has helped to stop wars, in times of shootings and partial attacks on both sides, people still die.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 dead since January 2014.
Ukraine and the West blame Russia for the military support of the separatists, which Moscow condemns.
Zelenskyj made his priority at the end of the war in Donbas, but it has not yet been achieved.
The unexpected master in the tenth is Rykl, the seventh ruler of Novotna
The winner of the last two titles was unable to reach the end of the fourth-century Saturday program, Kopecký didn't break the foundation on Sunday.
Ten years later, the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for the team of the poet Joseph Karase, left after the disc.
He had two bronze medals from the external MPR, this time being the only ten-year-old who got across the semantic border.
Other medals followed him by Villem Strásky and Petr Urban.
After the competition, the Reek recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sykory.
"I'm sorry that there were no keys here and Kope didn't put it because it would look completely different.
But the title is very good, I appreciate it, especially because I gave myself a 30 centimeter in the distance.
Then I was still happy with the bottle and most of all, I was about to lose my disk, and there I was underweight," he admitted to a Swiss facebook.
On the first day of the week, she won more than a football match for Katerina Cacho, although she was hit by a broken knife on her back.
However, in the distant sector, only 570 cm was written, the stone did not pass 40 metres, and it did not reach the final oscillator.
Novotna collected 5878 points and won 241 points before Caterín Dvorák.
She came out first, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630s.
Yesterday I started to cry a little bit, but I am very glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't even limit me," said Novotna on a funny facebook.
The Czech Republic was affected by LPG, promises organic transport
Liquefied Petroleum Gas is a very well-known alternative fuel in Czech.
In particular, it is preferred to lower the price for the sale of gasoline or oil, to provide a significantly lower consumption, and its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like gasoline and oil, he also has his ecological quick version -- "Bio LPG".
But this is all the news - first appeared on the European market and in Czech, according to a press report, the Czech Association LPG arrived a few days ago.
"In these days we have received the first fifteen tonnes of LPG, which will be distributed in combination with the classic fossil LPG at our railway station," says Jiri Karlíka from Primagas.
Bio LPG must not be treated as bioethanol or bionophthalate.
According to the association, the chemical page is consistent with the classic red LPG, which now connects a number of motorists into their cars.
That's why it's also possible for both versions to be voluntarily moved.
"The only difference in sales to classical LPG is the way of production," says LPG Ivan Indraček, president of the association.
It is also said that one of the great benefits of LPG was to sell to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and maintain, as well as distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared with water or electricity.
Currently, this fluid is obtained as a further product in the production of bioethanol from the residues of food and sugar.
In the future, it should also be made with a target, e.g. cell biomass, then with a wood waste.
On the contrary, the classic red LPG appears partly as a subsequent product in the refining of rice, partly separated by the weight of the ground oil.
Therefore, depending on the technology of production and the source of the vehicle to bio LPG of 40-70% ecologically faster from the perspective of carbon footprints than from the production of crude LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the emissions of cars, it is also about the environment of fuel production, i.e. the part "well-to-tank" (Czech "source to container").
One of the largest producers was LPG currently belonging to the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol has examined the possibility of production and company Unipetrol in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the estimates of the association in Czech countries, some 170 000 vehicles are driving on LPG; the Ministry of Environment reports in the NAP ČM on a slightly higher number, a total of 200 thousand.
According to the Ministry of Transport statistics, only about 6 000 stops were carried out in the last year.
In Czech, LPG is possible at a range of 950 stations of different operators.
Voyettes reviewed the number of reported cases, number of 1775 cases
The Minister of Health Adam Vojtès (for the UN) ordered the ministry to review the numbers assigned to the Coronavir Office.
New statistics were published in the Sunday Ministry of Health on its website.

Politologists and sociologists sought options for the duration of pandemics
In order to be able to vote in the regular national and senate elections for the Coronavir quarantine, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Jan Hamáčka (ČSSD), should change the law.
Parliament could sell it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He put it on Sunday at Prima TV.
On Tuesday, he wishes to take a possible decision with the representatives of the parliamentarians.
"To do anything, it will have to mean a change of the law of free will," Hamaček said.
The Senate called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the legal rules.
The Minister pointed out, however, that the provisions of the law should be amended, so that people in quarantine cannot vote because of their health status.
The prohibition of choice should be maintained, for example, in patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop in the list of OVM indicated that the possibility of correspondence will already be withdrawn since 2004.
And the current proposal of the law, which is in the shadow, will be counted by its introduction to vote abroad, but not in Czech.
At the same time, the Prokop considers the concerns of the ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, this would be better illustrated by other types of parties) from the corresponding choice for the latter.
It is, in person, against the possibility of electronic vote, where the possibility of abuse is important.
Michal Klíma said that now there is ad hoc need to think about mechanisms (voebs) that could be implemented this year and with the least health risk.
It is therefore considered to be prepared for the year 2021 when parliamentary elections are held in Czech Republic.
Correspondence will be considered as one of the functional methods.
As elsewhere, the above-mentioned electoral unit may see the possibility of a step-by-step vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how a similar situation - elections during the Coronavir period - resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
As a result of the expansion of coronavir vaccines, various types of polls have already been suspended in 67 countries of the world.
Protests in Buharsko: The ears of the deaf have shown on government building
The participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Boris and his cabinet found themselves on the construction of the government's ears.
Another of the series of protests against the "Mafian style of government", which have been held in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers plan on the middle of the national blockade, introduced the DPA agency.
Today's protest that has already taken place 18 days later, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom has a lower participation than before.
At 20:00 a crowd of 300 gathered, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators in front of the building of the government held a grand scene, where symbolicly closed the prison cell of Prime Minister Boris and Attorney General Ivan Gesev in connection with the arrest of two presidents, Romanian Radeva, who is a strong political opposition to the government.
Retirement is based on the basic requirements of the protestors.
They also called for a reduction in reported health reforms and the end of corruption in the construction of the Black Sea border.
Today's protest organizer Nikolay Hadjigen pointed out in a public resolution that the "highest escalation" is on the average, like "the national demonstration in Sofia and the blockade in the whole country".
He filled out a demand for the resignation of Boris and his government, as well as for the withdrawal of previous elections.
Those good things should be done in March 2021.
Borisov's already told me that he's not allowed to leave.
This has given rise to the need to carry out the Bulgarian pandemic of 19 Cavidu and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he exchanged five members of his government team so that they would not be affected by the demonstrations.
At the beginning of this week, the government of Borisov remained in Parliament voting for trust in Parliament.
Trainer Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants no fun without the monsters
The football coach Boloni Sinisha Mihajlovic already has a lot of games in the Italian League without any dragons.
The Serbian poet hopes that from the new season the fans will return to the stadium.
"What we're doing here right now is not a football.
I've got a full teeth of fun without monsters.
It's a free football, it won't give me any emotion, no joy.
Those tapes are worse than a coach.
Play like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks it," Mihajlovic introduced today's against Lecce.
After the coronavir break, the series A tracks are followed quickly, and although they are played by evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible weather.
Under such conditions, they don't even know what the team is on.
It's time for this season to end.
These measures had to be agreed to kill the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from Saturday," said a guard who in the past led Fiorentina or AC Milan.
For Mihajlovic, this season is unusual, and because four months on the street were missing because of leukemia.
"Despite my weakness, the breach of the law, and all the others, our team was led to a high level.
We want further growth and we need to make players mentally stronger," he said.
We've become a cybersex in foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear devices have been reported to fire and explosions, electricity, factories and businesses.
Some Iranians pointed out that the fire that took place this month in the underground nuclear power plant in Natanzu could cause cybernetic damage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not been explained yet.
A spokesman from the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abbas Musavi, told Iranian media journalists that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure is headed by "twissed cybernetic attacks" every day.
He added that it's not about a new Jew and that most of them can be dismissed.
In recent months, several more cybernetic attacks have been recorded according to Musavy, which have been analysed by the "extreme governments and groups".
However, he did not share any more details about possible friends, according to Reuters.
The museum also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in summer.
A member of the Iranian state agency IRNA announced this month that enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the United States, could be affected by recent incidents.
Not one of these countries, but not one of the specific attacks referred to in Article, has been charged directly.
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic ties shortly after the revolution in 1979, while Iranian military students were detained on American embassy in Tehran and held for 444 days as the hands of 52 Americans.
The long-term relationship between the two countries increased in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions against Iran that had a serious impact on its economy.
Another significant scalding came this year after the American army killed the Iranian General Kásema Solyméné and leader of the Iraqi militia Abū Mahdí Muhanese on January 3rd.
Then, on January 8th, Iran set fire to the basics in Iraq, where the US is moving, the number of rockets.
The U.S. until they left, they admitted that dozens of American soldiers had been wounded.
Israel considers Iran as its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu is the main advocate of the international nuclear agreement with Iran since 2015.
According to Israel's prime minister, Iran is trying to produce an atomic bomb, which Iran smokes.
The TPCA vehicle extended the distance of the product, now until 25 May
The Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended the withdrawal of the production due to coronavir.
The production lines should be reopened on Monday, 25 May.
He's carrying out dozens of hygienic measures, says the talk car Tomáš Paroubek.
The product is due to coronavir pandemics since 18 March.
The company originally intended to restore it on Monday 18 May.
Due to the extension of the discounts, according to Paroubka, the border is closed and the duty is closed, the car is not sold as well.
According to Paroubka, the company will be made up of 100 per cent from the start, so to two changes.
Coronavir is affected by the key markets of companies, such as Italy, Great Britain or Spain.
Old Michael Kashpar (Module for Kolin) said that the absence of production in TPCA does not describe life in the city.
"From the beginning it was known that the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filled, especially now from Monday when it's been quite relaxed.
So the city is full," Kašpar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed on the residents.
"For the two months we didn't want to solve almost any problem," Kašpar said.
For example, the young people's Schkoda Auto, who also stopped production due to the Coronavir crisis, resumed it on Monday 27 April in all three of its production campaigns in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the competitions works at 100% capacity.
The restoration of the product in Scotland has provided more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday afternoon, the young Boleslav and Kvasiná were first released after the re-production of the product, then the night shift.
At the present time, there are 2500 people working in the TPCA and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time employees in Kolinsk.
The cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: Leaving the family report
For more than two years she struggled with Gemma Sisson's recent cancer, and when it seemed that cancer had broken down, the disease came back.
A nine - year - old woman who loved culture eventually ended up in bed in a guesthouse where she was still able to take her life.
I mean, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
A few hours after his death on her social network account, facebook published a shocking report for those closest.
Gemma Sisson, from England's Leeds, loved culture.
With a friend of Ricky Moore, who lived with him for more than 16 years, they traveled all over the world after the competitions.
Nineteen-year-old woman was sports and lived healthy, although she was diagnosed with cancer in the autumn of 2018.
Gemma has begun to develop an eating disorder, radiotherapy, in hopes of getting better.
After months of treatment, Gemmé actually seemed to have been overcrowded with cancer, and in August 2019 cancer returned and this time hit the father.
A cultureist and personal coach according to information from British poet Daily Mirror undertook a ten-year-old patrol operation and then started with a drastic treatment.
All of this was shit.
At the beginning of this year, at her ninth birthday, her doctors informed her that she had been alive for a few months.
Finally, in the depth of her mind, she decided to go to a hospital in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding with her dear Rick.
Marriage lasted two months.
Ricky recently took Gemma on their two-month anniversary to the restaurant.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
A few hours after her death, her social network account revealed the contribution that Gema wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Even if I have a broken heart that I leave my loved ones here, I'm so happy to be free of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough for my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network with the fact that pain and suffering finally arose and she found relief.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, saying that everyone should respect his life and live it fully.

Images and other shapes are made directly for the art, so they know they have to fit into size 8.5 to 5.5 centimetres.
Every place is numbered and signed.
"In the bathroom there is always a curator's text about the artist and then the work itself," said the curator of the Petra Vidjová project.
Artam works with the principle of fate.
The buyer may then be surprised at what artistic work he gets.
At present, it may be necessary to become the new master of the fantastic illustration of Alexandri Stopole or mini-views from Terezy Bonaventur, who may even send it.

Payments in the next year's health will increase by up to five per cent.
More growth is unrealistic according to Vojtècha
Health payments could increase by more than five per cent in the coming year, the Minister for Health Adam Vojtès (for the UN) said in Questions Václava Moravce in Czech TV.
The demand for an increase of up to 15 per cent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-employed in ensuring protection assistance.
He says the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think growth can be up to five percent," said the minister.
According to him, the current situation should be reflected when from March she was involved in the selection of a secure pandemic of Coronavir and the government regulation against its spread.
Let's get insurance at that time.
"By 15 percent, I'm going to be raised at this moment unrealistic," said the Voytés.
The average monthly doctorate in acute leukemia according to the data Set up for medical information and statistics (UZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 kroner a year, sister 47 498 kroner.
The difference between the sister's salary in the state hospitals and the fact that other caregivers will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The UZIS data also shows that he stopped the deaths of healthy sisters in hospitals.
In 2019 the average number in Czech Republic was 34 125 kroner, according to the Czech statistical authority.
In June, the representatives of the committee indicated that they would require a minimum increase of 10 per cent, ideally 15 per cent for the year 2021.
They criticise a long-term difference between the medical profession and the nurse in national hospitals, which must be managed in flat tables, and the contractual possibilities in hospitals, countries or individuals.
They therefore also require that the plates be uniform for doctors.
In the health nurse's year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand kroner a month.
For example, doctors may have grown faster than wages.
According to the President of Czech Stomatological Chambers Romana Shmuclera, the councils should consider how they are currently in the state.
In recent years, due to the effects of the epidemic of covid, the increase in the annual government budget of 500 billion kroner, of which 1.75 billion is to be paid to doctors in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Providers of Health Care according to Shmuclera does not agree with the overall increase in payments in the coming year.
According to him, the award should be decided on by the hospital itself and by the medical device and the money should also be transferred through the award notice.
Voyettes also indicated that the hospitals currently have plenty of protective assistance.
The President of the National Mass Reserves Board (SSHR) Paul Svagr said this week that the administration has no existing health assistance in the estate.
He's waiting for the election order to be completed.
According to Vojtècha, suppliers in the world are now able to supply goods better than in the winter when they were bought.
The State should try to be the most self-sustainable and buy from the Czech companies, according to him.
I mean, we could take the soldiers out of the carantane.
We're ready, they say.
"Cythra quarantine works, it's to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss with the army tonight.
The army is perfectly functioning and it's a question whether they shouldn't manage it any more," the president of the government introduced the government on Sunday in his Facebook order of Chau people.
According to it, IT systems and hygienic stations cannot be sufficiently proposed, which must gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were according to the Prime Minister in the Republic of Morazkosles, where they are one of the current epidemics.
The Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek for ČTK indicated that there is no information on Sunday meetings and that the government should be involved in the afternoon.
The army is now ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project took over the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
By that time, the quarantine was captured by a 19th-century central commander of the military team as the government’s advisory body, which led the former ministers of Roman Primula.
On Sunday, the draft was criticised by Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
And he insisted that he could be reimbursed by the army.
The shortcomings in the project have also been attributed to the government's IT and digitalized Vladimír Dzurilla, who cares for him.
"The system works, but it's still working on it.
It's been a self-containing and non-systemic 20 years, we've been trying to sit down for a couple of months.
It's not a trick.
The people on the way, the poor on the hygiene on the way, adapt these new systems and actually get rid of the mistakes," he said.
The Austrian Prime Minister Macura won't apply again, he doesn't want to be "politically involved"
The current island Prime Minister Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not be candidate in the next municipal elections.
For this reason the effort is "not to get involved in politics," said the server Respectt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the UN Presidency, is the recipient of the Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, he received a leading candidate for the UN strike in Ostrava about a third of the votes in favour.
Macura originally wanted to be in function for only four years.
"I said I'd hold one working period, and with this business experience, I'd be able to translate everything and put it on my feet for a while," said Respect.
He added that for the second time, he was allowed to talk to a certain extent.
"But for me it's the maximum.
I don't want to get involved in this politics," added Macura, who, in his speech, identified himself as a difficult introvert, who does not engage in honorable contact with people.
According to Respect, more time is being spent on Macuro's possible end in the UN.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticised the ANO node, for example for connections with the SPD node or for support of Miloše Geman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few properties of the ANOs, he supported the Earth's protagonist of Jiří Drahoše.
From the UN strike that entered in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"Even if I feel that I can change something in my stomach that it's not a whole fucking war and that no one's coffee for it, I don't have a direct reason to end it," said Respect.
Sixteen-year-old Macura studied at the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming an Austrian recipient in 2014, Macura acted separately as director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He's also sitting in other offices.
To Brna, Uber offers transport services
Up to the end of July, Uber will return to the company offering transport services.
This is the consequence of the amendment of the Act, which was introduced in the press release of the Working Brna for the transport of Peter Kratochvil (ODS) on Thursday.
Anti-Uberu in Brno protested taxis, indicating that Uber does not comply with conditions such as markings as taxis or taximeters.
However, the amendment of the Act has changed the conditions for carrying out regular taxis and those alternatives since July.
In the last few weeks, he has completed several meetings with Uber's representatives.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brna by the end of July of the year.
This step is the result of amendments to the law which enables this company to carry out its activities legally.
The city was marked by this change and we believe that the company will carry out its services within these limits," Kratochvil said.
The murder took place in Brno in the past.
He was challenged by taxi drivers because of not identifying vehicles as taxis or missing taxis.
The Court issued a preliminary measure prohibiting Uber in the city.
Brno initially supported the taxi driver, but late last year, the Prime Minister Markéta Vanuková (ODS) indicated that the city would want to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could run in Brno, but the company did not use it.
Now it's coming back on the basis of changes in the law.
From July, it is estimated that according to classic taxis, light and taximeter, transport services can be carried out more easily by ordering and charging exclusively through mobile applications.

Request for a call from Rafaje to try Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to make a request to the Head of the Anti-Monopolian Authority (UOHS) Petra Rafaje on Monday with the coalitional social democracy.
In response to Rafaje's call, non-profit organizations called on the government's anti-corruption council as well as the Ustek Country.
Social Democrats claim that the change in office is on the ground.
According to information from ČTK Rafaj, the government was not invited on Monday.
The second term ends in the second half of the next year, under the law it cannot be named.
His call is in the competences of President Milos Zeman.
In response to the challenge of non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar requirement from Austria.
That's why they should be outside the Rafa's lately.
In the past week, the Prime Minister refused to make a request by saying that he was familiar with the material and that the government's "some opinion".
He also pointed out that he had not yet met with the president, he had no meeting with him at the earliest time.
According to the Commission's statement of appeal, there is no reason why Rafaj was not charged with anything.
servers IHNED.cz and Currently.cz wrote in the last week that the police were interested in the Rafa's meeting with the Hetman Jiři Čunek.
In addition to the decision to compete on the project, the new anti-competitive hospital for eight billion people, which is severely affected by Chunek, has given rise to meetings.
The shadow of the meeting acknowledged, according to him, that his "sensitivity" was solved jointly.
He's talking, too, Rafa.
The representative of the Ustec region called on the government at the end of June.
It also calls for the reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Authority.
The decision of the EAGGF on public contracts under the scheme for the transport of Jaroslava Komínka is not transparent and has voluntary marks.
Loni, in the coastal police station, was arrested by an anti-monopol authority because of the tendency to choose a mine.
This year in June, the server Actually.cz warned that Rafaj would enjoy being posted to the company of a influential chess player ČSSD Alexandra Chuby.
The amount of 3.5 million to live in Brno was paid from Rafa's account.
The President of the Authority for the Protection of Economic Competition, Rafaj, of 9 July 2009, appointed the President of the former Social Democracy for the second working period in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafa's second six-year term will come to an end.
The Anti-Monopoulic Authority Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Authority on a proposal from the Government.
It may only be accepted if it does not perform a function for more than six months or seriously violates its function or independence and impartiality of the Authority.

"The sun is also at her door, thanks to the covering of the building, it's covering much of the day.
At the same time, it is a major problem for individual divisions to be dealt with, as the window must be closed at night for safety reasons.
We often have this from the morning in the library to the third level," Dlapa said.
The worst was the studio and the library in the third floor.
And on the floor, there's an exhibition room and an office.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's section, which is under the roof of the building.
"Several times it happened that the librarians worked together and ended up in a job failure.
The problem also arose regularly in cultural rooms at lectures that visit tens of people.
After a few minutes, he couldn't breathe there anymore," said Dlapa.
Initially, the city's representatives wanted to make this year air-conditioning in all the libraries.

Thousands of people protested in Israel against prime ministers
Thousands of Israelis in a number of countries protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu handled the Korean crisis.
Manifestacs were played outside of Netanyahu's private villa in the city of Caesarea, near its official residence or in the park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests are taking place regularly for several weeks.
Their participants call for Netanjahua to be rejected for the process in which it is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as for how the government solves another wave of Coronavir's epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," wrote one of the demonstrators to his transparent agency, referring to Netanjahu's generally known surprise.
"Everyone sees that the Emperor has lost his clothes," stood on the other side.
Seventy-seven-year-old Netanyah is the first prime minister in Israel to perform the function.
He is blamed for three causes of corruption, fraud and mistrust.
All charges are denied and mark them on the witch's side.

After the gradual release of the restrictions from the end of the deep but in particular, the red numbers were beginning to rise dramatically again.

The look on the word fashion, sometimes a persuaded access to clothing, but in recent years it changes relatively quickly.
About half of Peter’s goods were sold at a full price.
The other half that sells because I'm blind, so don't buy it.
The company does not want to cover one collection for another and at the end of each season the products will be reduced under their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner of Michala Michaky, new and old collections and blind follow-up quickly with changing fashion trends.
"Most sellers with discounts are already counted on the purchase of goods, in full price it is so included in much higher markets.
So it's actually a little bit of a doubt," said Peter Filipi Michal Mička.
In addition to its approach, the company wants to support the local business.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality materials and designed by local designers.
We are grateful that a large part of our collection has been created so much as a basis for hair - i.e. clothes that are excessive and excessive.
Globally, it is a segment of the premium signs of the absence of any typical discount, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," Mička adds.
The cover graph represents the RAF Kurta Tausig flight
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our moving pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the second world war.
The proposal for city leadership was popular," Vacek said, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive creation.
He then needed 300 liters of paint and 50 picks.
Kurt Tausig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
As a result of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to the international camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, because of Nicholas Winton's organization, he and his brother managed to escape from the concentration camp.
In 1939, Tassig arrived in Great Britain, where he volunteered to enter the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later conducted a pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined the war operations in early 1945.
Several times after the same revolution, he visited Czech and native Teplice, which made him a proud citizen.
Sixty-three-year-old Kamil Vacek, whose people in the street art industry know about Camo, has been working in the tropical streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the surfaces, which included the more recent Prime Minister Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) for these purposes.
Boure Hanna reached the coast of Texas.
Hurikán Hanna arrived on the south-western coast of the state of Texas on Saturday afternoon (before midnight).
The Texas island of Padre Island, 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, was en route to a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a serious danger to the citizens of the coastal areas.
He also brought with him strong wind and intense waves; along with the local waters are reported electricity and various material damages, including other damaged ships, according to the AP agency.
The Texas government, Greg Abbott, has already declared the state of natural disasters and recommended voluntary evacuation on Saturday for 32 hours in southeastern Texas.
The most powerful warning came from the coastal pass between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay, but he had to cross the territory about 500 miles [500 km] before moving progressively over northeastern Mexico.
"Even though Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, the rise of cold, dangerous weather and a single storm poses a threat," said the United States National Centre for Huricans (NHC).
Today's morning of the local time (on Sunday SELČ) the storm was moving in the US-Mexico border area, providing it with a wind speed of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hannah became the first horrid annual hurrican season in the Atlantic area on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was operated at a speed of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but it gradually dropped to 112 kilometers per hour, which Hanu again ordered from the Ukrainians.
Local authorities called for the storm to wait at home and not forget about the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas belongs to the American states, which the panda of the poor covid-19 is the largest.
In view of the ongoing security measures and the need to comply with the derogations, there are significant and random evacuations.
The provisional facilities were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In the Texas period Hidalgo, one of the buildings was also used as a shelter after evacuated, who had a positive test on the coronavirus or were otherwise subjected to injury.
The local authorities have called for all evacuated to take roaches and disinfectants with them to the grave, if possible.
"We don't even have it far behind us yet.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted AP Chris Birchfield, an agency working for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) service in Brownsville.
It claims that in some places it could extend up to 300 millimetres in a few hours, in some cases it would be less than 500 millimetres, which, together with the freezing of the cold, could cause a series of seats on the coast.
Land of general value of Colonel Lipkov
President Miloš Zeman, in the middle of the general audience of Colonel Paul Lipkov.
This is due to a review of the expected incidents of the Ministry of Defence.
As a result, the value of the Brigadier General is a Serbian approach to Lipky's post-rapporteur of the Alliance of International North-West Divisions in Poland.
Lipka has long been acting as the representative of the head of the Czech army.
The government proposed an increase in the land at the end of June.
Since the beginning of August, Brigadier General Karl Žehk's replacement to the position of representatives of the heads of the international division of the North East in Poland, which is led by an alliance of the alleged presence in Poland and the Netherlands.
In March he became Director of the National Cybernetic and Information Security Authority (NUKIB).
The government has proposed that Lipkov spend the amount of the Brigadier General.
According to the Law on Military Appeals, the higher number of soldiers may be hired at the time of the performance of the elected function or at the time of the performance of the service task required by the higher frequency of the award.
The position of the Deputy Director of the Alliance Division corresponds to the overall value.
A soldier to whom the value was paid has the same rights and obligations as if he were named in this amount.
But there is no damage to the adjustment of the payment that would respond to the given amount.
The increase in volume remains to a minimum of the reason for which it was granted.
"The Colonel Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a model for the subjects.
In a significant way, the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and the security of participation in foreign operations, are shared," said the Ministry of Defence in June on an increase proposal.
The average increase is effective at 12:30 in Prague City, attended by Minister of Defence Lubomir Metnar or chief general of Aleš Opata.
EU countries have Coronaviral Standards for Flights
The countries of the European Union agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel, which should help to limit the spread of the new Coronavir.
He announced it to the German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the maintenance of the distance or the loading of the tyres at the airport and at the airport, however, the average seats at the airports will not be left unattended.
She's been informing the top Reuters agency.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to comply with these uniform standards," Scheuer introduced the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by the officials and that they still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures shall include the requirement to close the mouth and nose for a six-year travel period, to maintain the recommended departure during safety checks and flight recovery.
The aircraft must also have a clean air supply and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to accommodate the middle seat.
The common rules agreed by the authorities meet at least some of the requirements of airlines.
Different standards have also led to fraud.
At the Arctic Špicbergkas, the temperature record fell, reaching about 22 degrees.
"In Longyearbyen, a 41-year-old record has fallen," said the Norwegian Meteorological Institute on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature was 21.7 degrees Celsius, with a record of 0.4 degrees above the record from 1979.
Longyearbyen is the largest city in Špicberkákás, located about 1,300 kilometers north of the island.
Spicbers burn faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from the landing of other end of the Arctic - from Aljašky to Sibiř, is presented in the London report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
The average temperature in Špicberkákás, according to it, grew from 70 C.E. by three to five degrees.
By 2100, it can even rise to 10 degrees if it does not reduce the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
The growth of the temperature can result in the densely cold soil in Špicberkák, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can also cause a greater number of lakes and lakes of land.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic faunas, such as cold bears or tunnels, which depend on ice cover of the ocean.
Britain, who will return from Spain, is waiting for a two-day quarantine
The British Cabinet also called for the risk of the spread of covid-19 to avoid all roads to the state of Spain which are not necessary.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, after their return, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force on Monday.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," said the British diplomat in his statement.
"We have always made it clear that if this is necessary, we will immediately remove from the list of these safe countries," he added.
As noted by the British letter Metro, the latest announcements will affect the travel plans of thousands of Brits.
Spain is also one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Brits have other concerns, whether they will be paid in small amounts if they have to end up in isolation within 14 days after their return from the holiday.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne closed a ten-day permit on Lanzarote, had to fly in the afternoon.
They've been ordered by the station since December.
"We were supposed to go all the family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, I don't know what will happen after this announcement.
I work as a driver, and I don't think my employer will agree that I'll be back in quarantine for two weeks after being released," said Mr. Metro Hunter.
As regards Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemics.
During the last two days, there were more than 900 new entrants every 24 hours.
In some areas, authorities have already speeded up coronavir measures, such as Catalanus trying to limit all night life and to prevent people from getting caught in great numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs further warned of the increased risk of incidents in Catalan, Aragonia, Basque and the region of Madrid.
Model of electricity purchase from Dukovan government
The government in the subsidized electricity purchase model from the planned new block Jaderná electricity Dukovany.
The proposal is based on the fact that in the event that the cost price is higher than the price of force electricity on the market, the difference will be paid to all consumers by means of tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be negative.
Power electricity is an uncontrolled part of the final price of electricity for the receiver.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for the UN) and the ČEZ energy company have already indicated that the most likely option is that people are thanks to electricity saving.
On the other hand, analysts note that the long-term view of electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The aim has already been criticised by environmental organizations.
"The purchase price may be as low as the market price of power electricity, so above it.
The final impact in the time of application of the rules can be as negative as positive.
The impact is divided between customers according to the size of the jury - whether by lower consumption or by electricity consumption - by higher electricity consumption," said the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO).
In the spring, Havlček pointed out that he predicts that a large commercial price of electricity is being made by dust and people at the Dukovan building.
In a negative case, there will be an impact in tens of times per year on the family, which is much less than people pay in electricity invoices in support of so-called supported sources.
Previously, he suggested that the purchase price could move between 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 Kč) for megawattodine (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposed amount, shall be contained in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for the year 2021, which is now the largest storer, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 Kč) per MWh.
"In the difference between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity in a maximum of ten euros, it could make an average household tax with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four-fold households, normally equipped with electricity, including electric safe discs and trucks, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and heating of hot water - a few 100 Kč/year," wrote the MPO government.
"We are living in a turbulent time.
The Coronavir pandemic showed us how harmful the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecast of market prices to be highly speculative," ČTK said previously Executive Director of the Energy Financial Group group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law shall be calculated by implementing the MPO, respectively, by a legal person owned by the State prior to the price laid down.
The agreement between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity to be closed for at least 30 years, with the possible extension of ten years, and this is repeated, however, only to the end of the low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production proposal defines as a production power with a nuclear reactor connected to an electrical system with an installed capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
The trailer previously indicated that a new shower block should have a output of 1200 MW and make nine terawatthodine electricity annually, corresponding to the ten-day expected Czech consumption.
The block should be introduced into operation in 2036.
The funding model for the new Duchy Block was approved by the government in the afternoon.
The facility should be financed annually by the state during the construction, which shall be calculated by a two-percent rate for the operation.
The financing model does not agree with the opposition, and it also provides the possibility that Dukovani would create Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should share 70 percent of the building.
The remainder should be paid to the company ČEZ, which will also build all any additional costs.
ČEZ Director-General Daniel Benez said in April ČTK that the expected sum for the construction of the block at the current prices is six billion euros (about 162 billion kroner).
The agreements between the State and the Czech Republic on the construction of a new Duchy block will be signed in the afternoon.
The Ministry for Local Development has become a two billion media support material
Material intended by the Ministry for Local Development (MMR) to lose in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising allowed in Czech, two billion kroner was left to the office of the memory management.
Minister Klara Dostalov (for the UN) server List of Reports.cz said that it is still working on the material.
The document in eKlepu (Electronic Library of the Legislative Process) was notified on Friday by Zdöry.cz.
The Ministry of Planning has caused the damage of road traffic due to the Coronavir.
During the Coronavir crisis, revenue and media losses were recorded.
The proposal called for a criticism of opposition and representatives of the road movement.
According to the proposal that is now under review on the lydacstat.cz website, MMR has been planning to provide money for advertising on television, radio, press, Internet, billboards or flats on the streets by means of the CzechTourism.
The biggest part of the money, and it's 700 million kroner to get TV.
Most of them would get private TV Nova and Prima.
Clear figures and weeks would get 400 million and the same share would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the web pages.
The Rozhla stations would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of which are private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces on platforms or in meters.
The campaign to support the travel movement in Czech had to start in half of August and last year.
"It is still working on the material, which is certainly not the same as it should be presented," said Dostalov, without further details from the Report List server.
Material criticised opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markets of Pekar Adams would benefit from advertising from media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrey Babies (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this show-up will get on the floor in the morning with the eyes," she wrote on Twitter.
It turns out it's actually about helping the media with the crisis.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," said Denik N on Friday.
According to it, the budget is two billion oriental.
"Of course we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's a work material," he added.
Initiative Save tourism does not provide a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies on the road, not the rest of the advertising campaign," the president of Tomáš Barčík said on Sunday.
If those two billion crowns are found in the national budget, they should be directed by the company, never by the media, to write an initiative in the government's open letter.
Life-threatening, drinking beer and death as a tree table
He is also the third album titled A death is the style of a bronchian poet, an outstanding organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslava Erika Friče, who also left the year ago, on 24 May.
In the French discography, the fifth position is the same as in the previous titles, and here is the main source of the French poetry, which is the very real interpreter.
Frič, in 1949, was profoundly influenced by the American Beat generation, and this inspiration was also observed through his own personal experiences and also by many non - believers.
There was also some aggression on his shoulders when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, unaggressive, simply tolerant.
He attacks me in this relationship with Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníčk), the masters are prominent.
Frič's album offers a record of the author's reading since 2006, but also the performance with the singers who always made it very sensitive, whether it was already a violinist Josef Klč, or Honza Barton and the winner of the Holat.
Help me - I like - the words of the island poet Petra Hrušky about the long fads.
"It has sent down mountains and endless heat," writes Hruška, "to the position of our world by a threatened curse.
The world, which continues to thrive on the perpetuity of consummity and greed, is increasingly alienated from what his soul was created - from the mystery of faith, mercy and human intimacy.
In them he called the conclusion of who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that only because of the general lack of interest can't express them.
They certainly remembered that a person may have to come to all the dear ones, but it's not how it will be.
If he sells himself to a general accident, he refuses to be sceptically quiet, or he will remain in a quiet and proud state for the last time."
Paraubek is not my counselor, Hamaček said
Former Prime Minister and President Jírí Paroubek is not a paying adviser to social democracy.
The Chairman of the Party and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamack said it on Prima Partie's TV show today.
About Paraubek should be Hamáč's adviser, the server informed on Friday List of Reports.cz.
"From time to time we write an essay, he often sends me some material and I read it," Hamaček said today.
He added, however, that he did not agree on official and paid cooperation.
According to him, ČSSD has no means to spread it for similar purposes.
"It's that I read his opinion often, so many people like this," he said.
In the next discussion with ODS Ambassador Janu Černoch said that many ODS members still "response to the views of Václava Klaus".
This is according to him, because it's about the experienced policy and the former chairmanship of the party, which is also the case of Paroubka.
The fact that they're making an affrey from that media is a sign of the annual crop season.
Server List of Reports.cz wrote on Friday that Parubek is a full role of Hamáčk's informal consultant.
He also wrote that, in the fourth place of the candidate country, a certain president of the dark tower of Peter Benda, which is connected with Paroubk, was acting as chairman of the LEV 21.
Hamack said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a love jump, he's a cop in the back, he's a Swedish caller.
A 22-year-old American poet has ambition and potential to belong to the most important competitors of the new government.
He already knows what it is about two years younger Duplantise to win, Loni won her at the NCAA University's mythical association.
"We had a fight a year ago, then he won and I was second, then we passed it.
In both cases it was a very good file," says Nilsen, who made his victory a success of 5.95 meters.
Since that time, Duplantis has only fired a stream of mountains and is currently located in the highest tidal regions.
In just 20 years, he became a world recorder, and on February 8, he crossed the lake at a height of 6.17 metres, and a week later, he added a centimetre.
"He was six meters away in 18 years when he finished high school," recalls his founder, Nilsen, for the World Games website.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up from a boy in a man, all his potential and talent were realized.
Twenty years is quite a good age to break the world record," he thinks.
Being Nilsen's record of success is more important than knowing what Duplantis is doing, the American is pursuing similar goals.
Meanwhile, he pointed out his options at the NCAA, which he won regularly, and on one of them, he improved his internal personal record at 5.93. Loni received gold medals at the Pan American Games in Lima in August, and in 2017 he was engaged in American training at the World Championship, where he ended 13.
Then the closest lover to him is first to taste the Diamond League.
"It's definitely my priority to get to the professional class and do as much as you can in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name," he admits.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same in actions such as Olympic games, the world's mysteries or the Pan American games."
Because of the pandemic, however, these high holidays are rebuffed, which gives Nilsen and other fans time to improve.
But it'll be enough to take Duplantise, which is easy for the race under five circles to change into a single glass file?
"Everyone tries to reach it, but I don't think it will be possible in the near future," Nilsen observes.
"This guy's been kicking for 16 years and he's got all the other love jumps."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, he's gonna want to find her again.
A woman lost statistics from the invalidity debt of an unaccompanied son.
She's waiting for her trial.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as an invalid pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
A woman is threatened with rape for up to eight years.
Because of a poor health situation, the court of the sick man had delivered the case of his right of residence, and his mother had set up a guardian who had to save money and his sons.
"A woman from the half of November 2013 to the summer of the year used part of the financial resources of the invalid son's pension for her needs and prepared it at 440 thousand crowns," said police spokesman Dana Ladman, stating that the accused woman insisted that she had in particular an obligation to cover the interests of the injured person.
According to the court's instructions, the woman arranged for the son's account to be sent to her account.
"After payment of the costs associated with the stay of the son in the medical facility and the compensation of the necessary medicines, she used the remaining financial resources for the purchase of vehicles, electricity and household goods," she laments.
That he can't use his son's money for his needs, the woman admitted.
But she was happy to help them pay for their family expenses.
"We had problems with our incomes to escape homelessness.
We've never bought anything of a standard.
It was always on the thing the son would accept.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't hesitate to allow this to happen," the woman explained to the police.
She promised her son's money would come back.
North America has been isolated for 30 000 years, says scientists after finding tools
Searches from the Chiquihuite lakes in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include the 1930s of the baths, among which there are also beautiful sharps that could be used for cooking meat, and spicy objects that could serve as hooves or cups.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools are from 33 000 to 31 000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this old age here.
But they are here," archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the principal author of one of the two studies published in Nature magazine on this subject.
The latest tools reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, people living in Chiquihuite’s lakes, located at a large sea level, have lived for some 20,000 years.
According to the generally accepted theory, the first representatives of the Homo sapiens passed through the state bridge of Russia today in Aljaška 13 500 years ago.
The archaeological evidence, including the unique sizes of copies used to kill mammals and other prehistoric animals, showed that this clover culture has subsequently expanded in much of North America.
However, this model was obtained in recent decades when several long sentences, which were two to three thousand years older, were revealed.
In the second study published in Nature magazine, there are 42 different locations throughout North America that show human presence on the continent already in the period from 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could come to North America before it was predicted.
Some were able to get ships in America.
"It is clear that people in America were long before the development of so-called clofic culture," said anthropologist Ruth Grün of the University of Canada, Albert's province.
The interest in flying is now filling up an optimistic scenario, claims the seller.
The prices are gradually reduced.
He sells a plane to Czechs every week.
Unlike last year, interest is still half-life, but demand increases every week by up to 20 percent.
After the crisis, according to the sellers, evolution complements the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of the airport are gradually reduced.
The most sought destinations are according to the sellers, in particular the southern European States.
According to the Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece.
The airport of Letuska.cz is the largest to sell flights to the Croatian Split.
In other countries, then, it is the most sought-in-the-great Britain, which has always belonged to the highest destinations.
It also decreases the average flight price.
In the port of Letuska.cz, the hole moved about 6250 kroner in half a month, an average of 3000 kroner less.
This is largely due to an increase in demand for a European destination, which now constitutes about 85 per cent of sales.
They also cover the same prices in some European places, such as Spain or Italy in the past few weeks, about five times.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who now buy flights much less than before because they are afraid of further developments in the coronavir situation.
According to previous information Kiwi.com, the purchase time of the flight was reduced by an average of ten days before the departure.
"It confirms this future trend when people will order flights with much less advance, they will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice-President for Kiwi.com Shindelar.
Currently, the average booking time is 21 days ago.
With sales growth, the number of renewed flights from Czech Republic is increasing.
At present, regular lines to more than 60 destinations are available on the Prague airport.
It's about half of the destination against the London summer season.
Big finals already tonight!
Follow the Up-To-Date Battle of New Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organisation led to a great finale.
It presents an experienced nine-thirty-year-old Scottish poet, Gary Anderson, and the surprise of the tournament, six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson ordered Justin Pip on the first train, then found his neighbor in the table hat.
However, he consulted James Wadm, and in the fourth, he was very pleased to meet Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent the world's unit home.
"Aeroplane Scot" had a clue in the semifinals when Michael Smith was driving.
At the last minute, however, he fled the dignitaries from the hunt, in prolonged domination, and after the outcome 18:16 he fought a place in the final tournament, which he had already ruled in 2018 when Mensura Sullovice 21:19 died in a great battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament, and the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play a purely fantastic game.
The six-year-old skirmisher first miraculously ordered the world's sixth Nathan Aspinalla, and in a dramatic battle, too, Joa Cullena and in the fourth finals after the sharp appearance of Adrian Lewis.
The big check was semi-final.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the start, but in the calm playing Belgian then the winning series gained a leap which, in most cases, remained without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in the high care he experienced temporary insecurity on the doubles.

According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with Coronavir are treated with cancer, 19 of which are important to doctors.
In Czech, there's a few fires that can't be covid-19.
The largest recorded in the last seven days in the budget for 100 thousand inhabitants is still present in Karvinsko, which is approximately 59.
It follows the period of Jihlav with 56 and Fridecko-Mistecko with 36 trained population of 100 thousand in the past week.
As a result of an increase in the number of payments received in Czech since Saturday, new measures against the spread of Coronavir have been taken.
People have to wear roses on internal collective shares over 100 people, it's cultural and sports, but it's also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, then, the capacity of these actions will be limited from the current thousands of people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have apparently raped a new Coronavir has exceeded the limit of 16 million.
It was introduced by the U.S. University of Johnse Hopkins, which is closely monitored by the development of the pandemic.
The balance of victims who died with poor covid-19 is estimated to be 645 thousand.
The latest million infected came to statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on 22 July.

It's going to be a record storm now.
The World Health Organization announced this week that from Thursday to Friday more than 284 thousand new cases have occurred worldwide, which is the highest daily balance since the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to an increase in the number of new cases in recent weeks in almost 40 countries around the world in the United States, Brazil or India, according to Reuters.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The evidence has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, and the first case today has been officially announced by KLDR.
The air in the homes is up to five times higher than the outside.
Health damage to air pollutants and deodorants
Health threatens not only the bad air quality in outer areas but also the home.
She warned the Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, who had already quoted The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was responsible for the establishment of the Israeli Ministry of the Protection of the Environment, it is necessary to focus on domestic damages right now when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times higher than the external.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that because of the bad air quality in its homes, it kills 3.8 million people a year ago.
"Because of the epidemic of Coronavir, which has led many to and continues to have to work from home, people must spend more time at home than before, so it's time to focus on air quality in households," Abraham said.
In Israel, according to it, the quality of "home air" is almost forgotten.
Danger can be things with which a person often comes into contact - insulation, air pollutants, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"Earth flames also produce clothes that we regularly carry into the kitchen," said Abraham.
Children, elderly members of the household and people with breathing problems are most at risk.
Also, the health of individuals can begin to suffer problems such as headaches, nausea, nausea, nausea, nose bleeding, vomiting or skin allergy.
In the long term exposure of untreated substances, internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all damages, but come from items inside the house, can also be material from which houses are built.
