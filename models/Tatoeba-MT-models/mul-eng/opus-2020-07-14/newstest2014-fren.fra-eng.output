Spectacular healthy in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Sports player Jonathan Florez greeted a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
A wingsuit (a small island combination), it passed 160 km/h above the famous monasteries of Monserrate, located over 3,000 metres high, where many baths were gathered to observe its exploitation.
A black box in your car?
While the U.S. road network planners have a bad idea of finding the money needed to repair the road infrastructure in the short term, many of them are in the form of a small black box that is placed above the board table of your car.
The devices, which record all the thousands of cars and transmit information to staff, are at the centre of an attempt in Washington and in the government offices of planning to maintain the absolute funding system of the major American roads.
The sector, generally uninterested in the planning of large axes, has suddenly led to a strong debate and strong alliances.
The libertarians joined ecologist groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel, then use the information to edit a draft tax law.
The Tea Party is on fire.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of private life.
And while members of the Congress do not agree to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how they will be able to go through a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands of cars.
Thousands of car drivers have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental virus.
This is very important to our nation.
"It's not as if we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director-General of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the State begins to record thousands of cars charged by each California car from 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed by the US pump taxes, is financially dried.
The Americans don't get as high as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a thousand miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased since 20 years.
The political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 percent, while the prices of the essence are high.
"The tax on essence is simply not relevant," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at Minnesota University.
Its State recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a payment system to the mile.
"This seems to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wunks calls it the cost of using the mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea is sedulating the liberarians, as taxes could be used to change behavioural habits in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planners of California are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious laws on climate recovery.
However, the representative, Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Committee on Transport of the Chamber of Representatives, stated that he would also consider it the most viable option in the long term.
The free market participants of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of paying drivers to the mill.
"It's not just a tax that is engaged in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Policy at Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they are seeking.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Secretaries to Transport, who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move in the way of payment to the millennium.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-m pilot project last year that would have carried about 10,000 cars.
However, the House's presidency has killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing electors who must travel thousands of miles every day to work or city.
Many States and large cities, however, are making progress on their own.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These drivers will soon be paid to the State of mileage costs rather than to taxes on the essence.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City has an idea.
Illinois is trying a test on a number of trucks.
And Coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the coast of America (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studied how it could implement the change.
The concept is not universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer car drivers recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their fewer facts and actions.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategic management of performance at the Department of Transport in Nevada.
It's not something people want.
Since the start of the test, the NEVADAC has warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into fully localized devices."
There is no need to build a huge and comprehensive technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to preserve the records of the people's daily trips and arrivals.
Nevada is part of some States that are now seeking access to an affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles a car is going, but not knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do this, Khan added, citizens will be more at ease.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small start-up from California on the name of True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not intend to help car drivers paying taxes to States.
She was looking forward to entering the emerging market of car insurance, where drivers would pay for their mileage.
But the devices tested have more of the major axis planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't register their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Serious errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are less honorary means and less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering car drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have all the equipment, preferring to pay a fee based on the average number of thousands per capita in the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to poor citizens by allowing them to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport operators are seeking to develop a tax device that would also be equipped to pay the costs of the station, provide a "performance payment" insurance, and create a set of data on the real-time speed from other drivers that car drivers could use to avoid the packaging.
"The motorists would be encouraged to participate in the benefits offered by the system," said a document on urban planning.
Some transport planners, however, wonder whether the whole debate on payment to the mill is not simply a huge difference.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission in the Bay area of San Francisco, officials say Congress could easily manage the failure of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing the tax on the essence.
A single or additional annual fee could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on others whose vehicles do not consume much of the essence, so that each payment is its fair share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when there is simply a need for aspirin," stated Randy Rentschler, the director of public law and affairs with the Commission.
If this is done, hundreds of millions of car drivers will be concerned about the protection of their private life and a load of other things.
David Bowie: Four Inneds in Listen
The English musician didn't end up surpriseing this year.
From The Next Day, born in January, he invented a luxury edition scheduled for November 4, with several Ineditions.
Four have already emerged on the Alley.
The announcement of the appearance of a new album by David Bowie left the whole world behind.
On its 66th anniversary, on 8 January 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disc, Reality, date 2003) and too rare appearances in the public, the English musician proved that he could still be relied on to speed up the pop scene.
A party for her fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than a tour in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke thus planned to edit this album on November 4th.
For the occasion, he celebrated a true festival for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in three forms: the original album, independent studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four already opened clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain the total 10 additional titles in relation to the original album: the three pieces of Deluxe edition, five songs specially released for the occasion, and two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful cover in a video.
It introduced both of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a card to share its own impressions, a book with words...
And, above all, it gives a preview of its new Atomica title, typically on the road of The Next Day, with very early guitars and a highly mastered rock electricity.
Inhibits already heard
But Atomica is not the only title to release her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the toilet.
The Informer is on double-faced: an intrusion in front of a light cavalcade that progressively slows down to place on a pop ballade.
On Like A Rocket Man, does Bowie want to make a little reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, even to Gravity?
With this title added, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has feet on earth.
Space Odity, on the other hand, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie made a new reference to his foreignness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, sending, give you the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie strives in any case to play on the camel with these titles: touring informant tour, man on the side of a Fusada, potential martien...
It is dissimulate and manifests both, playing to adopt different personalities, as it has done all along its career, including its personalities Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Not surprisingly, therefore, he had a mask in his hand in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to the Travel, of the brand Louis Vuitton, which he wore the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising sites, broadcast from 10 November.
Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, stressed that wounded soldiers were not only released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army would follow a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them have been released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the Government of wanting to save money by not allowing the wounded soldiers - which does not comply with the military 'university of service' rule requiring staff to be able to carry out a variety of tasks - to reach the period of 10 years of eligibility required for withdrawal benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadiane, including one of a freed soldier last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London tanker in Ontario, was released from the army despite his request to stay a year longer in order to receive a fully indexed withdrawal.
His case was followed by Colonel Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been moved to the exit before being ready because he did not respond to the universality rule of the service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultations, but that was completely different from the fact that he wanted to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with the Canadian Press Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major wars in Afghanistan, the army has been trying to determine what flexibility it can give the wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but who are not fit for the fight.
Under the current rules, the severely injured soldiers have suffered for up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that 199 of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons did not reach the required service duration to obtain withdrawal benefits.
The liberal spokesman for the former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked mercred to reintegrate Captain Hawkins, while neo-democrat Jack Harris claimed the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney set on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney decided to privileged the tablets to its own television channels for the next issue of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunionor.com site or through its application for telephones and tablets.
Its global launch on the Disney group chain is only planned in 2014, detailing the release of its Disney Junior division.
The animated design, designed for children from 2 to 7 years of age, relates the adventures of Callie's cat, the sheriff of a city in West America where she controls the order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interneting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, vice-president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the Communication.
This kind of experience among Disney's efforts to "extreme the life span of its series and build new relationships with its public thanks to more important digital platforms," he added.
A weekly survey published by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of those under 2 years have already served on a tablet or phone, and 72% of those under 8 years, respectively 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "co-operation" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the spokesman for the American Information Services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
German President Hans-Christian Ströbele met Judi Snowden in Russia, where he was entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter submitted to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as an escape and seeks to criminalize political talks with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to abandon the criminal charges held against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he was charged with spying and flight of State goods.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make it possible for us to do so."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been severely tested following complaints by NASA on the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary group that oversees foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden witness "without endangering him and completely destroying relations with the United States, he would have to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, German President, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he would have to assure him that he would be "safe" there, he said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had made the subject of a "great and sustained persecution campaign" that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to "my political expression act".
Citizens from all over the world as well as high officials, including the United States, have concluded that the discovery of an inexplicable system of permanent monitoring was of public interest.
The letter went on to offer cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cageco Cable could soon offer interactive television
Cogeco Cable subscribers could have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and finally the video service on Netflix's application via their television in a future that doesn't look so far.
The Cogeco branch indicated Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests on the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to value more converge interfaces as well as more options," explained the president and head of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in the interview.
Cageco Cáble thus avoids its competitors, like Bell, even though the Cogeco branch has not yet accurate date on this new platform.
"The need to adapt and change or resist change and forget," stressed Mr. Audet.
The last goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The DG Rogers has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service said to be in discussions with some major cable distributors in order to make their service available through their distribution platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cáble also welcomed the announcement made by the Government of Harper in his speech to the Throne on October 16th.
Ottawa wants to strengthen cable and satellite television providers to provide customers with the opportunity to pay card services.
"It's been almost two and a half years and we say that the idea of forceing consumers to buy important chains is not working," said Mr. Auded.
However, it is hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will be based on interesting recommendations.
"There will be a new kind of reference framework for these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cageco.
The CRTC has been consulting the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the coming spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated that he had recorded a net profit of 43.8 million to the fourth quarter, or 82.
This is a recluse compared to the net benefit of 44.9 million, or 83 · by action, of the same period in the last year.
The company established in Montréal explains the cost of savings related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor established in the United States in 2012 for 1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
In December last, the demonstration company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for the income of Cogeco, they knew an increase of 41.5 per cent in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net benefit of its main branch, Cogeco Cáble, was 43.9 million, or 90 million by action, in proportion to 45.7 million or 93 million by action, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Céble's income has grown from 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers in Cogeco Cáble is 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about seeing the number of clients running out of luck.
For me, this is not the indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It's different from one quarter to the other with a very live competition.
From horses to cattle products
Of the horse meat was cut off in the storage boxes of beef-based products, sold by two British low-cost distribution schools, today announced the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in Romania in January and sold by Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained 1-5 per cent of horses' DNA.
"As the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes has spread out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's examinations, France was the country most affected by the presence of this kind of meat in censored products containing only beef.
A collision between two vehicles took four wounded, early Friday, on route 131, in Lanaudeière.
Not before 4 hours ago, a car driver traveling north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost his car master and lost a car coming in the other direction.
The four owners of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The movement was returned to normal at 6 p.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay the baggage manually
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers carrying bags on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a handbag and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its Wednesday announcement, it indicated that passengers could carry the unopened pen with them to the bottom of the plane.
The new hand luggage costs relate to the bags set in the upper room, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said she would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the ship's door.
Frontier's spokesman, Kate O'Malley, indicated that $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the costs in advance.
"We do not want to pay this price," she explained.
Air carriers started paying the first and second bags recorded in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as much things as they could in the bags in the upper compartments, so there was often no more space in these compartments.
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said these new costs will not really serve to collect money.
This is to make sure that customers from Frontier understand the most faithful that it becomes increasingly difficult to find the place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger making the boat at a port of Frontier could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the boat could have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before arriving at the door.
Frontier baggage costs will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often look at baggage costs and other costs, but airlines worship them.
They believe that the maintenance costs of baggage are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people at Wall Street view the addition of baggage costs as a sign that air companies pay enough rent to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them have not been affected by baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first luggage costs three years ago, and the low-cost Allegian company followed a little later.
The only other company taxing such costs is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to Air Company Jay Sorensen, who follows closely the additional costs.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the costs of Spirit's luggage were $50m per year.
Sorensen, an old Midwest Airlines framework, recently traveled on Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the shipping door when passengers would discover the unusual baggage costs imposed by the company.
"I've never seen a shipping procedure so liquid from all my professional career," he said.
I was expecting to see toothbrushes and a bagar to open the door.
The plane was full, he added, "passers are mounted on board at the speed of lighting".
Frontier also makes like Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can carry the unopened chicken with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved for free.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after passengers complained and no other large airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay cash costs when passengers do not directly pay their ticket to the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Air companies pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to purchase directly from them instead of online travel agencies.
Frontier, however, is more far away in this area.
In September, she began to offer only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their tickets through a online travel agency.
Wednesday, it reduced the premiums of 25 per cent on a trip.
Thus, a 1000-mile Frontier trip purchased by a online travel agency would result in 250-mile gains.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a faithful client in his city of origin, Denver, but his work is collected and it loses money.
The revenue decreased by 9 % and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13 % during the first quarter, according to the financial results published by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic has tried to redirect Frontier's funds by selling the airline.
The NSA causes an internal error and not information pirates for the panel of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadow declared on Friday that it was a bug that had caused the panel of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers like some have claimed it online.
“NSA.gov has remained unavailable for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” said the spy agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the panel was due to an attack on distributed service tyres [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NASA site had been in use for at least 6 hours, and some users could not always access the site.
More recently, a NASA spokesman indicated to ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was not "not of all" commitments.
No classified information is in danger, explained the password.
At least a group of online hackivists claimed to be responsible for the NSA site panel by a DSD attack.
The DSD attacks are intended to launch a target site until the servers are loaded and the site collapses.
The cyber-attack is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the system.
The NSA also found itself under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticised during the last months after a flood of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programmes – which are part of the NSA's secret files for the agency and disclosed by the former consultant of NASA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused many speculations that the incident this evening was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of them, 200 have not always found a new job.
Delta promised not to let her employees go.
Employees came to see employees directly on the ground, and employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of Delta's Labour Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closing of Delta is in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund owned by this building had options.
Whether he reinvested in the building to continue the operation, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition was very good, there were many new hotels in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else, and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, a director of the Traat Tourism Charter at UQAM Sciences School.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for older people.
In the meantime, four comprehensive hotel projects of almost 600 rooms will be seen here two years ago.
For Titan's GDP, "the buy-in project of Goodyear Amiens will continue with zero employed"
After sending the spy with failed in January for the partial recovery of the Amiens-North site, Maurice Taylor, the PDG of the American pneumatician Titan, says today, is ready to save 333 jobs on the 1,137 that accounts for the tool.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Production, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After you cancelled the vehicle purchase project in January, you are back today.
You have uttered violent attacks and insults, speaking of "soi-disant workers", which "work three hours" every day, of "fous" trade unions, looking at the CGT.
We don't understand this time-out.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to make anyone happy.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a young charming man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best countries.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries eight hours of disabled people work in France.
In India, China and in many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I didn't have any prejudices on France.
What I see, it's a tool that makes good agricultural pines, has good equipment, is well-placed and has space to grow.
Why does Titan need this car so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this car.
But with the right price and the competent workers, it's worth the effort.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear has offered employees a good start-up compensation, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the closed tool at Goodyear.
At the same time, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union which still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens tool with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among some 1,200 current employees of Goodyear.
Mr. Montebourg also needs a Titan commitment before trying to remove the CGT from the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear conclude an agreement on starting payments for all employees.
Then there will be no more employees in the facility.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting-up payments.
If all employees accept them, the vehicle purchase project will continue with zero employed.
How can we provide long-term employment guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg comes to the conclusion that CGT and Goodyear agree and Titan buys the tool, we have a strong intention to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's benefit is low, while supplies and air orders demand
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a drop of orders and air delivery during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based on Montreal, has no further flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft nor information to determine whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious commercial service schedule before September next.
After the inaugural flight of the pilot, about a month and a half ago, the last flight was three times, and the question was then asked whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not at the top of the projections and the course of action collected 8 per cent at the Toronto Forum.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst within the National Financial Bank, dropped his note on Thursday, passing from "super-performance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential of growth in the next quarter or the next two-thirds.
"Although the drop in air delivery has been largely anticipated, we are very disappointed by the beneficiary margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doersken in a customer note.
We believe that Bombardier will register new orders for his CSeries aircraft as soon as the pilot programme is in progress.
However, if no new order has been announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more and more specific about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was launched in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, the number of closed orders for CSeries aircraft is modest up to 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the tests to be carried out in order to validate the company's assurances regarding the energy efficiency and economic potential of the new line aircraft.
At present, the company recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, the president and head of the board, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 closed orders before the first aircraft is placed in commercial service.
The leaders also assured the analysts and the Thursday media by indicating that the program was progressing in accordance with the calendar.
"The test aircraft has not remained on the ground for longer than planned," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that tests on the ground and software updates were planned during the time of the aircraft stop.
Each builder plans differently.
We decided to proceed to a first flight and plan an update period, and that is what we did.
This will be played all along the flight programme.
The second of the five pilots should be sent in the coming weeks, the others will follow after, the company has indicated.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was evaluating the service entry calendar and will provide further information in the coming months.
"This launch of flight tests – although apparently in accordance with Bombardier's internal calendar – strengthens our opinion that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015,” said Mr. Doerssen.
On the third quarter of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 M, or 8 cents per action, compared to 172 M$, or 9 cents per action, a year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged by 9 cent.
The income was slightly collected from 4.2 to 4.1 MD.
Analysts expected 10 cents per share and income of $4.56 Md, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, 57 years earlier.
The net orders were dropped at 26 aircraft, compared with 83 priors.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was 32.9 MD to 30 September, the figure changed from 31 December of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions have been fulfilled," said Mr. Beaudoin.
The Aeronautic revenues fell by 13 per cent to reach $2.Md.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that the revenues of this division had increased by almost 11 per cent to 2.1 MD.
The order card of the Transport Division totaled $32,6 MD to 30 September, or slightly higher than 31 December of the previous year.
The Transport Division's boundaries have suffered implementation problems with regard to some major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The course of Bombardier's actions, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google Inc's financial management, would sit at the board of directors, fell from 8.5 per cent to $4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aeronautical builder in the world and competes in the nearest Bombardier, pointed to a 10% drop in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23-27-year-old speleologists were missing in a golf course under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, they learned Friday with the Issère Speléo.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, the one agarri to practice and the other not, were on the ground of Thursday at 9:30 a.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We then had no news of them since, explained the same source.
"The speleologists should have visited about 5 a.m. in the morning," said Thierry Larribe, a technical adviser to Spéléo in charge of the relief organization.
Tens of people on the ground
Twenty paramedics, ten members of the French Speléo, as well as gendarmes, CRSs and pumpers were on the ground.
At the end of the afternoon of this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after having been exposed to them but in good health in the cage, sent information to one of the relief teams engaged in the network," La Dauphiné explains.
The two soldiers at the 13th battle of Chambéry's Alpine Chambery Chambery's alpine chasseurs were found "repressed, but not injured".
They lost in the network, returned on their steps while waiting for relief, explained the prefecture.
In fact, they should get out of the cage with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
German journalists' union invited Thursday to stop using Google and Yahoo online services in the following year for new insights on the activities of American and British information services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid the new order to use Google and Yahoo's search engines and messages," she said in a communiqué.
It judges "candals" the information of Washington Post, according to which the National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government of Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union that accounts for 38,000 subscribers.
Repeated cases: a member seeks the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels for "relifting" the signal lamps in Brussels does not please the whole world.
In order to remember, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a draft test to repeat 16 signalling lamps in the region to the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The goal is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the end, to repeat all the brussels signalling lights for an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "founded trop", according to the Brussels Member, Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flammation" of the capital and demands Brigitte Grouwels' "demission".
"It is not a pleasure to spend entirely the money of the Brusselss in signalling operations in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its fillance operations in the capital," said Mr. De Bock in a communiqué.
After its yellow-mangue-noir taxes, it finally repeated itself in yellow-white-white-white-newing Brussels’s poets.
According to the delegation, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between the Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselss deserve better than seeing their money collected by a CD&V minister who is implementing the NVA programme itself.
It's a long time to stop Troie de la Flander's horse.
"To remember, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only by 2,245 votes to 0.5% of Brussels!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the port of Pont-de-Buis demounted
The exotic Port of Pont-de-Buis, surrounded by a violent demonstration of opponents at this tax, was demonstrated on Thursday morning.
Grains arrived on the ground shortly after 10 hours, and the movement on the country was turned into a crowd.
The decision of the delegation, announced by the Prefecture of the Mercredi Finistère, was taken by Ecomouv, the port manager.
This is the last of the three ecotaxes in operation in the Finistère department, the two others who were demounted or sabouted.
Launching an accessory shop for Google Glass
A online shop, which offers multiple accessors dedicated to Google Glass, has been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signged satellites.
They can thus acquire an audience, a driver, or even a ranking test.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already available from Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a driver and his USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a micro-fibre protective house or an intra-auricular audience.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with repair glass, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father was expelled from the world of the living.
At first I didn't kill him, I was talking about him right now,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I would continue to "frequent."
There is no income, no employment mode to pass the wall of the invisible and find the coins.
Then signs appear.
The first time this was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
On another occasion, a double night light to look at her show that doesn't leave me anymore, put on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father that accompanys me in my gloves every day.
Our mother left us after she fought cancer.
That's at least what I thought about the day I found his body empty, stuck on this bed of hospital to the frozen bodies.
Also, its funnels were a glazed glass adage around the cave of the canals that would cross its circle.
I thought she was part of it.
Not at all, by small daily or night appearances, a bit shy, a little effigyed, she quickly came back into my mind, moving back to her hair and to the extent that she was taking her place in the landscape of my mind that she believed in.
And then, she'd come all the way out of my own face that I haven't understood yet, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who was pregnant during her lifetime.
By dying, this woman had perfect life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This passage from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that people who love us never leave us.
I look like my father, "on the outside," he's like.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he became old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was wrong...
He talked to me, encouraged me constantly, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I loaned him my body.
But it was never indiscriminate.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me alone.
It's been a long time since one day he's gone.
Finally, it was comforting and comforting to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know anymore who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents aren't anymore, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always mention it: what would they have said? What would they have thought? What would they have done?
I'm constantly dreaming of them, maybe not all night, but several times a week is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, but there's always something that keeps me going.
I often wake up excited when this happens to me and I feel deeply about their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams bring me to the opposite and into my history and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The sight of my echograph, where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed I woke up, I was out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor, and he would laugh at me and happy that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my bedroom to mean that he would happily share what had happened to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I'd like to tell you this common memory after his death.
Just five years ago, my mother was going to die of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family in Cuba.
It's the shock that his disappearance caused the young bastard I was at the time.
I did everything I could fast enough.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times of difficulty, or even when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to make a master in a large school, was not, with the rest, anadine choices.
In fact, I often heard it from Arabic in my childhood, and from Morocco, where it lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she charged me are always present, although it comes to me to think how she would like me to act at a given moment.
It is the same for my attitude: I try to be at the height of the generosity and right spirit of the one who was a brave believer.
Now I feel like a daily presence, a kind spirit, a lifesaving spirit.
I see his eyes looking at me.
My mother died 15 years ago.
Death after talking to me on the phone.
I am passing through all stages: inconsistency, anger, pain, tears that come out alone, everywhere, at any time, in isolated places, at any moment.
Then time passed.
There's nothing left but the lack, this empty, unresponsible, that's the need to trust me, to comfort me in the hearts of her sweet.
However, she's there, quiet presence, she's there and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see his eyes of concern looking at me, I see the shadows that admire his view, the cuts around the lips that believe in cigarettes, the most that mark the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looked at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes.
My wife and mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We always feel its protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his painful bed, so we were little to smile back, and proclaiming his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I'm talking to him in the middle of the night when the absence is too bad, she's invited in my dreams when moral morality is a little bit achieved.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the rest of the time makes us realize how she was the head of orchestra and we try to stay in the way she has pursued us.
If someone loved you very much, the absence can't draw you from your heart and memories.
In some way, being loved becomes your internal energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from a cancer of the amalgam.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't help her fatigue and three weeks after her death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my opinions sometimes different from yours, I always ask if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in a different way, I don't do it and I always ask what he thinks about it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is this genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like another egg, there was no need to talk to each other.
Bref, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
I fly almost thirty years ago when my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The enormous pain that I then felt has certainly come to an end, but it's always close to me.
Very often it's "dark" in my dreams in such a way that I'm more sad to see that this was not just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I didn't tell him, he said, "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I'm awake, excited, and I lit up the horse lamp looking around, hoping he'd come.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel observed and I come back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all the parts, I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world, I would not leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I have to make it clear that I'm familiar with a mete of responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I'm a big mom, I'm a friend, but my heart and soul belong to him, and I'll never talk to him except my son, and I'll never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the most bleeding month since 2008
October has been Iraq's most deadly month since April 2008.
Baghdad published this sales of official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication took place on the day when the Iraqi Prime Minister was received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be on our side and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will extend, and what is happening in Syria will also extend.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives?
Noury al-Maliki expressed himself to the U.S. Peace Institute, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, demonstrators protested against the Iraqi leader.
They burned him, among others, to be a murderer and called on the United States to refuse to give him help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug dealer of a police investigation was imprisoned.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool District Court.
A large defence lawyer, who had reported a drug parasite of an important police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction was not revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the lord of the crime Neil Scarbrough about his drug-related research after he committed his habit of cocaine consumption.
The lawyer, who was named "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "first important file", was arrested in 2011 following police hearing operations leading to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers reported Sarborough, 32 years old, while depositing three cocaine bags at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a barreau dinner with conflicts.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed cocaine traces in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men for the account of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored by the police at the time in an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire county.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of 1.5 MM, as well as over 200 000 £ in species during a series of rockets.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because he was afraid that his toxicity would not be revealed on the big day.
Today, at Liverpool, Dita, who works in the lawyers' Forbes Solicitors office located in Blackburn, he was disappointed that he had been found guilty of two counts of prosecution in court after a three-week trial.
He had admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The breach of the lawyer occurred after the police investigated on Scarborough found that he had been regularly in contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspicion and reported it to the house of Ditta and taking drugs, 60 per cent below the village of the lawyer in a black golf course.
Not long after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the foot station of Ewood Park, the founder of the Blackburn Rovers Club.
The lawyer returned to him, discovered the drug, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Dita was arrested later but did not use cocaine. He said he had spoken to the drug dealer who was alleged to be his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta wrapped his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all caught and a hair sample was taken from him.
In a questionnaire, he stated that he owned a office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that he was only called by his clients for legal issues.
However, the court heard evidence that he had called for major drug dealers, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them who the investigators were at the scene.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone must know that he does not have to violate the law, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditita was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will certainly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this goes beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He stopped the police investigation as long as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but he disappointed him.
He was too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and he made a commitment to his independence.
Dida refused all illegal action and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, I wasn't, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Lieutenant Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has been a criminal criminal lawyer himself since he began seeking drugs with criminal organizations."
Its addition to cocaine has made it ever and has made it vulnerable to the back-up of members of organized criminal groups who have been responsible for obtaining valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta expressed this confidence and tried to open up behind the scenes of his profession.
The unit responsible for the serious and organised crime of Lancashire conducted the investigation on Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three heads of cocaine possession and now in the process of justice, bearing witness to his commitment to continue the crimes in justice.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you to the courts.
Scarborough himself has been imprisoned for 14 years after he has applied for a complicity of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/responsibility session on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to represent customers in the death cycle in America, his last dinner invitation would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will remount on stage in December

The airport is in the process of evacuation and the air traffic is interrupted.
From classical song for teenagers
Each time, it is the school client who will be targeted, an initiative that was well-known in the course of the previous season.
Through five scenes imagined and interpreted by the artists of the region, wines containing a strong dose of humor, young people are allowed to enjoy classical music.
In addition to this show, the lyric art Society of the Kingdom will come back with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now makes a living room in the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
In these activities the Lyric Apero was added, the concert-beneficiary held in August last, with the concert of the soprano coloring Marie-Éve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the unprofitable organization to produce a financial balance that is both gentle in the ears and air of La key.
Without providing specific figures, the President of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to show his satisfaction.
Despite the precarility that is the lot of such cultural institutions, the future is well planned, even in the long term.
We have more solid and constant support.
"The funds are in flow and we hope to endure until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will break in seven years," said the administrator.
"I'd say even there," added general director Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.

Omar Mustapha Hassan was charged with arrest, sequencing, threat prevention, arms port in a dangerous, escape, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid response of the police involved and their ability to eliminate the situation immediately was essential to the security conclusion of the incident," said Cap. Bert Packett by communication.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to be present on Friday.
New collective appeal against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new collective appeal was filed against the brothers Sainte-Croix regarding sexual assaults that would occur this time in the office of St. Joseph, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the witness of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", which would have been masturbed in the 1950s, first to Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, his brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the office of St. Joseph, where he was serving as a carpenter and where his father worked as a painter.
The first resort was only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us, "I was in such a place, can I be registered?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that is due to be lodged has in particular been to allow for the addition of complainants from any institution where sevedes could have been made by members of the Sainte-Croix Congregation.
At the present time, the appeal gathered the complaints of 25 persons who claimed to have been attacked by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also emphasizes that the congregation of Sainte-Croix and the Oratorium of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "has allowed sexual intercourse to be perfect in the face of children", that they have "perceived and knowingly chosen to ignore the problem".
These last accusations are based on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers Sainte-Croix, Me Emile Perrin in the 1990s, but also by the research done in the archives by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an old brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the vices.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Supreme Court.
Once accepted by the Court, the hearings on the ground are held at the second stage.
In the case of the first appeal, the Sainte-Croix Congregation had agreed to regulate the friendly before hearings were conducted on the ground.
Importing fire in a trade
A fire has severely damaged a trade from LaSale, Montreal, in the night of Thursday to Friday.
The aid was called to 1h, Friday, due to a fire that was declared on the ground from an Indian cuisine restaurant on the Dollar Avenue, near the intersection with the Rejane Street.
Thirty-three pumps that have been loaded on the premises have spent about an hour mastering the Brazilians.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building", said the chief of the fire safety services of Montreal, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the pumpers arrived on the scene.
There were no damages, but almost twenty houses, located at the first and second stages of this commercial location, had to be evacuated.
The Croix-Rouge was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily accommodated, indicated the SIM.
Many opposition to medical help to die at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Congress on Palliative Care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, will be held a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the medical aid bill to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the patients had access to effective care to cope with their suffering, as well as to stay home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a Canadian palliative care association spokesman, Maryse Bouvette.
If the emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach of euthanasia would be minimal.
The President of the Québec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences of the next generation.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care houses will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also head of the house Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless in any way.
We never ask: "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec Bill deplores the people of the Palliative Care.
He doesn't think Ontario's gonna buy it.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the notion of the end of life should be clarified before the draft law was adopted.
Kenyan press is against the media dispute law
"It is a frustrating country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will the Parliament do to prevent the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper in reply to the draft law and asking what was said inconstitutional.
"This law is dragonnic and very criminal, and we refuse it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group – Owner of CapitalFM, one of the radio stations and independent Internet sites in Kenya.
He stated that the new media court "will always be partial because it is a extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would be imposed on Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it to parliamentarians," he added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "handling on the media". The Standard has, as for him, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had taken a heavy toll" and the draft bill had been abolished as a "draconian".
At the same time, the adoption of the draft law involves a step towards strengthening national security in the shadow of the attack by armed Islamists in the commercial centre of Westgate in September.
The Kenyan media provoked the anger of the authorities by spreading images of video surveillance cameras on which groups deployed on the attack scene were at the centre of the luxury trade.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them, even though the call was subsequently withdrawn from a blindfold in the media.
Under the new bill, the media will be able to be able to pass up to up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "radiated" or unable to obtain official press accreditation.
The court has also the power to seize the property of an opponent if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single measure is enough to parallel most of the FM stations. ”
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "anonymous blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, political men know that they can do what they want at all times.
“ No one will ever be able to do it, ” wrote Mutuma Mathou, a journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, the political men would put the country in failure and would strike us to the castle and to the kitchen."
The Kenyan legislators were the target of the anger of the people in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission on Salaries and reimbursed their monthly salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month, which are among the highest in the world.
A hard year for pharmaceuticals
The departure of close to 10 pharmacies at the Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) in Laval caused a total of confusion in the direction of the City-de-la-Santé Hospital, which was held in 2012-2013.
Because of multiple departures, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmaceutical department has found a strong deficit in staff.
Nearly 30 per cent of the necessary costs were lost, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSS has decided not to commit independently, which may cost up to three times more than a full-time drug.
We didn't take advantage of the addiction, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities have been rationalised or reduced within the facility to pay, the time that things are replaced.
Of course, we have worked hard to interest our young people [pharmaceans] so that they can come and stay here.
There was a competition in circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this period, 2013-2014 is more easily announced for the CSS Pharmacy Department.
Already, three pharmacovigilants are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacovigilants have been released in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the Department to maintain had results, as the four students currently resident in Laval also decided to remain in the employment of the CSS.
Now, it's going to be a lot better, highlighted the pharmacokinetics.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmaceuticals and three maternity returns.
So this will bring our departures from the past year.
The need for continuous growth
However, the situation remains fragile.
Several factors, such as the shortage of patients in the hospital or the prevalence of young women in the metire, make it difficult to predict situations such as those in 2012.
For us [the number of factors] is always predictive, because we have a young environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with the grandmothers, we always roll almost to three maternity leavers when it's okay, it added.
In the last year, there was much more and there were no medicines available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career at the cinema by the small door.
Realiser Lars von Trier chose to take Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will appear in two volumes (January 1 and 8 2014), is the erotic memories of a quadrennial increase in sex since its adolescence.
Stacy Martin's appearance with his age is striking: a brandille silhouette, a diaphane tent and French-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who did not hesitate to put anything on the glass paper will appear in more sulfate situations on a large screen.
A Nymphomaniac extract made the temperature mount on the Toile: Stacy Martin there appears in bed and is fully extended with Shia LaBeouf.
If the procurator had asked his actors to put their power on the plate, he had applied to X professionals for the most obese sex scenes, before fusion all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it was the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of putting his actors in their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A CGR room in Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Narbonne CGR Méga, as a precautionary measure, following picotations to the throat sensitive to the viewers.
Immediately, the director of the facility carried out the removal of the room and stopped the pumps for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people were out of the session.
The persons were examined and no full recognition of the room was given.
Mauvian plasantaria on the background of lacymogene jets?
Or an indiscriminate incident?
It is always that the director of the film played the principle of caution and security for its clients.
The room was rented and everything came in order.
The film was able to regain its rights and customers find the pleasure of the pictures.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into lemons
A woman who spent the day in Halloween tried to enter the country two kilograms of cocaine that were dissimulated in litres, Thursday morning, at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It is during the examination of the passengers' luggage that the drug could have been detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three citroids which had been previously seen.
The drug was then transported to Canada's Royal Gendarmerie (GRC) office, which took the initiative in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not find out where the woman arrived when she was interviewed.
That's part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Robby, an ASFC spokesman.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border officials at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have conducted 173 drug sessions, including 10 cocaine sessions for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border officials in the Quebec region conducted a total of 1653 drug-related meetings.
Air raids against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered the Lebanese airspace Wednesday at the beginning of the afternoon, but the raids took place in the evening.
A short-range SA-8-fly-air missile cargo would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new radius of Tsahal's flight in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to Israeli Haaretz) has not been confirmed either by Israel or by Syria.
The Raid took place in circumstances almost identical to the one on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American officer who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, referring this time to Yakhont's solo missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
The Israeli officials had not hidden their frustration at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forced President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches failure
The standard rating agency & Poor's dropped down Ukraine's solvency note on Friday, questioning the former Soviet republic's ability to meet its financial obligations for more than a year.
The note of public debt securities from the country goes to "B-", focusing on the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, with at least one chance on three that it will be again reduced from one year to another.
"It is less likely that the government strategy will provide sufficient foreign loans to meet its high external funding needs," the U.S. agency explains.
The agency notes that Ukraine's exchange reserves fell by 26 per cent between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This makes it difficult to reimburse credits abroad.
These reservations, to which the authorities have applied massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, which is based on the agency, are more likely to have a devaluation, which would reflect its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to manage its gas imports in Russia, which is accused of not paying a bill of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukraine in a period of tension with its Russian neighbor, angry about Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public on the following day of publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had risen between July and September in its fifth quarter of the contract.
It was also relatively modest in recent years and S&P was estimated at 33.5 per cent of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budgetary deficit, has been calling for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund for months, which has granted it $15.3 billion in 2010 and has blocked it for only 3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to provide any new savings until the country has adopted tax reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new infractional mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important external financing needs" were "a vulnerability", although relevant to "the economic improvement signs".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Centre for Political Studies, "a short-term improvement cannot be expected".
"There is little hope that impulsive reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," presidential elections were planned in 2015, with the expert interviewed by the AFP.
The only hope is to improve international cohesion.
S&P also refers to the "uncertainty" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels provides for the release of opposition Joulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but it could have a short and medium-term negative impact on Russia's response," S&P explained, fearing "commercial restrictions" on the part of Moscow.
Russia, which represents the fourth Ukrainian exports, has foreseen that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
Green U.S. at the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicists and Omnicom said on Friday that they had received no objection from the American authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first world advertising agency.
The merger draws closer to the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group have announced today the expiry of the period of review of the merger previously announced by the Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a communication.
They also state that they have received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the period of review provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several conditions for carrying out the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on the acquisition of other regulatory authorizations and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese army continues the M23 rebellions
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units would pass the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of the Northern Kivu border of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the point of being beaten after being evacuated from the northern Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC) that it has been monitoring since the beginning 20 months ago.
"We will continue the M23 and hide it everywhere because it is criminal," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman for the FARDC.
We must not let them reorganize themselves because they have been marrying the Congolese people for too long.
Time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the premises under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, had stated on the RFI that these military returns would not change its claims to the peace talks at all.
The latter, according to Ugandan media, re-entered Kampala between the Government of Kinshasa and M23.
Increases are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last location of the insurers' hands to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion saw the day in 2012.
Supporting them in November, the insurers occupied Goma, head of the province of Nord-Kivu, benefiting from the escape of the government branch and the passiveity of the blue cases of Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in RDC, the most important in the world in terms of efficiency, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC Major State has been rehabilitated and the army has passed into the offensive against M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to touch its end," announced a Congolese business expert Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historical - this would be the first time the Kinshasa government was able to overcome a major surprise.
This would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the RDC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which is not a threat to military support for M23, of being the starting point of several Congolese military leaders.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to give evidence of detention, announced a speech from the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had mentioned the possibility of military detentions following both falls in Rwandan territory.
Wednesday, the residents of Bunagana invaded the bourgeois streets to greet the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived for a year with the M23 and it seemed incredible to us to be a day free from the army," a resident of this border area of Uganda testified.
"We have lived in the land (from M23), we are traumatized," added the man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus have been found to be negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
It states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
Mardi, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of getting back from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease had already killed a hundred people.
Chevron, the second American oil company, was sold for a drop in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refinery margins, while its oil and gas production has increased steadily in relation to the group's objectives.
Its net profit of the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per operation, against $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per operation, a year in advance.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters were on average on a profit of $2.71.
The group produced 2,59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, with an increase of 2,52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected since 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment spending has increased from $7 billion in two years and should reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
The benefits of production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the benefits of the activities in the avalanche (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45 per cent to $380 million.
This reduction in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus, Chevron’s main competitors, Exxon Mobil, has been a bit of a net profit in low, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
Schooler transport: the complaint received
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has been demanding from the beginning of the school year the cost of 150 dollars per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from school transport to two residences, a service provided by the organisation when it is able to do so.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a media service proposed by the Commission and I was interested," said Mrs. Lefèvre.
According to it, the CSR was invited to a meditation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to compete and find solutions," Mrs. Lefèvre said.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-Dieu's emergency
He has been on the front line for several months by a party of staff and several unions, including CGT, Minister of Health Marisol Touraine, who decided on 10 July to "decalate the project's implementation schedule, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that would not be possible on 4 November".
An official application is made "to avoid any risk of taking emergency measures in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also intended not to generate the PS campaign for a few months in the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial consignees, the closure should also be effective at that date.
Even if the APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "continuity change".
As of November 4, the pumpers who ensured about a quarter of the 40,000 annual travel to the emergency of the Hotel-God will all be received to reduce 30 serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the interiors.
At the Hotel-Dieu, emergency-specialized interiors will leave a place on Monday to five interns of general medicine.
With regard to the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The Hotel-Dieu's emergency reception service has to be closed in the shortest time, and for us, it is November 4th," says Loíc Capron, President of the APHP Medical Committee, who supports the project of leadership.
"On November 4th, there will be no more patients with pumps, only people who come by their own means," confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency " , and he will be pleased to announce the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on the ground to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will stay in place, as well.
But it is for the ARS to decide to close the emergency reception service.
"The things are happening progressively," replied Nicolas Péju, the ARS spokesman for which, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service done."
"Minister lied to us or we lied to him," laments urgent physician Gerald Kierzek.
As a result of its role as head of the SMUR in July to lead the forward against the reorganization project, it is defined as a "synical" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They're in the process of seeing and reflecting the emergencies that were renewed less than five years ago," he said.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they're regular.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of emergency waiting for Lariboisière.
In the ARS, it is claimed that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent a "valanche" in other emergency services, where human resources will also be strengthened.
At ARS as at APHP, the "new hospital model" has already been on the way since 7 October and should continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
From the end of the year, liberal generalist doctors should also be involved in the establishment of a "permanent hospital care".
"Where are we going if people are asked to auto-diagnosing," asked Gerald Kierzek, for which "the concept of not serious urgency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will take place as for level 3.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care available.
If the Minister does not take measures this week, we will change the schedule, Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency doctor and a member of the Health CGT.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and will reflect on presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalia Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, counseling UMP of Paris and election of the 4th round, it is clear that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the emergencies at the Hotel-Godu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reverse them if they are returned to their responsibilities."
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, told her again Monday morning about France Inter that she had been sentenced to a moratorium for not closing on November 4th.
If that were the case, she'd notice her own misunderstanding, notes Bruno Juliet, her password.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot allow it without an acceptable means of bringing it to other hospitals.
Obama ends the hearings of the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to finalize its findings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its information activities, indicating an American, jujudian.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain its hand in the case of NASA's hearings after the discoveries made by former analyst Edward Snowden, refugees in Russia.
This is the first time mentioned by the Information Agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Questioned on the subject, an officer of the U.S. Administration replied: "The United States does not carry out electronic monitoring of the headquarters of the World Bank and IMF in Washington".
In expressing himself under the anonymity scheme, this officer did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be discontinued during the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at the same time that it ends at the hearings of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
In this context, the Senate Committee on Information approved a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has imposed new restrictions on the data that information agencies are authorised to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the preservation of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for combating poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in the development of the "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the MDGs, which will be held in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began to be held in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by the world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that it was now time to “overtake national interests”.
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and adapt to the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (ODD)," he added.
These ODDs will support the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I would do my utmost to meet the mandate I have been given by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that depend on the success of the MDGs.
The security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts between strong personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, during the tour, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director-general of an investment company.
Concerned about her country's future, she changed her work clothes against a tee-shirt saying "We want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on the site of the Jewish Capital Independence.
For two weeks, there has been virtually every day of reports of conflicts between the Government forces and the Renamo, the worst increases since the peace agreement signed over 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported by the White Government, then the Government of apartheid of South Africa in efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have highlighted foreign investors and the local population.
The survey is significant for the full-growth economy because the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal stocks in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion of investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko in the United States.
Frelimo, the party to power and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo has repeatedly rejected the responsibility of tensions.
The Renamo states that the Government is the source of recent attacks and has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional flood of the Renamo on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels were then triggered when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlaka, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The Government has made Renamo responsible for the outbreak of conflicts, and the charge of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said that the French press agency, the French press agency, would consider Mr. Dhlamaka as a "lost" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that the Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to meet the tensions that have been fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two big men (Guebuza and Dhlamaka) who do not stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, an open-source conference and a specialist in Mozambique.
No one knows how to negotiate and no one is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would take the municipal elections to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as a attempt to obtain concessions and a government-wide warship.
The share of the floods collected by the Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new part, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by an old member of the Renamo, should receive a greater number of suffering in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term of office next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want multiple democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has led to some disturbing attacks on police commissions and vehicles on a major North-South highway.
Most of the increases took place in the province of Sofala, which is located hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export the coal.
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway route for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was wrong when he was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things would not go well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations caused by the government, says Fernando Lima, Director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, many people are also concerned about corruption, the slowdown of development and the recent wave of eviction.
"People think that the future leaders of the country are the government and the president, and that the latter is the solution to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a manifesto, said that people wanted only stability.
"No one cares about the Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
It should teach mythes and legends to children as "models of lifestyle," says the author.
Thor's legend could show that "Bruth force does not make the weight of the subtile Russian," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "very violent, very scandalous and in some cases too obscenities to be taught at school", Crossley-Holland foretold a "minutely selection" of works adapted to age.
"I think it's amazing that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been asking for 20 years for this project.
He added that the fact that teachers and teachers are “openly educational ” makes children“ completely delineated, ” the messages are “sublimated ” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or done well, but there is a sense of good and evil.
And it must be highlighted; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The foundation knows what we're showing and what we're not saying.
A fighter from the Hamas armed branch was killed this night and another injured by an Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources were learned in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists carried out a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they were expelled from an Israeli blind spot.
NSA spying: the United States is "too far away", admits Kerry
The United States is sometimes "trap far" in the field of spying, acknowledged the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Polish case of Washington with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, disclosures and delays between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time an American government official explicitly admits the practices that have been disputed in the interception by NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I condemn it, as the President has done, some of these actions are too far away and we will ensure that this does not happen again in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London where he has participated since Washington on Thursday 31 October by video link.
In his renewed intervention, in the presence of British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified information and information collection practices by the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry ensured that the American authorities had since increased many projects of concern, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented planes from falling, the property does not explode and the people are murdered, because we were able to be on the run above these projects," the American diplomat argued.
And John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been misled."
But we strive to collect information.
"Yes, in some cases it has gone too far in an inappropriate way," the Secretary of State admitted, who had already expressed himself on this international scandal during a tournament last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday evening that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would be misled".
But the controversy between the Americans and the Europeans continued to influence this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, NASA was intercepting hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users data.
The paper, which quotes documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says that the program "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the British NGO homology, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by internet agents.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected during the last month - from metadata on e-mails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interferences would have taken place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have broken all ties with these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have been seriously intercepted by data and communications from United States allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European States and while refugees in the United States claimed that the American president was not listening to such a thing, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this issue, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the master of the strong NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of European citizens.
He even sent the ball to the European information services that would be received from these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these allies of the United States cooperate with the United States, and this would not mean Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the Polynesian was going to sell himself to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia called upon the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission was accused of being used by the Americans in the context of an extensive international spy network that also caused China's reputation.
The Paris Saint-German will receive Laurent Friday without his master's permission, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces League Club 1 in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the champion in front of Monaco in the range of goals, has published the list of players held for this 12th day match, without a 32-year-old attack.
The communiqué simply indicates that it is "damaged", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered a left knee inflammation when he returned from his selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of cremated losses
The Crematorium of Father Lachaise organises, at 11 a.m., a laique ceremony, in memory of all the cremated losses in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris Wall, must attend and then explain at a press conference on funeral proposals.

For their own obsessives, more than more than French choose cream, instead of inhumination: 53 per cent, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people instead of 47 per cent.
For the obsessives of a neighbor, this is the reverse: the French prefer inhumination (53% versus 47%).
If they are unhappy with losing a child, they are only 15% to choose the cream.
In his book The Death in Cendars, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and Vice-President of the National Health Ethics Committee, he stressed the "violence" that constitutes cremation for survivors.
There is, with the Cremation, "a violence committed to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a bag of ashes" in a very short time, not after a decomposition process, which "would accompany the stages of grief".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which includes "exacting the uniqueness and distinctive signs" reduced to "anonymity" of the bones.
Why is what is accepted without punishment in some Nordic and Protestant countries still bad in France?
"Because Cremation is a new fact," answered Marie-Frédérique Bacquí, president of the Tanathology Society and author of the book Apprivoise death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited its attempts to accept it.
Acknowledging the Cremation is for François Michaud-Nerard, Director-General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, provided for the loss of a ceremony as dignified as that for which he was entitled with inhumation.
The Ipsos annual survey shows a strong attachment to the ceremony's organization.
77 per cent of French people want one, for their neighbours, to be religious (53 per cent), or civil (24 per cent).
Today, 73 per cent of the people who have chosen a Cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums are adapted to this development of society.
"For a decade, they have been trying to avoid the violence of a waiter, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately following the release of the ashes," notes Mr. Michaud-Nerard.
70 per cent of the institutions now propose ceremony teachers, who, in the presence of the body, attend the following ritual: welcome the assembly, count the deceased, address the others, invoke it, give meaning to his death, organize the day.
This has been the case with the Crematorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
Ceremony teachers are often people who have become converts.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Crematorium of Father Lachaise has been held since the day of the Toussaint since 2010, in which he invites the families of the people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies was re-transmitted inline, in the interest of those who could not move.
Crematorium allowed us to relax.
In La Seyne, the rule for rats turns to Polish
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment in a red-cashed by the Furctidoor D2 furniture, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Land Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to register the couple and his three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reason" and the situation is blocked.
The case took outstanding proportions, I think Joël Capa, the director of the office.
There's always been rats in the cities.
The degrading company takes two steps a year, and in addition, we intervene, on our behalf, at every request of the inhabitants.
We have done so since the end of the last winter, 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats don't blow in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, degrading products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two minutes, no dogs will be killed.
"We didn't invite rats at our home," the father of the family who left his apartment to install himself at the hotel.
We are soon without sleep and are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo's Bourse is down to 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Forum ended on Friday in spite of good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The share suffered from the return of the dollar to the yen, which was harmful to the export values and the warning of its annual result launched by Sony Juudi.
Nikkei's index was 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix passed 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony lost more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house the flame projection in the Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday afternoon in the Old Quebec was quickly mastered.
More than 30 pumpers were spent on the 9th of Hebert Street.
The flames were announced in a three-room house located on four floors behind the Québec Seminar Court.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was managed an hour after the fires arrived, which were many to intervene.
As soon as our first pumpers arrived, they really saw the smoke appear.
"Then the alarm happened, because it took courage to attack the building, because it is built here," explained France Loiselle, a spokesman for Quebec's pumps.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the Valudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of ceremony teacher at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling lies directly to the public, about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it has been restored more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolinas stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of the head of the show rose to Carolinas, and they knew a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We have created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for former combatants organized in Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took over, like the world of comedy.
Many of the comedies participating in this year's festival were passed by non-traditional circuits, such as shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance at the front of the scene in a seatcom on a cabled chain ("The League" on the theme of the fantasy football happily left of the FXX chain) and now has his own show of chess on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is still more known for her violent video series "Marel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedys with a single voice (the surrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the Iranian advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the American comedy.
One of the main attractions of this year's festival will be entertainment: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedy, but he became a realist of the film and television, as well as an official story of the comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he launched a TV show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
You'll meet him at the Villa Hotel, in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comical DNA of all Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he went down a street between two furniture and said, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come back to live here."
The oil price continues to decline and is approaching $96 the barrel
Petroleum prices continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks account for a report showing that the Chinese mining sector is being strengthened by electricity.
The U.S. gross price for delivery in December fell from $14 per cent to $96.24 at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a drop of 5.8 per cent for the month of October.
The abundance of raw oil has weighed on the price over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy indicated Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector on Friday, which show increased activity, suggested an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to decline after growth increased by 7.8 per cent to the third quarter, after a decline that it had not been known for two decades to the previous quarter.
The gross Brent, a reference to the international gross already used by the American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 on the Inter-Contental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Reimbursement due to the right to inheritance in Texas
A federal court of appeal re-established in Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary interruption of pregnancy which had been blocked by a court of first instance this week.
This judgment means that a legislative text adopted in July in this State, which is largely due to the right to abrogation, will be able to enter into force.
The arrest made by the appeal court means that doctors who will practice IVG will have a "priority of admission" to local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, according to his status as a hospital nurse, to allow a patient in a hospital or medical centre to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
VIG defenders claim that the content of the law is likely to be translated by immediate closure of a third of the State's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privileges" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be almost 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these facilities.
Lundi, a judge of the first instance, had assessed the law on entry into force that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were anti-constitutional.
However, the Attorney-General of Texas, the Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the government's position, appealed to the court to cancel the first court ruling that blocked the application of the law.
A full hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has been able to return in force, on the side of the audience, with 1.3 million TV viewers behind their TV, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the show at your meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates were present at the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the cause of André Manukian and Olivier Bass.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the invitation to find their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first one.
As each year, the first audio outputs generate a wide selection of herb singers, for the best and sometimes for the worse.
But on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, some have found their accounts.
They are many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to be gone to the end.
Behind TV screens, successful vocals are always there, season after season.
Others have just the intention of laughing.
The court blocks a decision on NYPD's control and flag policy
A federal appeal court closed Thursday the decision of a judge requesting changes in the control and background programme of the New York Police Department and resolved the case.
The U.S. Appeal Court (second round) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the appeal was filed by the city.
The judge held in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and question citizens.
The city called for its conclusions and corrections, including a decision to appoint a controller to assist the police department in modifying its policy and training programme associated with it.
The appeal court heard arguments regarding the suspension request.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be determined by the file because it violated the Code of Conduct of the Judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of parity, partly because of a number of media and public statements in which it responded publicly to the court's criticisms.
The judge had found that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting black men and Spanish origin in their control and care programmes.
It has appointed an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cameras on the body in the areas where the largest number of controls occur.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of preserving the names and addresses of persons whose case was rejected after police control.
The hearing of the city's appeal should take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and noise have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and noise has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls, mainly relating to black and Spanish people.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and became a collective action.
The partners who make changes in the NYPD control and flagship programme say that they will end wrong practices, allow more effective police forces to be trusted, and can change the way police departments use politics.
The opposition said that these changes would reduce police morality without reducing crime, would represent money laundering and would not solve the wider problem of police force pressure after the police had been severely reduced in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the practices of control and fraud, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way NYPD had implemented its controls.
The tenants have to vote, as each of them pays $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes to the City.
When the owner pays $5000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each apartment.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us for $100,000 artificial fires, lands of $4 to $5 million for the case where...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the kitchen head of the Elysée
Entered into the 500 m2 elysian kitchens as a commission after working in ambasadas, the cook graved all the steps until becoming chief, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande by means of Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacations, and ate an incalculable number of great people in this world in a small anonymity that he currently only breaks at the time of retirement at 60 years.
The man in the open face, the crène degarni and intellectual moons, was born on October 24, 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is the title of a patriarch's CAP.
His mother was the same cook in a box in Sologne.
"I've gone from one cup to the other!" irony Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the ways of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also their husbands and some of their guests.
"He's always the head of the State or his partner or husband who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mma Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had forbidden women in the kitchens of Elysée!
He did not move to heads of State who showed relative indifference to earthly food, "they are all gourmans", says Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had certain "a little bit more developed."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the bags were empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "he doesn't have much more than he doesn't like."
The current Head of State, who restored the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, did not have "no specific regime application".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially in the days of the State in Elisetia: "between 200 and 250 people must be used in an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand there were errors.
The former chief of Elysée's kitchen, who took a glass of wine last night with his team, his family and friends, part with a penance in the heart." François Hollande came to greet me."
He said hilarious things.
" human beings are resourced," he says.
The head will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been on his side for 17 years in Ellisia.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the project of flame in the Vieux-Québec on Friday afternoon.
The furniture of four houses, located at 15th of the Hebert Street, has made three alarms to the fire service.
The fire was declared before, but it was raised on the three floors of the furniture.
France Voiselle, a spokesman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, stated that rapid fire-fighting has helped prevent the spread of flame to adjacent buildings, a challenge of size for the city's sector where buildings are built in a close manner.
The burned house opened four houses, but no tenant was located at the time of the fire.
The damages were all limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but the experts have distinguished the subject of a criminal act.
Le Loup de Wall Street: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets you get some pictures of his next film whose role, the role of an ambitious New York court, is taken by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will discover you in his role as a traitor.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Courtier in Long Island Bourse, who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in the context of a vast crime in Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then mounts a ship that will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible rise, but also the vertical fall that will follow.
Unlimited, man covers parties, women, drugs.
Dedication and excellence in all kinds are the master words of this folk story.
The Scorse-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The exit of the new Skorsese took the delay due to its mountain too long.
He'd look like the movie would last at 2h45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in justice at the race to the oscars.
Coulson used the phone pirate to check a tuyau
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephonic piratery, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a binding link involving the Minister of the Interior then in exercise, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false room in May 2005 according to which Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "good special advice".
He was notified to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaier, a private detective, to pry the Pawlby Vocal box and to "plant continuously at his door," but Coulson also called it and left him vocal messages.
"The charge suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the people's house waiting to surprise them, is the kind of person to like to present the story to people to see what they say," said Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate the subjects: telephony, surveillance and confrontation.
The Chief Editor is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that it is at the end of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what's the first thing?
Does he have knowledge of the telephony?
He argues against it, but we say, "Of course, yes."
The rummers on a link involving Clarke were first taken by the NotW editing office when a source, testing a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was sent to the house of Mulcaier in August 2006.
The investigators also found meetings on the computer of the private detective regarding Ms. Pawlby and his sister listed in a "Projects" folder.
During the period during which the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls for information on her, he added.
Meanwhile, the former reporter-in-chief Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have monitored the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's worst facts and management.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we are planning to publish tomorrow which I would really like to speak to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same scheme as other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard yesterday that Coulson had faced Mr. Blunkett on a relationship with a married woman while he himself had frequented the co-defencer Rebecca Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks did not design with others to dial phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted that they had made the telephone pyratage.
Barack Obama receives the first Iraqi Prime Minister, full of violence
The President of the United States had to receive on Friday, 1 November 2013, the first Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, in the United States' request for assistance in combating the worst wave of violence for five years.
Iraq became known in October as the most killer in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, 1 November.
964 people were killed in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher balance with 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violences are more and more deadly despite enhanced security measures and armed armed operations that have been launched for months by the Government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Shirts.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence is beginning to fear a new embezzlement, while the neighbouring Syria is in the process of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, museums, weddings and funerals.
Men are beaten in the street or even in their homes, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction with Sunny minority, under the authority of Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has contributed to this scourge of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the following day of the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars in northern Baghdad.
A good part of the violence was imposed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated in Al-Qaida (sunite extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of the United States of the first Minister Nouri Al Malaki who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on 12 December 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in the country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington, Nuri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the election of Congress.
Thursday, he asked that the international community conduct a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance in Iraq is supported by political and democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a poet, who attributed to him the partial responsibility for the repression of violence by his "sectary and authoritarian policy".
They also asked Barack Obama to understand in Nouri Al Maliki that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi Government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Pekin accuses a group of attackers from Tiananmen
The head of Chinese internal security accused a group of Xinjiang's oyster separatists of being behind the attention of the Pieded Car that had five deaths on the Tiananman site in the centre of Beijing, Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, focused on the people who were on the famous place of the Chinese capital, symbol of the death penalty in 1989, and took fire by killing three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Internal Security Policy Bureau, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkey of being an intensifier of this attack.
Many oyghurs, a Turkish-based minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkey.
In the case of the Chinese Government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that are triggered by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and preceded," said Meng at the Hong Kong TV channel Phoenix.
"The group held in college was the Islamic movement in eastern Turkey," he added, as his proposals were reviewed by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was of the origin of the egg and explained that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained filled containers of essence and a team with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident has caused 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement of East Turkey is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican seeks for contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey across the world on how parishes manage sensitive files such as contraception, divorce and couples formed by people of the same sex.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the ties of marriage.
The survey was sent to each national meeting of the bishops in mid-October, with the aim of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important meeting on the family that Pope François intends to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper of the United States.
A speech by the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in a proper manner to send the Parisians.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the Internet survey asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: the army attacks the last fief of the rebels
M23, or a few hundred combatants, were removed almost 2,000 metres high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunaga and Jomba, two locations located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of Nord-Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues in spite of the night," said AFP a resident of Jomba, connected by telephone to 12:30 a.m., and according to which a girl was injured by a ball in the morning.
"The intensity of the conflicts has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the RDC have replaced some of the rebels."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, soldiers had "passed through the night" in Jomba before mounting the front for a "ratification operation".
He had a very clear understanding of the food shortages of light weapons.
From Bunagana, political fief and the last strong place of the rebellion fell to Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonation.
According to a source to the United Nations Stabilization Mission, the battles were "in a final phase", the FARDCs "searched the remaining M23 positions for them".
Since the withdrawal, Friday, of conflicts between the Movement of 23 March (M23) and the army, Monusco has not directly participated in the wars, but has provided government troops with a strong support for information, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several tens of soldiers, well provided in ammunition, mounted on the front line.
They were armed with kalichnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the way to Bunaga, the post-frontier with Uganda, civilians assisted were carrying a multi-roquetted launch mounted on a train flying nine FADCs, to ensure the removal of another engine filling the M23 positions on the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, once again called for the rebellion to "demobilize voluntarily" under the threat of "force" but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without a result.
In place, the M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, there is no longer Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbal, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the Government.
The M23 was born in April 2012 of an old rebel, mainly tussi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which they reject in Kigali and Kampala.
Nord-Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the RDC, and its sub-sole provides abundant mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people were fled between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the movement of return to the RDC that was closed in the morning turned into mid-day.
"In the morning we went back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to repeat," said Imlinda Nyirankusi, surrounded by nine children, who were eating on the floor.
We have the impression that the sparks are approaching the peoples.
Early in the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a matlas on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
Musical comedy, this scene drink
Classics, sophisticated, popular, English or French, canned and dance productions take their place.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the music in French claims to be a sort of success.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the opera rock, most of the attempts were in vain.
And the successful men like Cabaret or the Misérables carried the aureole of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Châttelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador has changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes keep titles like successful tubes.
The first rehearsal, this Christmas, is my Fair Lady and announces for the following world creation of "A American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Belle and the Bed" could well be one of the success of the season.
On other scenes, music shows such as "1789", "Bastille Amants" and small musical comedys such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are devoted to the range of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Musical Comedy History" and conference at the Theater of the Châttelet, analyzes the reasons for success if it is lastingly achieved.
How does French music come about?
The offer has been multiplied.
There are first the "musical shows" that evolve in the audience of producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true history such as in 1789, the Amants of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year-old bond that we can serve almost anywhere when Matt Pokoro is in the head of the show.
Then there are musical comedies with the suspicious productions of the Châttelet that bring us back to Broadway's golden age and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes English-Saxon musical comedys of diversity by adapting them to French.
Independent French producers try to make a profit.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of the Aragnized Women" or "The Prince's Eve" have a bad effect on being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway to sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight music shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talent artists turning projects into projects.
In the United States, music comedy is very different.
Young people are trained for these measurements in many schools.
The jobs are many among the regional theatres, tournaments, Broadway, the off-road...
The life of talent is also the result of the number of posts to be able.
Why have the villagers in the province been so successful?
Apart from the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
There are lots of theatres going on tour, and it is often the boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Musical shows make up this lack.
These are the same young people who love telemetry and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering beautiful young men (often talented) in the head of a musical show is the insurance of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are clearly kept by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very waiting when they arrive in a Zenith province.
The Mayonnaise is located in Paris and enjoyed by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms in France in the same way as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels line
A road accident caused a serious injury, on Friday morning at 5:30 a.m., on the internal line of Brussels, up to Hoeilaart, heading to Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who was punished.
The ring was closed at 9 a.m. in place of the accident, the time the road is deflated and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation has not been properly caused by the accident at the height of Hoeilaart's exit.
The movement could then be triggered by this output/injection of the ring.
A child severely injured in an attraction to Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old was severely injured after an accident on an attraction to Disneyland Paris.
Its vital forecast is no longer engaged but it is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Pirates des Caraibes".
She was closed to the new order.
RDC: The Army is preparing a new attack
Children play on a carbonic cloud belonging to M23 rebels in Kibumba on 31 October 2013, in the east of the RDC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack against the latest M23 rebellions near Bunaga, in the east of the RDC.
The objective is to allocate the M23 of the hills that populate Bunaga.
Yesterday, we took the Bugina Colline, which is covering the Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from itself.
He'll be more than Runyonynyi's college.
"Celle de Chanzu is not very strategic," the North Kivu Governor, Julien Paluku, told the AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
This place is located at the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was captured by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Since then, a few hundred of M23's irreductives have been removed almost 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and nearby Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had fought all nearby Thursday all day said that the situation had been "sustained from this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by security forces and buried.
A girl was injured by a bullet, and three others were injured, including a robbery, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness mentioned by the AFP.
Since the resume of the wars between the FARDC and the rebellion on 25 October, the two Belgians have given no balance to the loss of human life.
NASA's revelations increase the paranoia of companies with regard to State surveillance
By a beautiful end of August, a German police helicopter had largely exceeded the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the order of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office (BfV), the German National Information Agency, its mission was to photograph the U.S. pre-post tower, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that BfV is expected to identify the presence of listening ears and that the operation has caused an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of American Information Services, once again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capacity to "volve the industrial secrets of foreign companies for the account of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their benefits".
However, since Edward Snowden, the consultant has become a disclaimer, he has begun to reveal his infamous treasure of information on the secrets of the United States surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know if he should believe in word.
Reports show that the National Security Agency of the United States inspired the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by US storage service providers in Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, had more than ever caused the parallelism of companies with regard to State surveillance.
The discovery that the German Chancellor's telephone Angela Merkel had been pirated, perhaps even for a decade, was the taste of water that made the wax depleted.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between American information services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is reasonable that these data should be used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, BITMI president, representing the German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States poses such an important risk as that of China when it comes to industrial and flight data, according to an investigation published in July by the EY Board of Directors.
However, in all documents published by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Political men have been concerned about the fact that the EU does not have sufficient information and the Internet and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German parliament member said we should create a German Google.
I can't just close my eyes and slowly rub them...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of German company software company SAP.
If a strong European IT industry was to be desired, then it was not necessary to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
All except the IT industry.
However, the expansion and sophistication of American spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations was a shock for some companies that thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is due to the fact that European officials have been aware of the fact that data stored in the United States are regulated under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-American members refused to use a U.S. storage service provider in the cloud after disclosures on the American Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our customers today ask us a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data should therefore be kept at all prices.
It is not surprising that there is economic tension.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring subject for many years and nothing has substantially changed in the context of the current discussion," said Kurt Bock, Director-General of the BASF Chemicals Company.
The Americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally less inclined to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, where this would leave the advantage to an enemy.
Large companies have long testified to the message that it is most unwise to recover a free USB key in a professional living room or to leave a laptop without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the sound car manufacturer's board of administration, says that the collection of portable phones before the Council meetings, so that they can't be used as remote hearing devices, is a practice that has been ongoing for years.
Germany's BfV advised its leaders to consider using simple portable phones prepared when travelling abroad because of the risk of access to the integrity of smartphones.
The mobile phones are then turned off.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their own brand.
"SMEs often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access," warns BfV in a report.
The United States warns its own companies about economic spying activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, as co-operated in the second degree of economic information punitive acts in the background of China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of a renowned German company considered that when it comes to economic spying, "Frenchs are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal information, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, expose their alliances."
The parents of a teenage in Georgia, who has died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son has been murdered
The parents of a teenage in Georgia, whose body was found in a ruddy battle tape in the gymnasium of her lyce, think their son was murdered, declared the lawyer of the Jewish family.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a supported tape behind the stairs of his lycian gymnasium.
The investigators of the Chief of the London Board concluded that Johnson had died in unsolved circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family rejected those conclusions.
"They are absolutely some who have been killed by their son," said Benjamin Crump, counseling representative Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff.
“ They think it’s all a logical challenge, the laws of physics and the common sense, ” adds Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered to the sole purpose of covering the death of their children or persons responsible for the death of their children.
"They sent their children to school with a cardboard and we put them in a dead bag," he added.
U.S. Prosecutor Michael Moore stated yesterday that he was conducting an official investigation on Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore expressed himself at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll give you the facts where they're going.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis for opening an official investigation," he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was destroyed by "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he put natural elements in order to justify a civilian or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to proceed.
The representative of the sheriff's office in the county of London was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to submit all video surveillance records that were examined by the investigators.
The parents of the teenager said that they expected video images to contain clues about the circumstances of her death.
The CDC publishes advice on allergies in children for schools
Mercredi, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage the food allergies of children at school.
This is the first set of guidelines published by the American Government, as the number of children in school suffering from food allergies has been severely severe.
A 20-year-old in the United States today suffers from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in the child increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of the educational body and the food allergy in the child, and on how to treat them in case of allergic reactions.
It also recommends schools to have an epinephrine stock – the epiPen self-injector being the most closely used – in order to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative meetings of the States have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily than epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something touches my tongue," "I have the impression of having a hair on my tongue" or "I have pictograms on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of discussion on information
How do you explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is publicly challenged by calling the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the crossing of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the room of his presence on his board by Edward Snowden?
I think there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When François Hollande telephoned Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius calls the US ambassador, they respond to a true discovery, which is that of the extent of the American surveillance of all communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the world's columns a few weeks between the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the hearings of the Quai d'Orsay by NASA?
Wouldn't it be like a hypocrisy vague on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for interest and the relevance of information that allows every citizen to lose his opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the road to analysis by American political innovation diplomats or others worldwide, we consider that this is an important clarification with regard to American power.
When we describe American interceptive systems in the face of French diplomacy in the United States, it is no case for us to reject this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did France receive information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we get rid of American cooperation?
The implementation of highly powerful technological interceptive tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified in the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States have, in particular, established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and described as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah has been notified to the French through the NSA.
France can be conducted, for example, to transfer entire data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, on the contrary, it has already been said quickly - the Americans can provide information to French in other regions of the world.
It is therefore not the capacity or right of the countries to have the right to intervene, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, in particular within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter to be theirs, and, finally, the question of freedoms.
What are the United States really at risk? A degradation of their image?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk posed by the Americans can be doubled.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest level of their State, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States were held.
Another effect can be more economic: more and more European or South American companies require, in the light of discoveries, their confidential data to American suppliers submitted to American laws, and therefore to NSA.
Last element: the broad movement of revelations committed by the media of the whole world, which contributes to a debate on the monitoring practices of information services so far, could lead legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their information services.
Parents of intersexed children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognise a third sex for newborns with both sex organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be attributed to them in a strict manner to birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer have to declare their child’s sex, allowing them to enter a “indeterminate ” or “not specified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make informed decisions on a sexual reassignment surgery for their food, and to combat discrimination against persons involved.
According to the BBC, a person who was sexually involved would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I will remain the patchwork that doctors have created, contusioned and balafré.
It is estimated that a child of 2,000 born each year is neither a boy nor a daughter.
They are intersexual, part of the group of 60 disease-diagnosed diseases such as disorders of sexual development, a generic term describing persons with atypical chromosomes or gonades (ovarians or testiculars) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been sexually abused.
Sexual identification is not always well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to assign it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if appropriate.
Dr. Jack Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Drescher, a New York Psychologist and sexual identity specialist, said that the new German law “sees to be a good idea”.
Intersexual children have an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual appointment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
Science that consists of how a child develops a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described persons involved as different from transsexual or transgenic persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively that of a man or that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can be shown by themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, pilosity, poitrine and station), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination against persons who were intersex and transgenic in employment, as well as the scope of acts of arrest and violence and crimes motivated by victims.
Young non-compliance boys now have fields that are specifically intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to sign male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neuter" after having obtained his appeal trial that allowed him to keep a "non-specific" sex alive.
German passports will carry a third designation by M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always the subject of controversy, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in that country originally signed a petition to remove the “generous theory” from school books.
The American Catholic Online website also opposed the German law, writing that "because the world is brought into a new rule where gender is a choice, but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are turned away."
In Maryland, a nurse's mother also said about Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be given to babies at birth.
“The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without further restrictions, especially if you do not know your child’s sex,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodite, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And for a decade, the medical community would consider the kind of ardoise, that it can be removed and on which it can be redesigned.
But now, many are those who repeat the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that doctors may sometimes get tired, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual resuscitation when he grows up.
“ In the mid - 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children born of ambiguity was launched by Dr. John Money, of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be undesirable.
He used the term “sexual identity” and supported that social and environmental signs – how parents learn a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to make it known as male or female sex.
But in one case of 1966, known as "John/John", his theories have given rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut off during a forced circumcision to throw it away completely, also removing the witnesses, and raising him as a daughter.
"Money presented it as a successful transition case, but it wasn't the case," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he became a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he killed himself.
Drescher said that some doctors “keep repeating this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say, "they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male male XY chromosomes but with ambiguity sexual organs.
Doctors couldn't really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical breakdown of the external body and the testicles and was raised as a daughter.
He was treated with female hormones at 12 years of age.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he had a vaginal disease.
But depressed and aware that something was wrong, he asked his medical file.
What he discovered scared him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to allow his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man, following treatment at the testosterone and was removed from his heart.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which seeks to normalize the perception of persons involved.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director general of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Reported Choice, fearing that the German law "encourages labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their children a "indeterminate" sex," she said.
We were afraid that it would encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third gender call."
" Adults should be able to make their own decisions on a legal nature," she added.
The German law relates to sex at birth.
It's not a battle for young children to go to that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in the mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development that helps thousands of people in a support group, stated that the German law “responses” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called a complete insensitivity syndrome in the Androgens.
Due to the failure of her Androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but not a uterine or ovaries.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and has an internal childhood psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is a star, she hopes to have children through adoption services or pregnant mothers.
"The law leaves some flexibility to parents so that they do not make critical decisions," Baratz said.
This allows them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time before they enter "male" or "female".
So everything's fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a great baby and enjoy being a parent.
You do not have to anticipate surgery that is irreversible.
"This puts the children in the heart of the decision and gives them the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what is necessary," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that is something that is formidable.
This allows the child to decide for himself.
Letter trusting in the longevity of its Government
The President of the Italian Council, Enrico Letta, decides that his Government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right of the coalition within the power to reach the Senate's vote in favour of his mandate, Silvio Berlusconi.
In a daily interview La Stampa, the head of the left-hand centre said to "strengthen the intention" to continue to rule with its coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The upper room of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council condemned for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more enemies than MPs, declares his disappearance.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People's Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as he demonstrated his refusal to surrender to the injections of Berlusconi, who had already wanted to break the cabinet.
L.A. Times reported that an agent of the American Transport Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fires.
In response to a call made by "many injured" were said to have been made by bombers called on the scene.
"The forces of order are on the ground," explains the airport on his Twitter account, while the images of television show people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a fusion," said AFP a spokesman from the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA).
ABC's local advance will show an evacuated person on a brand, and a second transported on a rolling stock.
The incident took place at 9 a.m. (12.30 a.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times indicate that the themes 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA's password was not able to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills a member of Hamas in Gaza-sces
Israeli warplanes killed an Islamic Palestinian soldier in Hamas and severely injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, after sources of health services were learned.
A source out of Hamas explained that fighting in this region had spread out, as Israeli war had broken out the border and had been watched by the shootings of Palestinian deaths.
The Israeli army was pleased to launch a "targeted action" in the area near a qualified tunnel of "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, across the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: The Obama campaign considered to be leaving Biden to fall for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers of President Barack Obama considered, in the most secret, to replace Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most remarkable event that appears in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Dubble Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book to appear and told Thursday evening that the next president's colleagues had done "deep work in groups and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's escape could help Obama to re-election while his hopes were falling.
According to the relevant policy of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the High Commissioners of the campaign and of the House-Blanche, namely the former Secretary-General of the House-Blanche Bill Daley, to measure the effect of replacing the vice-president with the former Secretary-General of Clinton.
The possibility of exchange is a secret that has been carefully stored within the Chicago campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only one-hundred-and-a-half of the Vice-Presidents – including Daley, Obama's former campaign leader Jim Messina, and the former advisers at the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was in the study.
"Dubble Down" indicates that Daley carried the load to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not improve the chances of Obama's success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I said I had examined a series of questions, and it was one of them," said Daley in the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the president was not in the shape, and we said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified for the "concert" review, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the reelection campaign had invested much to find out if the change would be beneficial during the survey.
"The campaigns do not spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking measures," said Martin on AC360.
However, we do not know whether Obama was in charge of the replacement of his team.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was at the time of the possible recovery.
Although Daley said he did not think that the President "had been at the root" of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that he was "possible" that Obama had.
Martin added that "Dubble Down" did not definitively answer the question of whether political investigations had occurred at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's absence from the presidential list had been examined.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
Did you want a fluffy glass?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on medicine.
Charlie Francis took part in the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a light collating.
It was the idea after reading a study on drugs and convinced Chinese scientists to use the brilliant protein chemically.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing protein pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that, because the ice cream starts to cry when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it gets lighter, it gets brighter.
Charlie, founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said, "It's something incredible, but we still have only the beginnings in terms of production, and 2 g of this trick costs about 200 £."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the language to neutral pH.
So when your mouth absorbs protein, the pH increases and the ice is lit.
We tested it in recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives a wonderful effect.
It's probably the sweetest ice I've ever created because the light of the drugs is worth four times the gold.
So each hole costs me about $140.
But she's good at it!
The company at Charlie's experimental stage, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice perfumes such as beer, cheese, butter and gold sheet.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
It is extremely impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the medicine that are synthesised by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tat chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while he was practicing thai chi, revealed his wife, Laurie Anderson, in a letter published by the Regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died early in the morning, while he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st move of tai chi, with his hands of musicians who were blowing the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master of thi chi, a Chinese martial art.
The husband of the singer also explains that she promised her husband the week before her death to get him out of the hospital and to take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have been here a long time in recent years.
And even if we're citizens, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a warrior, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will give many people the wonderful joy of living," she added.
Lou Reed's had a fever last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat bunnies, go to bed late and get us to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I'm becoming more hunger.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed one good and I wouldn't do it any more this year.
But the states show that I'm the cool dog when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million among them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 MD in benefits, discounts and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I expect with patience at every Halloween party is the trends.
The discounts should represent $1.2 MD on the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the unanimized sex objects become hot.
Women no longer need to be sex professionals; they can also be sex foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I look forward to seeing many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I feel that the men in Daft Punk space will be among our photos Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most researched wastes are zombies, Batman, pirates and sorrows.
I guess it's okay to stay traditional.
We took our dogs off last year and, to my great surprise, they were not alone.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 M in livestock waste this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs thrown in hot dogs.
When it's good, we're not hungry.
The Americans will spend $1.9 MD in charity this year, according to the Nielsen Cabinet.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, successors, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for 41 million children who go to the stock market in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we don't tell history, spend 41 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The bunnies are the only thing we don't want to eat; however, almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
It represents about 9 billion maize grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to elucidate yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 well-known well-known houses in the United States, which generate about 500 MM of recipes, according to the America Hunts, and this includes these beautiful photos of you as you put on your friend's Facebook and that you can't remove and on which type you really like to leave a comment on the "good head".
Finally, we're talking about lemons.
Charlie Brown presented us La Grosse Citrouille when we were raised, and sculptured a lemon in the form of a lanter, it's like drawing a Christmas tree – it's something we've done since we've been small.
Fortunately for us, "the tendency of the baby-citrouille" has begun only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have sculptured these powers and have not been able to assist themselves.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 M in citroids, according to U.S. Census Bureau.
The Lanternal Citrus who gently floated on your home's pig probably came from Illinois, where 542 million lemons were grown this year.
If you are trying to notice more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to draw their 922 kg citruule.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal deficit structure ("bad bank") consisting of 38 billion books (EUR 45 billion) of the most likely assets, a measure designed to shut down its relations with London and to accelerate its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of the suspects in its balance sheet in the coming two years and hopes that they will be completely cleared in the three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for the appreciation of additional doubtes of four to 4.5 billion books on the quarter, a writing on the construction of the canton structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free 10 to 11 billion capital books, thus strengthening its ability to borrow.
The Bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would allow a treaty on the past, and the government in particular had been accused of engaging in RBS management.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a big bank for the client and the United Kingdom," said the new Director General Ross McEwan at the press.
Land Rover announces his sponsorship of a series of rales
The interior has a 6-point seat and a 6-point parking lot, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options are improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director General of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rallyers who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and a realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such a partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different types of rabies in the United Kingdom and the international, and to prepare for the rich and the realities of rabies.
We had a great pleasure to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle – the champion will be really palpating.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the possibility of participating in events in the North and Middle East African deserts.
The pumpers were called to rescue a lost shutt after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable corner in a career
Ruby, a cocker Spaniard, was evicted after an accident on the road without gravity
She was reported three days later by a person who walked her dog in the career.
The pumpers have come down to remember the length of the falase to recover the dog and save from a certain death
A castle had the chance to escape to the worse after the pumpers were called to recover it safely while it was buried at 15 m above the ground on the unstable floor of a falase.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cooker, escaped after an accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days only before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to the Flappit career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Support Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social networking sites after she disappeared in the career following an accident without gravity.
At 7:15 a.m., a person on the right-hand side of his dog was represented by Ruby on a corner in the career, 15 metres above the ground.
A technical support team from the Cleckheaton pumper casserole ran on the premises and was recalled to save Ruby by using an animal vehicle to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Technical assistance specialist Andy Clayton stated: "It was in a pre-existing situation."
She was in the middle of the hall, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
She was absolutely not bled during the rescue – she was mad.
But she's going well now.
She ate biscuits after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's incredible that someone noticed the dog.
The technical assistance specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby has had a lot of chance of getting revenge."
She could have been seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for control; her general status was satisfactory, including the espionage and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified to observe the aid."
At first, I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him again in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and that she had woken up, she would probably have fallen.
The pumps have been exaggerating.
What they did was very brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely formidable.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid she fell but she didn't move."
The pumps were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mike Jagger says he never loved Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio broadcast this week, the pop star said she was running on Jagger's "Old Habits Die Hard" song in 2004.
Perry said he had eaten with the rock vetter and explained, "he took me away when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very kind."
In a Jewish statement, 70-year-old Jagger said that he "did not make any progress in Katy Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she's confused with someone else."
Perry was one of the songs to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", appeared in the first place of the cards this week.
Pékin causes a Turkmen Islamic movement
"The support in the coalition has come from the Islamic Movement of East Turkey based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese security bodies' pattern on a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on Thursday evening on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the political office of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), visited Tachkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese officer appoints a special organization after Monday's arrival.
According to the Chinese police, three Ouijhours of the same Muslim dominant family in the Xinjiang region, bordered by several Central Asian countries, had planned their car loaded with heavy goods against the entry of the banned City to Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and injured 40 people.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of Eastern Turkey, former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations associated with Al-Qaïda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic problems in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's Eclination Makes the Choice of Ecossais · Global Voices
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are expected that an independent Econox should join the European free movement zone in order to be able to join the EU.
And here's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbeled children along the Wall of Hadrian.
If it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper has indicated the possible economic disadvantages of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this would not be reflected in the great titles (and this would be expected).
No one has said that EU Member States spend much of their time around their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, a non-performing non-compliance with the rules would be a false concession that Brussels could offer against anything it would like to obtain from Scotland.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" over 40 years ago.
However, an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old press account.
Why should an independent ecosystem follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange London's gambling against Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real reality about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Through Europe, parties who oppose the EU or who fight for the adoption of the euro as a common currency are winning from the ground.
Even in Germany, the alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and reached no more than five million votes in the federal elections in September and came out of the Liberal Party (equivalent to our liberals-democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the draft creation of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis marked a turnout.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the weighting of national economies through accession to the single currency, led many people to think that the European Project was too far away.
The euro crisis did not have a great deal to see with the national governments that record excessive budgetary deficits – that was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has put pressure on its members on exchange rates favourable to German exporters – what German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of a devalued national divide, the countries of southern Europe are facing an internal productivity problem in Germany.
The only appeal is to make cuts in public salaries and expenses – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the 'green' energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for the subsidies of French and German energy companies on consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas as the United States.
It is an inconsistencies in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's salt gels will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by a well-marketed American skiing gas.
As a result, the revolution, in particular in France, is one of the major EU leaders.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a means of controlling Germany and placing Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needed Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to go wrong.
As a result, the right-hand side of Marine Le Pen, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial partial election, bringing socialists to the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular part in France with 24% of the outbreaks – an appropriate warning for the British Labour Party, which reminds him that it cannot be based on the principle that a division of the right will automatically favor the right.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity at the French white working class?
It wants to use European elections next year to create a single and anti-European anti-monetary block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are well represented in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could be controlled by the European Parliament for the first time.
That's what I think: very soon, the single European anti-European and anti-Money feeling will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will be more similar to the "European of the Nations (Sovereign)"-free privileged by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could save the euro, but France and southern Europe will find their own currency.
I look forward to the United Kingdom taking its distance from this project, and I hope that it will make the United States soft eyes.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific leaves the impression that Britain will be left to account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a small region of England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could be satisfied with a more free European agreement on the condition that we keep our own debt.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and preserve our economic independence.
The Government of Scotland is – and is to say – the anti-austerity political movement that has the best success in Europe, as it has won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed shadow cuts (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Party, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/democratic coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it was to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Faster
Studies show that young girls in Africa and Spain tend to reach the age of puberty more quickly than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity could be an outbreak of early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
The former CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and health issues in the child.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's breasts and breasts begin to grow at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics that took place this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, feet-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time comforting parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid change to full puberty,” said Kaplowitz.
The evident signs of development, such as breast-feeding, arms and in the public area and body ovaries, appear more rapidly in girls.
But there has been only a slight increase in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, while it was 12 and three fourths in 1970.
“ Once the poitrine has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear, ” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem”.
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will develop.
There is a debate on what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered to be “precise” when the development of poitrine is accompanied by a Sudanese growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, slow or stopped development – it is something that a pedagogue can follow.
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by endocrinologists to remove serious problems such as tumors or coughs.
There are treatments to delay the existence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: early ageing of the os that can hinder growth and a small size of adult age.
Recommendations on medical and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the development rate, the rate of growth and the impact of age.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medications but recognizes that “the control of puberty can lead to some behavioral and emotional problems for young girls to be different from others.”
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they will handle health issues," Kaplowitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose first ten - year - old daughter had her own rules.
Even if there were signs and we were talking about rules, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came back from the frozen school and was troubled to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages carried by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their popularity sooner.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is the epidemic of obesity.
He participated in a study of 6-9-year-old girls, which placed the percentage of fat in the decline of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In that country, young African and Spanish girls tend to reach the age of puberty sooner than white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by all, economic conditions in the climate, passing through genes.
Another problem: Although boys had eyeglasses and in the younger public area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced in girls as well.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of the acne and the public pools is current, even in the food and the pets.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice on how to communicate with their children.
“ This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned, ” Kaplowitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will respond in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that even when this happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.
Humanity to the People of the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Coen's brothers, the Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and playful film on the Greenwich village in 1961 and folk music that started to resonate before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose film came to be a retrospective in French cinema, had highlighted the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In default of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their revolution on the American movie star, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs interpreted directly, Oscar Isaac reveals a musician and singer of people accomplished, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich neighborhood in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less loud clothing, a sweet voice when she sings, but the jury owes to the mystery when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about the suffering of a folk singer who doesn't get to walk and walk around the whole earth for a week.
He accepts the replacements to the feet raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documenter's air
"His relationship with success has been tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of evil, a boy who is not at the right time, who is not a careerist but integrates, with a self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen, co-founded with his brother Joel of several Oscars and price in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two folk music fans built their history on real characters of the time like the people of Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the arrival of Greenwich village, this New York district called to be "the showcase of popular music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film is then taken from documentary halls, of the 33T-invasion pussier music label, built by an infamous old secretary, to the musical choices of contemporary studios and to the cafés where the singers were produced.
Brother Coen's magic still works by incorporating a personality role that goes through the film constantly: a great red chat with a crazy look, a lucky companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked how he composed his personality, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had remembered having "great in Tennessee, beaten by blues and country".
"My first musical lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to "be considered good", "hasard can also launch the career of someone", and "more and more today".
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let go of everything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gerard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He would never have known the word quoted.
The French edition phenomenon, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83 years of age, was quite right to publish its 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times designated it as "the author of spying novels who knew it too much."
He then spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theater of 198 and 199 of the famous series of spying novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved on this trip with a decombatant.
And before Afghanistan, it was also divided into Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gerard de Villiers, born in Paris on 8 December 1929, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost a half century ago.
"There is no doubt between 120 million and 150 million people in all countries," he said last March.
His birman's chat on the knees, in the hall of his huge apartment of the Foch Avenue at two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he mentioned some of the languages in which SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, drawing a stack of books on the bottom table between the bronzes or the irrigated ires of 130 countries in the Argentinian countries to place their novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman in the prosperous poitrine, carrying a gun or a rifle.
In the inside, his senior Serenism (SAS) is Princess Malko Linge, Austrian aristocratic and aristocratic agent of the CIA to pay for the repair of the family's castle, he leaves the ruins of all the earth's evils, communistes of the 70s and 80s, then juhadists from the 90s.
At each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exotism, some hard sex scenes, a set of violence and torture.
"I never claimed to be a literary author," explained Gerard de Villeers.
I think I'm a writer who writes to distract people I don't send messages to.
He worked "like the great reporters before the war, of the Albert London type, who went on the spot and returned with real and long investigations."
SAS's father said "make a kind of geopolitical booklet".
"I'm still my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," said Gérard de Villeers.
On the ground, I meet journalists, including those from the AFP, diplomats, people of the services I have known for some 20 or 30 years.
On the other hand, many of its SASs are often premonmonautious: so, a month before the attack of a Syrian control centre that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damas".
In the "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to discover the existence of a CIA secret command centre in this city, Berceau of the Libyan Revolution.
In 1980, he recorded the murder of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Complot du Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the 4X4 Jihadista columns based on the Malian capital.
I'm not going back, Gerard de Villiers was defending himself, I'm just doing hypotheses from countries I know well and, in time, some of my hypotheses are happening.
After these trips in troubled areas, he was installed within a month of his machine to write IBM to Marguerite since 1976 "with all the parts were changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in style.
At the walls of his office are reinforced with AK-47 assault rifles, erotic pictures and photographs of the author with African warlords.
On a regular basis for machinism by feminist links and racism by human rights organizations, Gerard de Villeers dismissed these charges in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I've always been very welcome in Africa where I count on a lot of readers.
Gerard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He won't die and he won't come back.
No more than me.
Airplanes are interested in the width of the seats while large orders are in play
The dispute is among the major aircraft manufacturers about the length of the tourist class's seats on long-run flights, opening the way to a wider confrontation at the Dubai airport that took place this month.
The conflict concerns the range of seats proposed on long-line flights to the passengers of the economic class – which are not always the shortest by air companies, but which are the key to increasing efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the Aeronautics industry to put in place a standard that imposes a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that this should be the airline's decision.
The difference was widened when aircraft were seeking to sell even larger versions of their long-range motor vehicles, hoping for a record of orders in the event that would take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be available behind the plane – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that his revised "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 persons in 18 large-scale seats in nine rows.
Aeronautic genes often exchange cuts on technical issues by making advertising available in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Aeronautics Hall, where 777X should take over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently been able to consider what could be the start of a new advertising war with the presentation of a picture of three people showing each other at the restaurant, entitled “Do you accept this?.”
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in quieter seats than in regional turbo propellers," said John Leahy, the commercial director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but the seats in the aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined the modern long-line journey, and around the century, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health data.
The average American tour of the twenty-first century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival has grown to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the conference of the newly baptized "jet set" was more narrow.
Airbus adds that it ordered a study indicating that an additional drop in the width of the seats would improve the quality of the 53 per cent summary.
Boeing contradicts Airbus' figures with regard to the width of the seats and claims that this is not for manufacturers to decide how air carriers balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study showed that cabin experience does not depend solely on the width of the seats.
“It is really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they should do to carry out their activities well,” said Kent Craver, in charge of the satisfaction of passengers at Boeing.
They don't want us to tell them what they'll be able to do.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more important to have some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, there is more than one question that could affect their results.
After the debate, there is a course for air orders for an estimated amount of at least $700 Md at market price in the coming decades, enough to think about the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the setting of seats is exactly what feeds the battle between all the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both earn a seating performance in their latest long-run motor models more than 20 % higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model configured in rows 9.
The unit costs gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seating currently in service.
"Boeing does this in order to be able to rent more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, director of Comfort Passager at the European Airbus Airport.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggests that many passengers are in favour of a more denser configuration, which can be compared with less expensive rates.
"A width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the fact is that, from a commercial point of view, the proposal of Airbus is motivated by the threat of 777," said Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but they offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines should choose.
The aircraft vendors who are traveling the world even carry with them a meter to check the competition configurations.
While waiting to offer comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer planes with high density configurations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that he hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater passengerization of cabins by offering larger seats on some of his planes.
Without the support of another major manufacturer of large modern equipment, the experts say that it is unlikely that its call to the Aeronautics industry to establish a standard of size for busy seats, but that it could forget the volume of sales of 777X.
Oracle shareholders hated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle's shareholders voted against the proposed remuneration for the founder and Director General Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but it has come to have the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune of all just aureolated by the victory of his boat at the Gulf of America.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had voted against her remuneration.
The Oracle's boss cancelled a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 year in May due to the poor performance of the group, which had lost its growth goals, but he found about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
At the end of the 2013 season, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5%, while Bourse's Bourse course was 27.5%, exceeding the S&P-500 index, which took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicin vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the lives of nicotinic dependents.
Other tests are necessary before the test on human beings begins, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College of New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exposing all the methods now available on the market, but discover that their addition is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an indefensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus is selectively infected with liver cells, which then starts producing a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodys track all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoke from having its nicotine dose.
In the trials, the vaccines then administered to nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the rats who had not been vaccinated "were in love" told the researchers that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous vaccines against tobacco have become ineffective because they contain antibodies.
The injections should be repeated so frequently that the antibodies levels remain too high that they were too honorable and little practice.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future human use vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addition to nicotine.
But it is more likely that it is used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again, they will not take any pleasure because of the anti-nicin vaccine, and this will help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists stated that the results were interesting but indicated that much deeper research was needed.
The head of Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an attack by an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times since.
However, those responsible for the information, the army and the activeist movement have stated this time that he had lost his life in this strike, which took place in the region of North Waziristan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a high security officer.
The guard, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, moved to London, had informed the British Government that discussions had been undertaken with the Tehran and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the movement of Pakistani Taliban.
Tripodi is not influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New Wales, Joe Tripodi, will conduct an investigation of the State's anti-corruption regulator.
The former Minister of New Wales, Joe Tripodi, has not changed the commercial base policy at the request of his political liar Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets located in the area controlled by the government.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out whether Mr. Obeid had pressed several State ministers to renew his baths in Circular Quay, where the Obeids had two restaurants and a coffee, after their release in August 2005, without any bids.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was in the interest of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Assistant Secretary-General of Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the Government pressed for low bids to be made.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the discounts on Circular Quay companies, which reported to Obeid about $2.5 m per year, were renewed without any bids.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was in favour of tenders.
However, he had not changed his policy at Mr. Obeid's request, which, in recognition of Mr. Tripodi, claimed a change in government policy on land.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to ICC revealed appeals in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who arrived at the Department of Ports after working under the orders of M. Obeid to the Ministry of Fisheries.
"Was the debate during these telephone conversations the development of trade-related policy?" Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi.
“ No, ” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, that wasn't it.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, declaring a responsible person
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday evening, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The officer did not specify what the target was, but said he had at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried air raids against missiles in Syria.
Foreign workers with a visa 457 might have to pass a "identity test"
The Government is currently considering the possibility of introducing a "authentication" test for foreign workers with a view to 457 while considering extending the repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a criteria designed to prevent visas 457 from being used for non-qualified posts or as a means to bring his or her family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was released today while working Member Maxine McKew announced the government talk on foreign workers, saying he could offend Australia's neighbours.
"Milling statements on "foreign foreigners returning to the end of the file" and "Employment for the Australians" are an unfortunate return at the time when trade unions called for a protected labour market," she said to Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as a result of this historical artifact.
The working paper was made of 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the proposed changes, the others being under review.
If the "identity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to know "if the offer of employment is authentic in the case where the applicant is a relationship or personal association of the owner or of the person concerned within the undertaking which sponsors it".
Companies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, with the intention of sponsoring a small number of workers, were actually employed by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would die from a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers on Christmas Island this week.
The son of a nine-year-old son of a man who had been in Australia with him found some comfort from his father's death at an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study designed to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd leaves the view that services at high speed up to Scotland and north of England will continue from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Minister of Baron Transport Kramer said that the project would "really assemble the United Kingdom".
The Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said "excited" to work with the British Government on the project.
Phase 1 will take on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is finished, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government reimbursed the estimated cost of building a high-speed connection between London and northern England, ranging from 32.7 MD to 42.6 MD.
The British Government, speaking with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the length of roads for the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of three-hour travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Baroness Kramer stated: "Our goal for HS2 is to bring about a truly national network that will approach the United Kingdom and its cities."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it provides are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British State Secretary for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called Mr Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown stated: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the global high-speed rail network project throughout Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government in order to examine the options to launch the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating a benefit for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I am eager to read the review report with the British ministers next year, and we will then decide together on the next steps."
Rules relating to the use of electronic devices on board remain for the moment in Australia
Australian passengers will need to continue to expand their tablets and smartphones in the course of landing and landing despite the United States management to supplement the regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "air".
Passengers can already do it for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their electronic books during landing and landing.
The Australian carriers consider the decision to force American carriers to carry out an important work in order to comply with the requirements, but indicated that they did not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it examined the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
" CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," she said.
The issue is the subject of a regulation which requires aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained continuously and passengers comply with the safety signals provided by crew members.
Virgin, who had already told CASA of his intention to extend the use of its online entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said that it would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve customer experience now that we have (from the free-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes," said a spokesman.
Kandas stated that she was currently respecting the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during landing and landing, and we did not intend to change it immediately," she said.
The FAO decision applies to American airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the decision of FAO and its reasons.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to the other and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Transporters will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing manuals, training equipment, hand-held luggage programmes and passenger signals.
"As long as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light electronic portable devices, such as tablets, electronic books readers and smartphones at all levels," the FAO said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to extend their equipment during landing.
The Panel also recommended that the most heavy equipment be fitted safely under seating or upper compartments during landing and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in a violent baggage
Pia's small community has known an unusual superhero on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crew of 30 people according to the evidence collected...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was spent on the side of Pia, where a river involving several people scattered from the side of the post.
Four minor injuries should at least be depleted.
Alertly, the gendarmes have made themselves available to separate the Belgians and to ensure that the wounded are taken into custody.
Singapore's gay priests take advantage of middle classes that are bound to close the belt.
In a gay priest at the Bendemeer Trade Center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a necklace, a bag and a pair of gold gold balls to pay the school fees of his daughters.
"My husband and I came to buy a house, so all my money is part of it," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she received $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the application is similar in some parts of South-East Asia – where the completion of households increases – that ValueMax, where it has performed its transaction, has become the third gay loan company this week to be introduced to the Singapore branch.
Taking in money is not just a quick way to get liquid money – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is almost as good as the bank loans are not guaranteed.
In general, Singapore's gay employers take an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above 15.4% offered by the U.S. Overseas Bank, a local fund value that has a subsidiary in the same commercial centre.
However, gay employers have the advantage of not asking for solvency verification or proof of pay, and they can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to gay employers, while families feel the pressure to increase the cost of life and the overcrowding of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the good market credit fed by a very low monetary policy in the advanced economies, families with low and medium incomes turn to gay priests to bridge the gap while their economies know a slowdown.
This week, the standard rating agency & Poor's mentioned the growing decline in households, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the ratio of the gross domestic product of Asia's highest domestic production.
Malaysia is on the list with 80 per cent of GDP, while this rate rose to 60 per cent in 2008.
The economists also fear the high level of consumer closure in Thailand, which is a little of a technical recession this week.
Thursday, data showed a continuous decline in exports and slowing down consumer demand.
"The balance is that with the rise of costs, people in the environment or at the bottom [of the salary scale] are trying to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economicist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have made people forced to put their personal effects into practice to touch the value of their pet species.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the goods placed in the 200 state-owned gas loans are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, we'll put the chain in the mother's gold and we'll go back to look for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest loan shop operator, EasyMoney, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using their shops in recent months.
The increase is similar in the gas loan sector such as ValueMax, operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like it in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighboring Malaysia – where he already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its general guide.
The company will finance them using 60 per cent of Singapore's 66 MM that it took this week to introduce it to Singapore.
While some low-rate employers have rejected the criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Mr. Yeah indicates that the level of gambling offers not only higher rates than other employers, but also does not increase the debt directly.
"Client customers imagine the property they already own, and the fact that their personal property is money does not increase the income of households," she said.
Getting married is better socially accepted as a means of achieving short-term guaranteed funding.
The people who return to the gay employers are not just those who have financial problems.
The people who live in Singapore will also go to the ValueMax Gaige Award Shops to apply the Rolex Golden Lings or Shows, which can represent up to 60% of their purchase price in species.
We see customers from all sides of society.
"This may be people who need short-term employment for commercial or investment activities, or small businesses who have a need for leadership in order to pass a difficult task," adds Mr. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth pastor in the Halifax region in New Scotland is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following investigations at his home and at the National Research Council's office.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was officially appointed, is said to be deeply enthralled by this new one.
In a communiqué, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 or access to the Internet.
It will be compared to a provincial court in Halifax in December.
It becomes a Nazi uniform on the supermarket before it's broken.
A man dressed in a uniform Nazi-barred brasard with the wide cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers crying at the head of the station who called the police, said the store on Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesman from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to withdraw, but "the time it comes, it was already part of it," she added.
I used to cry when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were good mouth.
"You don't come out in the street unless you want to attract attention," said a client, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, in Cambridge News.
This incident took place Thursday, the day of Halloween's festival, where it is customary to go to the monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a channel.
A Cambridge man claimed the responsibility of this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I wear a black SS shoulder twice a week from three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems".
225 M$ rescue plan for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the 325 MM rescue plan for the vaccination health system is subject to strict conditions in order to ensure that the Government will not spend the funds.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking urgent action to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the system's constraints.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with the independent member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, we think, will solve the unique difficulties the State is facing," said Mrs. Plibersek today.
The $325 M plan includes a 31 MM campaign for non-required surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to reverse the delay.
Funding is also provided for clinics without your appointment in Hobart and Lanceston, better external care, medical training, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical files systems in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the idea that, according to the first line clinics, it is the best way to care for Tasmania's health system," said Mrs. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would be faced with a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive the money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides the most effective and efficient services.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 M won't account for much " unless they have been followed by a genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system".
However, he commended the Government for responding to the urgent request for assistance that he presented to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania's public health system from the black list," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-required procedures will in most cases reverse the recent cuts.
But the health opposition spokesman Peter Dutton thinks today's announcement is a "fortuitous solution".
"The reason why we are here is that the state-owned government has withdrawn $430 from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
There can't be a government of the State that pulls almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300, and pretends it's a tough day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Niclaux of the novel de Denis Diderot is marked by a remarkable artistic direction and a minute restoration of time, but it is also more workable than it should be.
In France in the 1760s, she relates the historical dream of Suzanne, a young aristocracy sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the unbridled cruelty of a superheroly Sadic Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never goes into luxury or sensoryism, and that's the problem.
The conscious silence of the narrative could also become a prison for the public.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, declaring the monitoring body
Syria destroyed the major arms production and ammunition equipment, declared the international monitoring body of the Jewish chemical weapons, while violent attacks were taking place in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents were supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also reported that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) was made with a date of progress on the limited date of the
1 November established by the organization based in La Haye ordering Damascus to destroy or "make useless" all chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gases and fill the ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious calendar to destroy the chemical weapons of Damas from mid-2014.
As a result of the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damas still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including gas and the neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made when the fighting took place in Safira city, which, according to experts, opened a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, reported to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in Great Britain.
The group of combatants, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of militias based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad were killed, of which 18,678 were combatants of the pro-government forces and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah soldiers.
Of the deaths, 2,202 were also believed to have been deserters and some 5,375 combatants of the opposition, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people were killed in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad's troops fight against the rebels, many of whom are linked to Al-Qaïda network groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not give any clarification.
The fighting highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors while they had to complete their mission, which was to devastate Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that would disappear in closed times.
An OIAC statement, which works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was “now satisfied to control – and see the destruction – all the critical production and machinery for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no other inspection activities were planned for the moment".
Earlier this week, the inspectors reported that they had completed the first phase of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damas.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
Jeudi, OIAC said that both sites were, according to Syria, "refused and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected".
It was difficult to know for the first time whether Safira unit was one of the two sites that IAC inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a comprehensive plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the IOAC Executive Committee.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage all of you have demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmet Uzumcu, director-general of the organization, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war is mainly opposed to the Sunni Islamic rebels in the Government of El Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alaoiites section, a branch of the Chichi Islam.
On the other hand, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a strong explosion of Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
The anger caused by the penalty against one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and close relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the punishment against the last conspirators to be translated into justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution bell.
Patek, who was almost 10 years old when he was one of Asia's most researched men in the south of Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks.
It could be released for 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was recognized as guilty of mass murder for attacks aimed at two nights in the Kuta popular tourist district, which caused the death of 202 people, 88 Australians, and many injuries.
He was also recognized as guilty of many other charges of terrorism, including a vogue of concerns regarding churches throughout Indonesia on the Christmas Day in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for a permanent recluse, but they could have asked that the man, as a "Demolation Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision saved painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-olds, Jane and Jenny in the destructions of Patek and the other conspirators almost 10 years ago.
On the plain of tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be trained in front of the execution button," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other children, not seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in an outdoor fireplace, exploded just after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze broke a bag of two explosives in 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was “dead” three times when he was under respiratory care.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before others.
Keeping alive, therefore, there is no reason to keep it alive.
Passing 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others is not very much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be translated into justice.
He had managed to avoid being arrested for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottbad, where American forces will kill the former chief of Al-Qaïda, Ususama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that reports of information services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet well Laden in order to restore links between South-East Asia and Al-Qaida terrorist groups.
"He didn't do it," said Mrs. Corteen.
Until recently, he had been exaggerating from the chaos he had caused to other people.
The conference was held in the wake of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek, however, may call for this condemnation.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but not pass an appeal with their mobile phone)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their electronic port devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not to talk on their mobile phone – under the very new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will take place will vary from one airline to the other, said FAO administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will need to prove to FAO that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules on the arrangement of equipment to be in compliance with them.
FAO stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of companies that have already submitted plans.
"In accordance with the plan, we could approve the extensive use of electronic devices very soon," said FAO in a statement.
At present, passengers must extend their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the airport doors are closed.
They were not allowed to light the lights before the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green fire.
Passengers are supposed to extend their aircraft at the bottom of the plane before landing and do not light them until the aircraft is installed.
Under new directives, air carriers whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during landings, landings and landings on the ground, FAO stated.
Most of the new line planes and other aircraft that have been modified to enable passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attenants, was happy to see these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with transporters for it – this will be beneficial to the whole world,” explained Glading in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange e-mails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers should put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So not always with Words With Friends, the online game Scrabble that played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was thrown out of a American Airlines plane after refusing to extend his device while the device was locked at the door.
And the more heavy devices like portable computers should always be ranked because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
On-board mobile phones will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for portable phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAO.
FAO may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during landing and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national safety expert on CBS News, stated that portable phones were always considered to be a risk.
"Telephones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile telephone antennas if they were used on board," said Rosenker.
An Industrial Advisory Committee established by FAO to address the problem recommended that the Government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAO has increased over the past few years in order to supplement the restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-MO, claim that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
The restrictions are also more difficult to apply because the use of devices has become universal.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to extend their devices, or deliberately do so.
FAO began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interfaces with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New line planes depend much more on electrical systems than previous generation of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by FAO.
Air carriers allow their passengers to use the Wi-Fi to cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified planes to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interferences.
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow wider use of electronic devices under new directives, said Huerta.
Electronic devices today generally emit much less power transmission than previous generation of devices.
E-book readers, for example, send only minimum broadcasts when one page is turned.
But transmissions are stronger when devices send money or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who are pressureing for the addition of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders carried a line plane of readers from Kindle's electronic books and wanted to see if there were any problems, but there was no one there.
This inspired members of the FAO Advisory Committee on Mixed Feelings on the issue of whether the use of devices is present or not.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers stated that he thought that the interferences from devices were real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only anecdotic reports of pilots indicating that devices can interact with aircraft systems and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAO allow pilots to request passengers to extend their equipment during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for well-being arrangements for skilled travelers.
"We are pleased that FAO recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird of a North Sea platform was released in nature
A bird, helicoptered after being exposed to a oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
The water flow on the side of Aberdeen's helicopter was mounted the last month before it was sent on foot by the Ecosassian SPCA in its Alloa rescue center.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This river of water was probably a winter migrants coming from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the abandoned bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "It was impossible to call again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water flow was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing companies together and defining what rich and job makers want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
In order to do so, we ordered the largest and most complete investigation to the heads of British businesses and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all the sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be surprising to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of enterprises are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernizing and developing as the EU's States are moving forward.
They want to see the Government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than focusing on the long and long process of reform of European institutional archives.
When asked for advice on specific policy points – from the regulation of monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key competencies should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has brought general satisfaction, which companies say that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits it has to share in the European trading area – 40% of the major companies, traditionally the most pro-European ones, are also agreed.
Finally, and more importantly, our investigation with business leaders revealed that an important majority wanted to see Britain continue its initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a "significant change" that renders power to the United Kingdom.
The issues are high – changing the Treaty and better representing the interests of Britain would allow a 16% reduction in the vote in favour of the country's maintenance in the EU at a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt that this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Great Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and more necessary, to better represent the interests of British businesses, as the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Great Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
The United States of Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama did not depart from Halloween tradition.
With his wife, yesterday evening, he distributed friands to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the House-Blanche in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivals on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of the hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the parties have fallen apart.
In New York, thousands of people have participated in the parade organized in the Greenwich village district.
The whole world is excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
Me, I was finally able to put the custom I had planned the last year.
We're moving like fools, add Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a national festival celebrated in the Tussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that the gas pipeline in Bulgaria is opening a new gas line
The start of the construction of the South Stream Gasoduc in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the Director of Gazprom.
"A historic event has taken place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gasoduc, the largest project in Europe," explained Alexei Miller, director general of Gazprom, in a Jewish statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the whole of the European continent.
South Stream should be able to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual difference between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, the country through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe is transferred, increases the risk level relative to the conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that direct joining to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with the countries of transit are permanently eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate until the entire project is implemented in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should take place in other countries that are in decline from the end of the year.
The gasduc was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday The New Tahiti News, re-enacting information from Australia's Radio.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, on the midway between New Zealand and Chile.
This area measures 47 km2, if you count three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the citizens of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English sea that takes place in three Hollywood adaptations.
A few tens of residents, mostly of the citizens of the Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95 per cent of London's generosity.
The island Council voted in favour of creating a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836.000 km2, which corresponds to its exclusive economic area.
An assistant to the island's master has gone to London to ask the Great Britain to confirm this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify those 836,000 km2, provided that it has the means to ensure its monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no place to place military surveillance ships.
As far as France is concerned, it must already carry out the very cost of air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian ZEE, near Pitcairn.

Living Prison for an Ancient Chinese Deputy Governor
An old Deputy Governor of Jilin Province, in the northeastern China, was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption.
Except for the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million young women of vandalism, reports the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped businesses and responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first Intermediate Court on its microblogging.
President Xi Jinping, who took his office in March last, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon was a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself.
If the head of the State promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigres" as with the "mugs" - the subcontractors - only a handful of high-ranking officials were condemned, among them were former frameworks of the Petrochina oil giant.
The most spectacular case was that of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having visited the highest functions within the State.
However, the Government has not expressed its intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent body of the party.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assaults following allegations made against Jonathan Lord during a hearing by the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the South New Wales YMCA were charged with sexual assaults against children following allegations made against the teacher of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, during a hearing by the Royal Committee on Sexual Abuse on Children.
However, in its opening statement to the Commission, YMCA stated that "there has never been a problem of sexual aggression against children within its organization".
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned on two matters: an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography and a physical education monitor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assaults on children at the centre he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, counsellor to the Commission that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not in the course of the second case.
He also admitted that the opening statement of YMCA was inaccurate, "the external controls of YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst of four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working in the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they had to report any violation of the child security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was sentenced to sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's deficiencies to children's safety.
The staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, that he kept them seated on his knees, that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was framed by Lord and who had asked for training in child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said she was in charge of child services at YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, which would be “very scary and difficult to approach most of the time”.
The Director-General said he rejected the evidence of staff who were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their hierarchical superior.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord had broken their judgment, which made them not aware of their actions.
Mr. Hare said he had expressed his views before the South-South New Wales YMCA Council saying that, for the organization, the lessons learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not be affected by the "sign" by the staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign confidential agreements to staff shortly after the allegations had been made was taken by the Director-General of the YMCA for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an "excessive of jealousy" and that it had not been implemented.
The South New Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, by Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "some serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiative, training and staff supervision.
The hearing was updated until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister, but he admits that his return is unlikely.
In an interview on the last night marking the 5th anniversary of its departure at the end of its term of office, 59-year-old man made himself aware of various national policies.
Since its departure in June 2007, after a decade in the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments on foreign affairs and the role of the Special Envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East Peace Process.
When asked if he would like to find the Prime Minister's post, Mr. Blair would have answered, according to London's Standard Evening: "Yes, of course, but it may probably happen, so..."
When many experts in these exhibitions met in Cardiff to face and overcome the year's Cheval trophie, they knew that competition would be bad.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, all-petty and his Shetland Toffee scored during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank district centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
When presenting against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his coat jacket a bit on the side of the decorated way to defecate his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his unusual nature of dress for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton was gifted to Toffee for his 3rd anniversary in March and has been trained since with his poet Shetland every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffee are doing a great job."
They presented themselves against and against all, but the two highlighted the gold cap and the rosette.
It was only the second time he worked with Toffee and we were glad he got it.
On the track, people who didn't know him didn't think he was so phenomenal that they wanted to photograph him.
This young man, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in concerts for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air, and the whole world was encouraging and appealing."
He spent the whole length of the track running and even though it seemed to be all small, he did a great job.
Fenton is a dog of animals – he worships horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he started, he will soon participate in the annual Cheval exhibition – and I am sure he will make a good performance.
"Fenton has only been 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well present and the way they stood on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the dresser – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud to go.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be removed ”
A Chinese newspaper that launched an appeal on the first page for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be rehabilitated, stating a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to the television that he had accepted wines to produce stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will come up with a “complete repair, ” said the regulator.
The "remaniment" order consists of the administration of Guangdon for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the Zoomlon County Society between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express edition was disorganized,” said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card”.
He also "commanded the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete New Express repair, and recommended that it conduct an investigation on the persons responsible for the New Express and immediately maintain the newspaper management team".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a singer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his journal published two calls on the first page for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories against money.
"In this case, I spent my time in Zoomlion as well as in the media industry and in its capacity to gain public confidence," he said on the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebrity.
I've made myself aware of my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his excuses on the first page, writing that he had not verified his articles correctly.
Several important suspects have recently made television sets.
Specialists say that people are systematically obliged to make their own opinions, despite a change in the law which was voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from imprisoning themselves.
The Charles-de-Galle airport in "invisibility"
In Toulon, the airport is on schedule.
The release of radioactive steam detected on one of Charles-de-Galle's two nuclear warheads in mid-October and when the boat was in the sea, it was "without danger for the sea", but not without consequences for the Marine.
The Royale has come to confirm the ship's "impossibility" until "the mid-November", "the time to take corrective action" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS company, a defence vessel specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, located in Var for the occasion, "are currently operating on the airport".
It is for them, among others, to change a pump on the failing heat.
"All is implemented to enable Charles-de-Galle to carry out his planned deployment at the end of 2013," explains DNA.
And the National Marine to ensure that "it does not give up on the ship's programme of activities" to nuclear proponents.
We recall that Charles-de-Galle's airport ended in an average period of six months.
He was equipped with Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young chess pilots.
A "various petite", which is surrounded by the reactor's limitation space, was then produced on the amicral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, I have also found a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: demonstration of their property reassessment, tax relief, all kinds of permits, administrative costs to no longer end.
Bref, syphony without limits from our pockets.
Millions of dollars spent could be separated to allow a highly respected tax on those who suffer.
All money taken out of force to taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their recovery.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no doubt about the total expenditure and the maintenance of bottlenecks: weak cultural centre, strong subsidies to the Energy City, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they are sold to the private company or disposed of.
It is also worth noting the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a larger industry that has never come.
However, I give a honourable mention of the transformation of old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
This is not for public investment in such enterprises, but for the private sector based on consumer demand.
The citizens were happy to learn that the lakes in the Sea and the Piles will continue to provide the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (great water consumers) and the great decline of the population, the use of water has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Without saying the gaspler, the city will never lack water and strict regulation on its use could be very appropriate.
In summary, it is easy to make big things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of more than 200 million dollars, this city is no longer able to buy a style without passing through an empire rule.
We've been managed for more than 40 years by prostitutes with excellent diplomas for most people, and I don't think that a taller of mottons makes it worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway route
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet per 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, moving on a long-term equivalent to about six long-distance football fields, is linked to deposits near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, and the United States.
The area is filled with endless deposits, which can easily dissipate drug-loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were unopened, the authorities said.
The authorities received 8,5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was opened, according to the judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They have been sentenced to ten years in prison for eternal imprisonment if they have been sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drain channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered following the Marijuana harvest in the center of Mexico in October, making a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of some 700 yards equipped with ferret roads that were part of the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went to two stores in San Diego.
British police deliver an extradition warrant against Assange
The British police have today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Embassy of Ecuador in London and requested political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had delivered a "response notice" to Australia for 40 years, asking him to submit to a police commission, adding that if he had not done so, he might have been arrested.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden following the allegations of sexual crime, after having issued all possible ways under the British law after the Supreme Court had invalidated the appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow its transfer to the United States, he found refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking for political asylum in South America.
Scotland Yard "has delivered a notice of resignation to a 40-year-old man asking him to present himself to a police commission, at the time and time of his choice," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under custody.
The Ambassador refused to comment on the delivery of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being expelled from Sweden to the United States where he may be accused of spying, after having released more than 250 000 American diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks fighting secret information.
How Biometry Envasived Our Lives
Do you finish the words to tap to access your smartphone or pay for your purchase?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric capturers of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as well as the Internet.
The organizations devoted to the protection of private life confirm this ignorance for the biometric, but are concerned.
In 2011 and France, the National Commission for Information and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of entrepreneurs, the form of hand or hand-to-hand networks in companies, administrations, canteens...
"All the world will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anywhere," said Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in one another, and in another, in another?
The biometric will be based on new techniques, which will allow new services for citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are digital inputs, hand-overs and the visual network of rain or moisture.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"For example, some people who work on concrete have very wide-ranging fingers and their impressions are illusory," notes Philippe Robin, the Technical Director of the Identical Area at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the wine network and the spread of the hand implies a voluntary and precise management of the people.
This is both a security - we cannot capture these data - and one is inconceivable: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
As a result, research has been conducted for 20 years on other approaches, such as the recognition of the face or the eye (the colored part of the eye).
These techniques become operational by increasing the precision of the receivers and the ability to calculate computers required for data analysis.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, calculation Cyrille Bataller, director of the Accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or an iris in motion.
"Today, we do research on the recognition of voice or how to walk through sound capturers, but a quiet environment is needed," says Sridhar Iyengar, director of Intel Labs Security Research.
Unique and infamous marker, DNA also raises expectations and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the latest biometric data," confirmed Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and the prospectus to CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a cost of 90,000 euros to analyse DNA samples on the location of a crime and in an hour.
The use of the biometric is divided into two groups: identification (recognising one person among others) and authentication (to ensure that the person is what it claims to be).
The identification has so far been the delivery of identity papers: biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with information that the State already has on all citizens.
This allows you to make sure that a person does not try to exploit the identity of someone else.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
NEC thus proposes the recognition of VIP at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We will recover the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that freely travel on the Internet," explained Danny Nassif, in NEC France, of commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a photo of someone who makes the noise in a store, follow his progress through facial recognition and calculate the time to wait.
Authentication relates to the start of physical access (fronts, protected places, canteens...) or logic (opening a computer).
More recently, the control of the presence has been added.
"A biometric point avoids the phenomenon of the copain that points for another," explains Cyrile Bataller, of Accenture.
However, further authentication will also involve transactions, particularly those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing their card and placing their hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the cover of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villanuve-d'Ascq and Angoulème by the Natural Security Society in partnership with large distribution banks and teachings: when paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not break his code, but introduced it into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is intended to last for six months.
If it is final, biometric readers could soon reach French traders.
Tracks to ensure users
There are three ways to make biodegradable in the eyes of the great public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to the biometric, a client remains in box 30 seconds less, it is valuable," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to provide personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you options to measure.
Finally, comfort by putting in advance the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"Digital printers are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin, from Thales.
However, in the absence of a thorough study, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Specialists for the protection of private life continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras, and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me afraid of the worst: generalized surveillance," said Andrew Patrick of the Commission for the Protection of Private Life in Canada.
A driver running at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs has seen an amanda of £1,000
A car driver has seen an increase of £1,000 to have cycled to 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in the Essex, was reported driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120th floor of Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they discovered the wood to carry between their legs.
In the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the need for caution and attention.
The seven points on his permit led to a 6-month permit withdrawal.
Howie was also convicted of paying costs up to £90 and a surtax for a victim of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners to expose London's bull
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the amount of capital tax, but expects a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, entered a 7 per cent stamp right for properties costing more than 2 MM and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties within a company than for individual title.
The right of stamp is already applicable to the residential properties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea rounds, and represents 708 M€ on the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber meetings.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in the law on the property of high value and the introduction of the Anti-Fraud Law on the subject, it is very difficult to advance that property of high value is subject to tax regardless of the effects of the absolute housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors less responsive to the idea of buying properties in London or current owners who are less responsive to the idea of selling," he added.
The loan real estate – 5-10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector in southern London, which is located in Fulham, Wimbledon, has increased by 11.8% in the last year.
Prices in the centre of London show a steady annual growth of 5.6 per cent but have been eclipsed by a "internal market" in full growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4 per cent) and the east (6.5 per cent) known as the Savilles studies.
Scientists come to light the way the movements of a dog's neck are linked to its smell.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs have increased their weight to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nerve dogs have moved it to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientific at Trente University, said: "The whole world knows that, in man, the right side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in incentives that raise positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what he was in other species.
He added that the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the movements of other dogs, researchers have followed animals by watching movies of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will certainly not take long before we understand why their neck sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Valortigara explained: “We have presented to dogs the films of other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other cause of confusion – and we have been able to deal with the movement of the cake and present it as more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog without an expression retiring the neck to the right (from the point of view of the dog that removes the neck), they were completely detained.
But when they experienced a cold mainly due to the left (again from the dog's point of view that removes the cold), their heart rate accelerated and they had anxious air.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you meet several times of other dogs and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their bones to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will respond on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and designers to better appreciate the emotions of their animals.
Canine expert John Bradshaw, a professor invited to the University of Bristol University of Veterinary Sciences School, explained that this was not the first study to consider the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team of Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dogs were more likely to go to a robot dog when their neck moved to the left than to the right instead of to be anxious – the reverse of what is in the Italian study.”
He indicated that differences could arise from the fact that dogs who participated in various studies did not fully consider the animals of movies or robotic dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
“Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, a lot of details must still be specified – and dogs are not exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why they sometimes move from one side to the other.
Arctic Monkeys holds a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group reported a concert in Glasgow after it was diagnosed with a lyrics in its singer.
Sheffield's group had to be held on Friday in The Hydro concert hall in the city center.
However, his lyrics forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was obliged to report a concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham Thursday.

Pope François named his first cardinals in February
Pope François listed new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22nd, he announced the Vatican Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest men of the church in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who choose him, so François will appoint his first group of men who will definitely choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, since a cardinal reaches 80 years of age, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – this therefore leads to a group of 120 "electronic cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman from the Vatican, said that a meeting to gather all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which the bishops would be raised to the dignity of the cardinal, known as the constable.
"The father of François decided to communicate his decision to convene the February summit in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings necessary for the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Catholic Voix said that since February, the number of electoral cardinals has probably decreased.
He stated that a pope was generally appointed as cardinals that he needed so that the number of electoral cardinals would reach 120 and so many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wished.
The composition of the next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope François in March of that year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a sort of trend towards privileged Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will number the cardinals of the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40 per cent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be elected since François formed the board of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from the world to examine ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope had decided everything.
"Now François chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "as far as possible" that François sought advice from cardinals.
But we have never known such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero pointed out that the papers were generally taller than the Eves representing large communities in the cardinal class, but that François was “full of surprises – so we don’t know what to name it.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seating folder
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new peaks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to address a problem with the files manually incinerated, according to a Friday statement by the American body responsible for the regulation of vehicle safety.
In some pickups, previous seats could present a defect at the level of the inclination mechanism.
As a result, the files do not respect the federal vehicle safety standards for support.
"If the vehicle is damaged by the rear, support may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The models mentioned were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American car manufacturer since its failure and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the default pickup during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to examine the letter of information to owners due to the 16-day closure of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of pickups Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by around 20% during the first 10 months of the year, declared GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pickups Silverado and 16 503 pickups Sierra.
The GM's action rate was 1.4 per cent to reach $37,47 at New York’s post-mier season.
A dead worker sucks under concrete blocks
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday before noon, in Montreal.
The drama took place at 11 a.m. on the Marquette Street, near the intersection of the Beaubien Street, in the vicinity of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to all estimates, the work on the foundations has been on this site for some time.
A mythical foundation wall had to be built during the last days.
The accident occurred when the victim arrived on the site to recover his tools.
I was in the car and I saw the wall crashing with a big smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who is still near the edge of the bridge.
I'm exhausted, and I'm going to take away the big glasses that would recover it.
We only saw a part of her two, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an old man in the 50th century who worked for a fraud company.
Reanimation manuals have been tried by emergency services but failed.
Man has not survived his severe injuries.
An inspector of the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was posted on the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair from a choicer from Obama
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He said Obama made commendable efforts in connection with the Obstructionistism of the Republican Party.
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign's memory is a sad reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying in the 2nd year of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a book that's so sad these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I fell asleep, this book reminds me of the time when politics inspired millions of people and where talks could cut you down.
The election ended with a devastating victory, and the present-day journalists took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends were happy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced to the House-Blanche and the nation was ready for the change.
During the transition period of Obama before it took office in 2008, he had 82% favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Return here is a difficult revelation, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, which are like long memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
From the passage of the Affordable Care Act (the Act on Approachable Care) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "not known or seen" and the murder of Oussama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partitional obscenity has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But once I have repeatedly defended Obama's administration against my parents and colleagues, I am no longer able to provide explanations.
I'm on the side of political disappointment.
The Republican ban cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of foreign children without drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on American private life, or on the prosecution of complainants who reveal the Government's errors.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlik, an American citizen, without trial, or the removal of public funding and the excess of the expenditure authorized during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report saying that the efforts of the House-Blanche to reduce the media in silence are "the most aggressive... since Nixon administration".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a single Internet site for more than three years after the Act on the Afordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that the government could oppose the political campaigns that have been taking place.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, since the political part of opposition and events that are occurring by hazard, such as Newton's massacre, affect our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have cited above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited by her application.
Mitt Romney had a confusing and low-frequency alternative that seemed unable to determine his policies or his positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term, being free from the pressure of future elections, would have had the promises we had been meant to speak for so long.
However, while the number of favourable opinions increased by 45 per cent this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me wish for the many promises that have been made.
This week, I read part of the book describing how Obama suffered enormous losses in the benefits of Clinton to the Pennsylvania Springs.
At a follow-up meeting, he told his team that they had to return on the right path and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We have to remember who we are.
We see you five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, at 15 a.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place in Retine Street in Fléron.
The mother, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fléron, didn't carry a case.
Despite the rapid intervention of aid, it was destroyed at this border collapse.
Clive Palmer claims that President Tony Abbott has an interest in the parental leave system.
The billionaire Member Clive Palmer suggests Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on the parental leave system because his daughters could be encouraged and benefited from this system.
The magnitude of mining extraction, which corresponds to the payment of a carbon tax of $6, has made this argument to try to eliminate any conflict issues.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial at the time of deciding whether carbon and mineral taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to benefit personally from these policies.
"There will be an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether she gets a divorce," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially announced that Mr. Palmer had won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a resounding.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a remand of the suspension system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is completed?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we not have a system in which you can enter, get your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper scraps to mark the ballots.
Is it to be able to delete the result if someone does not agree?
Today, there seems to be an extraordinary piece of paper.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options for the electronic vote and has recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions "very serious".
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of bossed dolphins along the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouverouux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for Conservation and Research of Animals and Measuring Marines (OCEAMM) comes to Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of dolphin in the woods surprise you?
That's good news, but that's not particularly surprising to me.
If by the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomic and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge in species classification sciences.
Furthermore, it is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to re-classify or possess a species of a species, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified the animals, based on the morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are due to the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two very close morphological species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this sub-family: the dolphins in the Pacific forest and the whales in the Atlantic forest.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic diversity.
If this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only presenting it to this place.
Thus, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could have been affected by the extinction of a species rather than by the local disappearance of a population of a wider species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or excluded by the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it should be recovered from nearby stocks.
For what is of the species Sousa kinensis, whose population of the new discovered species is out, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Sea mammals are located above the food chain.
They live in homogenous, open habitats where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals.
This genetic barrier limits the creation of new species.
On the contrary, the more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can lead to the creation of new species.
It needs to be known that the marine environment is the least known.
It is preferable to send robots to Mars, but to know what lives in the Mariannes Valley, only 11 kilometers from the sea surface.
More money is spent in the search for life on planets than in marine research and it is much longer than that.
RBS suspends two traders on the change market
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two trades from its market division according to two close sources of the file, which showed a new time when the global survey of regulators on market manipulation suspects began to bear its fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including U.S., Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the world's most important financial market investigations, where $5.3 billion is changing from hand to hand every day.
The two contractors are the first RBS employees to be suspended in the context of the extension of the investigation that resulted in the scandal of the interbanking rate of Libor.
The bank, who refused to comment on the suspension, confirmed that this month had received requests for information from the regulators.
"The ongoing investigation on this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and the other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, close sources of the file reported that RBS had transmitted instant mail and messages, sent to and by an old British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as a European trader for the JPMorgan loan account.
Rohan Ramchandani, European trader responsible for the exchange of accounts at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, trader of loans at Barclays and U.S., was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traitors made any accusations.
The case of Mr. Usher included instant messages sent to and by bankers working in Barclays and Citigroup, adding close sources to the file.
The UF explained this week that she had attempted an action against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said she was investigating suspicions of market manipulations of changes in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – consider allegations made regarding bankers that would be understood to manipulate the rates on the change market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or requests for information from regulators, indicating close sources of the file.
Banks execute instant messages and e-mails sent over the years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
News on these surveys highlighted trade unions in a sector that was one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment banks in recent years, but which was reimbursed this year because of the low volume of loans that limit the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the broad market of very liquid changes, but older traders explain that this is not necessarily necessary.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the more frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "they explain that it is possible to start having a low-cost impact on the market".
The new came on the same day that the Swiss Credit has announced that a trader has sent a trader to his office in the London Exchange negotiations this week after causing a loss of $6.M at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been managed," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The investigation on Major Rob Ford has been filed, supporting a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby had never seen a "scraped" investigation.
My Ruby said to the Canadian Press that the police had "ignoreed or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
This Thursday, the police arrested the casual friend and driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of exorcising the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said that they had also observed this man delivering churches in Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
My Ruby was "inexplicable" because the police had never broken Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, supporting the police chief Bill Blair's choice of a reason not to act against the mother.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, stop the mayor, and carry out an investigation - even without a warrant.
It would also have been able to request an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police has not commented, but his spokesman Mark Pugash has described Me Ruby as "explaining and desperate attempts" to make a complaint to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference, Thursday, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable motives" that could lead to the deposition of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Budgets in the mid-session, except for London
In addition to London, the main European exchanges are going down on Friday to mid-session, driven by some new decades-old companies, while Wall-Street is expected to increase.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could undermine its policy of quantification earlier than planned.
On the other hand, after an inflation rate of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could complement its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street allow for the opening of American actions to rise after two consecutive sessions.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest load of CAC 40, struck by the warning of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after also publishing results this morning and announced the internal creation of a default structure ("bad bank") consisting of 38 billion best-risk assets books.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) maintains in the head of EuroFirst300 in response to press information that the AT&T studies a possible OPA.
On the change market, the ECB's monetary policy outlooks will be well-trained, as John Hardy, says the Saxo Bank strategy.
The only mandate of the ECB has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act during the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong drop in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its appeal against the US currency and has reached a lower rate of two weeks to $1,3517.
These same concepts support the compulsory market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court is valid for the Obama Health System Reform Act
Great victory for Obama's administration: the U.S. Supreme Court said today that the reform law of the Obama health system was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which requires citizens to sign a health insurance in 2014, under the obligation to pay an amendment, and stated that it was constitutional under the authority of the Government.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, approached the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2 700 pages of the Law and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the level of eligibility in Medicaid should be reduced under the penalty of losing all federal funding of the programme, was consistent with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates to the presidential election in the spring of 2012, including the candidate named Mitt Romney, were deliberately opposed to the law.
Vibrant tribute made to the old combatants in Menton
At the heart of the cemetery of Trabuket, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriot associations, made this Friday afternoon, a tribute to soldiers and missing persons from all wars.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military barracks of the cemetery by Mrs Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Enlargement between Palestinians and Israelis at Gaza border
Four combatants from Hamas were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, 31 October 2013, during an increase in the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power station in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday, November 1, after an explosion of its fuel stocks, the Authority announced the energy of the Palestinian slave.
A local commander of the Brigades Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another frame of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Bareikh, were killed by an incarceration of Israeli army in the east of Khan Yenès, in the south of Gaza, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Brigades Al-Qassam, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants carried out a border surveillance operation between the Palestinian slave and Israel.
An attack against a tunnel across the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, a blind Israeli charm and a blind bulldozer had taken a hundred metres inside the territory before leaving.
The attack lasted half an hour, according to the witnesses.
In a communiqué, Hamas' spokesman Sami Abou Zouhri praised the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates Al-Qassam's heroes who have fallen in defense of the territory during an invasion of the Chinese occupation in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the employer," threatened the spokesman.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the objective of its operation was to start a section of a large tunnel across Israeli territory since the Palestinian slave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, to "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," said military spokesman Peter Lerner.
Israel also struck an air-based military base in the north-west of Syria, aimed at carrying missiles intended for the Lebanese smooth movement Hezbollah, reported the Al-Arabya satellite channel on Thursday, 31 October.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not provide details on the target.
"For the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he was pleased to add.
Officials of the Government of Israel refused to confirm any information on such an attack.
Citing the "exclusive sources" it did not mention, the Saudi capital chain stated that "the bombing referred to a cargo of solar missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese chain movement that combats the rebels on the side of the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had conducted several explosions heard in the cave in an air defence base at Sonar Jablé, near Lattakié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of military and medical sources, was not able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chowinard, who presents in Dance his two new group choreographers: Henri Michaux's first inspired poems and poems, the second insulated by the famous solos of the Gymnopédies of Satie's piano.
An evening that allows you to see all the chouinard's impressions, the art of the stars and the black of the sky in white.
A white screen with a background wall.
On the tapes, as white as in the vast space that is the House of Commons, comes from profile, end as a line and black clothing, a body.
On the screen, a series of Henri Michaux is designed.
The body, just treat, takes its shape.
And this form will be the whole part: a field of physical representations of drawings.
The dancers, completely dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the game area, precipitate when the next graph appears, incargent, withdraws.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in solo relations, group to unity (a single mass), large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think of "Glorie of the Morning", where, on the island, Chouinard carried out a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online at the front screen.
It's the same principle, PowerPoint version giant.
Here, music is strong, percussion and electrical guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a wedding when Carol Priest will flee under the dance tape, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or retention, a part of Michaux's poem, monocorde and monotone in the crying, and will continue dancing.
And the music to distribute, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if possible, ends by drying and freezing.
As is the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashs - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - such as these hair that escapes or these black tissues that extend the lines.
But the choreographic approach is missing from composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of Michaux's work, was obliged, with his uncles.
As a result, the bodies look flat in front of the designs.
The corners of Michaux, like Gestalt's forms, open a wider and gibowic imager than the dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers attached to a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a dark theater, comes to the magic.
The audience loved it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the stroke, is more rich.
The scene is partly covered with grass, dancers and a piano are covered with fabric, such as furniture in a remote house.
At the piano, dancers are related to playing the parties.
Their music, touching addresses, give true fragility.
On stage, the couples, in two lovely, very sensitive, even erotic.
Groupwork, small transition solos, all moving, colors, writing is less binary.
Buffons also appear, also family members of Chouinard, treeing red nose, in the loving parades of very polarized men and women.
Lovers are Carnassians, fugitives or players.
The dining room, laughter and small crisis are well transformed by the archaic, grace and rhythm of the coyote bodies, of which they are based.
But the piece takes its real turn after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the public leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall, the universes explored are superseded, the cabotine dancers, descend among the spectators, shouts, smoke, short-circuits, play codes of applause, excavate the sauce in a fairly calculated desert that remains sensitive.
The joy and the folie survive, and it's the art of Chuinard, there, to pollute the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the subject of judicial proceedings on Nortel patents
The group holding thousands of old Nortel patents started a legal process of juju patents against portable telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company that it cofified at the sale of patents that took place after Nortel's failure.
Rockstar, the Consortium who acquired Nortel patents for 4,5 MD, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Court of Associates in Texas.
Rockstar is arrested jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow for publication in relation to Internet research terms, have indicated the conclusions of the trial, which is the heart of Google measuring.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make mobile phones that operate under Google Android operating system, which provides a great deal of competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally offer 4.4 MD$.
After losing Nortel's patents in Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for a amount of $12.5 MD, a partial market based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although it has failed in its attempt to buy patents due to fraud, Google has violated and continues to violate the patents," the trial concludes.
Rockstar claims more important damages and interest in Google's encounter, as he claims that Google's patent violation is prohibited, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a waterproof in the origin of the explosion
The great mother would have burned a cigarette in a gas leak.
The explosion of a room in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old mother and her 5-year-old child, was due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, indicated Friday evening the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert posted on site by the park ensures that the source of the explosion is simply accidental.
The mother gave up a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The vital forecast of the two victims is still underway.
The mother was designed by the explosion and was furious.
The little boy, who lived with his father and his companion, was on his side and was burned slightly.
"The two victims were incubated and long conditioned on the ground before being taken to the Liège CHU, she in helicopter, her ambulance," explained the bourgmestre José Paulet, who went down to the places.
Traumatized, the father was standing at the time of the explosion.
He was able to join the re-scathed by the scalar remained intact while the wall behind the house was completely destroyed.
The father and the tenant of the nearby house, fragmented by the explosion, were registered by the President of the COPAS.
The Andenne and Namur pumps and the Arches police have intervened.
The civilian protection of Krisnee has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first President to be elected free of charge
Mohamed Morsi made the investment summit, but it is unlikely that his triumphal day would mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he presented the investment promise to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected and successful president of Hosni Moubarak who was expelled from the power 16 months earlier.
In his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first independent Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of Egypt since the monarchy's revolution 60 years ago.
He presented himself before the 18 judges in black clothes of the Court, whose building on the Nile border was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We hope for better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said President Morsi during the Sunday ceremony broadcast directly on public television.
"Today, the people of Egypt have laid the foundations of a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States of Muslims, a fundamentalist group that has been regarded as an illegal organization for more than 84 years since its formation.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., at the local hour, followed by a small van.
Only a few hundred supporters were gathered before the Court to appeal to the new President and, following the presidential stance of the Moubarak years, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his carriage into the very frequent streets of the city centre to the south bank.
In view of the low charismatic "cours route" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been significantly strengthened since his victory and his talk on Friday in the course of which he has tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamic but of all who want to finish the work that began in 2011 against President Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue and red dress, addressing the judges present in the orange room where he had been preparing a hard time.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he gave his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national hero while he was in your custody.
The Marèchal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by the song “The People and the Army, Hand in Hand...” and by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and former lay education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on the Tahrir site, where he was part of the lifting that ended last year in the authoritarian regime of Moubarak, and vowed to recover the presidential powers of the military council, which replaced the former vice president, deposited it.
But by agreeing to formally present before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is to be used, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's talk on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the United States bridged the growth of the car market
For 16 days, the closure of most federal administrations focused on the increase in sales of cars in the United States in October, showing the published sales by manufacturers, five of the six main performances that were lower than expected.
The three major producers in Detroit show a two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
The analysts predicted an average of 15.4 million sales at an annual rate and corrected seasonal variations, but the market was 15.3 million according to Adam Jonas's estimates, analyst Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the customers of the bank, it is believed that this slight cut of brake is first explained by the government's "shutdown" and its impact on the consumer's feelings during the first fifteenth of the month".
However, GM has made about 16 per cent of its sales in the last month to 226 402 vehicles, against 211 563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group saw their trade performance improved by October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from the success of his pick-up, saw his sales increase from 14% per year to 191 985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194 301.
On its side, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140,083 vehicles, against 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show lower sales to consensus, despite increases of 8.8 per cent and 14.2 per cent respectively.
At the New York Forum, GM action was won by 1.4% at 16h35 GMT while Ford paid 1.1%.
Renault jumps in Bourse by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses the strongest drop of the SBF 120 index in Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced that it had reduced by almost 20% its net annual profit forecast, reports traitors.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a revision, also announced a remand of its direction.
Several traitors reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It's clearly the profit warning of Nissan," said a manager of the trade in a Parisian court.
In the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4 per cent of Nissan's capital and 15 per cent of the Japanese manufacturer in France, according to Nissan's internet site data.
Greece: two dead in a fusion near a location of the neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was badly injured on Friday night by two shots of fire that were on the side of a motorbike that passed to a spot in the northern coast of Athens, a police source was learned.
The police were not able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political belonging.
Some Greek media reported that members of Aube Dore had supported the victims as guardians of their place.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorist police were stationed on the central Avenue of the Neo Iraqlio Bay, where the incident took place and the district was closed.
The incident takes place a few weeks after the conviction of six members of Aube Doree, including the leader and founder of the party, to participate in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against that party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's call denied
Scott Brown, the Captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his call rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club champions, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsived against the Barça to have addressed a couple of times to Neymar, the ecosystem saw its suspension at three meetings by UEFA.
In a communiqué, his club was said to be "very disappointed," believing that his call was completely justified.
Nearly 50,000 fires are free of electricity throughout the province, shortly after Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the river Saint-Laurent.
The most affected sectors are Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers in the dark, Monteregie with 13,464 and Outawai with 8642.
The large region of Montreal is also familiar with its stock of panels with nearly 7,000 private fireplaces in the Metropolis and Laval.
Do you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net benefits forecasts to increase and hopes for record results through Australian and United Kingdom vacations.
The travel agency is now expected to make a substantial profit over the entire period between $325 and $340 prior to tax, against a previous forecast of $305 to 315.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17 per cent of growth compared to the recorded profit of $290.4 M in 2011/12.
The Director-General, Graham Turner, said that the Flight Centre had made 8 per cent of the benefits of the first semester and that the second semester had begun to work, in particular with regard to travel other than business trips in Australia and the United Kingdom.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are well able to achieve record results on the whole of the year before the deduction of interest and tax,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest benefits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector re-entered during the second half of the month, which allowed the domestic market to be reimbursed for low-cost business travel.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has recorded good results while business customers have lost less.
Its office in the United States recovered its losses during the first semester where seasonal demand was lower and had to benefit from the entire period for the third consecutive period.
Flight Centre's operations increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people get on a hotel near Cairo's pyramids
Unknown strangers opened fire this Friday on a hotel close to Cairo's pyramids in Egypt without making any victims, resulting from a seemingly expensive request with licensed employees.
Assailants took the flight, explained the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, General Abdel Latif police.
This attack occurs when Egypt receives almost no tourists since the army has desecrated Islamic President Mohamed Morsi from July and suppresses in the blood the demonstrations of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the course of English literature, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a Roman of the 19th century, a Romance poem and a modern British fiction work from 1914 to our day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A combined literary and English language course will be deleted.
Since 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programmes tomorrow – the first subjects to undertake a radical review.
It will continue to make changes in other essentials next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Reviews Regulator, will launch a revision of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and less courses.
In the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was “a wide consensus on the need to reform our public review system in order to restore public confidence”, stressing that GCSE would be “more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during school year) than in most other countries.
Similarly, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singaporean students spend approximately 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more time to the use of time to the maths, close sources of the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of deep maths – as well as the greater importance given to the material in the international classes – would certainly encourage schools to provide more time for courses.
The programme will focus on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a legislative text adopted in July in this State, which is largely due to the right to abrogation, will be able to enter into force.
An octogenate welcomes children with a rifle at the Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were at the door to complain about the benefits of Halloween night.
One of the Rivers of the Muy area visited by the children opened the door by holding his helmet.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon has been seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trail, was actually buried in a common Jewish cemetery in Berlin, claims the director of the memory of the German resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive the end of the war.
"The bodies were buried in 1945 in a common courtyard of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he made sure on a day-to-day high-duty drawing by relying on records of archives.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would correspond to one of the great entities of the After-Guerre.
The German secret services, the BND, provided as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was located in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bill.
Secret services were totally misleading.
"In August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich by a command," according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general uniform."
"In the left-hand interior there were, in particular, its service states with a photo," he continued.
Bill also published a document from the district of Mitte in Berlin stating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is a nightmare of bad taste.
"A large crowd of people of the victims' memory," he woke up in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is part of the important personality of the Third Reich that has never been captured.
He participated in the Wansee conference in January 1942, which decided the "final solution" and, in particular, under his orders, Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the end of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Belle offers free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Belle and his team spend almost all their weekend watching hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, at least 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Belle is one of the 10 CNN Heros in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Tylle looked at his father's illness to change the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and to go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
James Bylle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematom that he would carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Tally.
We would have sent her abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bylle has spent years accompanying his father in clinics and clinics, so that he can get any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Belle.
You can leave home at 5:00, go to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Belle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor for 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio to the United States is 1 doctor for 413 residents.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two persons in five in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country's health costs are made in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Byble.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After seeing his father and so much of his suffering, Dr. Belle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Tylle and his volunteer team have practiced more than 700 surgical acts free of charge during the last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which takes place in rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly all salesmen, with a total of 30 people, try in supplies after having fixed medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult areas to get into the villages that have the most need for help.
The chance doesn't always follow them.
They have often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or boroughs.
But when they arrive, they are received in heroes: the community organizes a festival, song and dance and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Twelle – with his great smile and debatable energy – is more than happy to join the festivals.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people each visit,” said Mr. Byble.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is produced.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive cookies, a pair of collected moons or a free birth certificate – document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are generally practiced in a school, a palace or a house; after intervention, the patient rises up and goes into the living room to leave his seat with the next person.
Thanks to the clarification of the electronic group, the operating room and the sterilization of the material, Dr. Tylle and his volunteers work until the first hours of the morning.
It is an exciting rhythm, but the musicians of the villages generally help the team stay motivated.
“ They strike on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue working, ” said Mr. Tylle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, practiced 700 surgical acts free of charge during the last year, and he knows that their presence can make the difference for those who come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undertaken to care for a hernie would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and my family," said the man.
In addition to living in this travel hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Belle also works at night in private medical cabins around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private grants.
"I don't know when it hurts," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Dr. Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr.
He's always at the hospital or is trying to find money for his association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Tylle in his missions, it is an opportunity to learn about the field they do not have.
"We have been able to participate in operations to help prevent blood or to pass the instruments to Dr. Twelle," said Mrs. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are studying in medicine in the second year.
Volunteer students generally travel to Cameroon, and often come with the collected medical material.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, their transport and their education are carried out by Dr. Belle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not about to expand.
For Dr. Bylle, the relatively constant load of work is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” added Mr. Tylle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To laugh at people and ease their pain are the reasons that motivate me to do so.

The two France de Pierre Nora
Perplexes, university students have long been suffering from the definition and location of Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphitheaters and classrooms?
No doubt, but stressing his weakness for the paths of passage, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrary works in his Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
In fact, but by ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heritier of the falcon who employs Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Certain yet, but knowing that such a sacred one would not replace the true holy oil, the one of the the thesis, which he had done.
They volunteered to recognize him as a high-level, encouraging and federation of their work, but noting that he would show little interest in producing it himself.
In this uncertain picture the monument of "Memory Lieux", which he attached to his name, also contributed.
Moustic languages have been able to see a giant market for the poets, presented by an intelligent commenter, with a vibrating pair of eyebrows and earpieces of adjective, but unexplainedly sweet.
The two works published by Nora nearly two years ago have already established that the one who did not write had much and very well written.
The book here should definitely make him righteous.
However, once again there is the temptation of housing, intellectual vacancy, youth being put to sleep as one of the other's feet attached to the other.
However, it is quickly understood that the extraordinary objects collected in this book in such a beautiful title add the brochure to one and the same passion: to discover the constitutional node of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: it is a concern of time.
We have been invited to give a definition of it together.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders since then, the French identity was a temporary essence.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the case, compulsory Jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one who cares about Pierre Nora is everything else.
He does not inherit an eternal franity, he refuses to define.
Concerned analysis of a family's strangeness, it fails in a forest of symbols, stopped every time by an object in the form of a rebus, tortured by irritant questions.
What about the company itself: why, in a country where it is so permanently installed in its borders, if it is old-fashioned and strong-minded, are these dramatic calls for unity?
They are not so much pressure, Pierre Nora suggests, but in order to confuse the problem of the birth of the French history.
Frances and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourgignnons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most exemplary is of course the one who falls into two national historys.
From the Seismic of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarch, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without reaching the night; he was concerned about finding the sanctity and the more sensitiveness of unity and indivisibility that it had cut the head of the one who was evident and powerful incarnation.
And from there, a nation inevitably binary, divided between right and right, laity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueity of French identity, nothing is worth the four steps outside of Hexagon, although the American expedition of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one revolution, a rights statement, wants to establish a new society.
But American cosing makes it better to focus on what we are.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no interest in them anymore.
Here, men surrounded by an old Indian regime, and much more radical.
There's a consensus revolution when she's here to sow the drama and trust.
There are always proud founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors who are suffering from modelling, and who are of the rest intertwined.
There is an institutional constituencies, and here is a cascade of constitutions, such as the mistakes to be made and the attempts to recover.
France that's going, France that's coming
There was, however, a time when the French thought they could recover the broken clothes of their history and win the curse of the number two.
In this 3rd Republic, central and creative time, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who were then used to repair the revolutionary fraction, teaching the students everything that was secretly prepared for modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity was only a matter of time.
The voice again in the debate, driven by a new type of immigration, threatened by the amount of requisitionary minorities, is absorbed in the European area.
So the book offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes on and the cross-view of France that comes.
But first, he brought the story, which should have some surprises.
We found out that the truck was a married man.
The man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
It was located in the center of the center.
And the one who had deposited, over a half century ago, a subject on the idea of a nation, but was concerned about the initial exercise of the thesis, we are confident, as a green salis, that he will end by doing so.
Some in a less aggressive, more eclaign and more subtle form.
But we don't miss it, it's too heavy.
Because more than the figure imposed by the university course, this thesis tells us the internal need for a life.
An old office in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Born in Beirut on March 8, 1986, with three members of his "Antenne 2" team to film a show of Hezbollah, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Since 2008, he has been involved in the creation of the World Cup Defence Association, which he has held for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for candidates to submit complaints and to bring their perpetrators before the International Criminal Court.
After more than 1,000 days, the four days of Aqmi (Al-Qaida at the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrad and Marc Feret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grège Wednesday after noon, they were able to find their families.
And try, a little bit, to take the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former reporter, retired since 2008, the president of the "Otages of the World" association.
On the night of your release, you were on the 20th floor of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, at Beyrouth.
When I was released, I found myself in the trunk of a car where I met - without seeing it because it was black - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me that we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tired too.
It's war, and those who drive us are also very tired.
They put us on the sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the hotel Summerland where the press is present.
The French are escorting us to France's embassy.
It's time for parents, family, friends, press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And I've gone to France's embassy.
I also remember a short night to talk to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is always there because we don't have any means to get us out of Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
When we arrive at the helicopter, we are taken by a private plane that sails us to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua sails.
How did your arrival on the French soil come about?
We're landing at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible bottle.
And a lot of media.
When I was part of it, there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty of it.
The descent of the plane sculpture, you find them with my son and parents, my friend, all of this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and me, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
Motards take the fight to make photos and follow me to my house where I have to do some police to prevent some from mounting.
Mediatic pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is so hard to see.
We're out of a hole and we're all in the middle of the media.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to manage.
But we made it the hardest.
In the evening, I'm at 20 a.m., next morning I'm on the TV too.
It then begins a sort of adaptation to life, very kindly, for a month or two that are a little like vacations.
How have medical examinations and DGSE debriefing been conducted?
I had the right to a first medical check in Corse.
The rest was done in Val-de-Greed the following days: radios, examinations of all kinds and encounters with a psychiatrist.
This is not a session that does everything, but we know we can rely on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with information services.
They asked me questions about hostages.
It was logical.
I didn't think so.
How do you react, today, to the release of Niger's four days?
I hear what's said.
The debate on reasons, in particular.
Some things upset me, others less.
I'm trying to do the part between the issues of my past as an adult and my vice president's cascade of the "World's Otages" association that allows me to get away from it, and it seems to me much more interesting to approach.
I ask, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the arrest.
I think there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify for "political" adoptions - which is the case most of the time - and to enable the courts to have access to justice, to appeal and to bring their perpetrators to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, the whole world is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these moments.
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice?
A court in La Haye is done for that.
Why wouldn't we say to the adopters "you have broken the rules of war, like all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be founded, legitimized, struck with a good sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger grows in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of President Mohamed Morsi, they went down into the streets.
A movement throughout Egypt to claim the re-establishment of the first democratically elected president of the country.
This is not a trial that highlights this militar of the Muslim Brothers.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a trial.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial involving a pro-Morsi, who is intended to judge Sisi, not against him.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Masacres of Rabaa, the Massacres of Nahda, and the Massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
The police used lacrimogen gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested in Alexandria.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel calls on 9 American States to violate the rights of homosexuals
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military partners have the right to an identity card of the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with," the Minister in New York recalled in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to release these cards to spouses of the same sex in the facilities of the National Guard" on their territory, he said, calling on these States to violate federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these persons cannot benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases, or access to their stores.
The Secretary-General of the Defence said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The Front of the Nine States began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the implementation of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas Law and the Federal Law on Homosexual Marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a high responsibility of the Defence.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to about 5600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve and the Retracts.

In just 10 years, he has already won his place for European champions in Copenhagen this year, and he likes nothing more than to show it to competitors who are more than three heads.
The mayor of Toronto has come to ask about a drug deal
In Canada, Toronto's mother is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media.
A video delivered to justice seems to support these suspicions.
Interested, Rob Ford, has not always consumed crack, while acknowledging that he has a penchant for cannabis.

We also think that the images sometimes do not need an explanation or comment.
A rare case detected in a chat in the Val-d'Oise
On Thursday, 31 October, the authorities announced that a rare case had been detected in a chatton in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin, while France has been guilty of Aboriginal cases since 2001.
The chatton was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The race diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"A epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and carry out the persons who could have been in contact with this chat room between 8 October and 28 October," explains the Department of Health and Agriculture.
"Five persons who have been in contact with the cat have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"Man, the preventive treatment of the human race, administered after contact with the animal porter, but before symptoms appear, is very effective," the communiqué says.
The departments now call on persons who were injured, arrested, grifted, or injured on a mucus or on a skin afflicted by this cat or whose animal was in contact with that cat from 8 to 28 October to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 18 p.m. from 1 November.
"France has been in debt since 2001, this chatton or mother has been imported from another country, not indemnity," the report said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "autochtone" of the identified breed is reimbursed in December 1998 on a kidney and that "France is officially responsible for this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE)".
A row case on an illegal imports of Gambia had been registered in 2008.
"Range is a fatal disease if it is not treated in time," reminds the departments and is transmitted for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease occur.
Obama goes back on his reform of the health system
Under a review of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his promise without ambiguity and often repeated according to which “if you are satisfied with your health system, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received feedback from their suppliers, the Republicans criticised the president during the last days as he accused the American people of fraud.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have a health insurance that they can keep," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he called "a modern fervance" on solutions, President Obama urged the Americans who received this advice to seek new market insurance.
Most people will be able to obtain full and better health schemes for the same price, even less expensive than planned.
"You're going to win," he said.
The Administration stated that it should not be surprising if 5 per cent of the people who had contracted their own insurance were forced to change the regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me direct my attention to these Americans: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius when witnessing to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, pointed out that the launch of the online market in October had failed to "failfully".
"I'm as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.
I should have restored your trust.
It is a Kathleen Sebelius exaggerated who uttered this phrase, while she believed her micro cut, addressing an assistant behind her at the meeting of the Assembly yesterday following a exchange of points of view with Billy Long, a representative of the Republic of Missouri, in order to know if she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has not stopped asking Ms. Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up the insurance paid by the government to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which now goes to millions of Americans.
Vettel has a special case for Abu Dhabi
The hero, Jake Vite Prekok, combined the colors of the car brand and German team, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, a champion of Formula 1 World Championship, has trained for the free trials of Abu Dhabi's Grand Prix, a special case where the design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 designs sent worldwide, in the form of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of its glory.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore be seen near the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel had to carry this box on Friday and Saturday, to try.
It is likely that there will be another special case on Sunday, for the course, to mark its 4th world title consecutively.
A resident of Auberviliers launchs his Part of the Banley
We don't make mistakes, especially.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Part of the Banley" is not only addressed to the bankers.
I've chosen a map of France as a logo, just justify it.
When I'm talking about bananas, I'm addressing all those who are excluded from the big national family.
It does not prevent, in its project, presented Thursday at a press conference in Aubervillier's native community, from being born with the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural potency that characterizes all districts.
My proposal n°1 is to create a department of multiculturalism, i.e.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, is now known as "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 on the side of Jean-Pierre Chevénement, then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know very well that the values of equality I apply in my programme are cut to the left but if the right people are willing to support me, I will also listen to them, continue to do so.
There's only the extremists I don't talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune built his program -consultible on the Internet - from many topics intended to speak to the residents of the neighborhood, including young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority of 16-year-olds, the rehabilitation of the property guard function...
There are still candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this risk of being just, acknowledge it."
It's a matter of time and money.
The Banley Party should even be represented in Aubervilleers through my application and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that there are already seven heads of lists in the Metropolitan and Martinique France.
"It's the support mail I've received since yesterday not all of the gang members" he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, without prior permission, that the American spying was "too far away in an inappropriate way"
John Kerry pointed out a reduction in the defence attitude of the United States with regard to its monitoring programmes, without prior consenting that, on several occasions, the spying "was too far away in an inappropriate way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had been on "automatic pilot" when he saw a series of fire-fighting events from the spokesman Edward Snowden on NASA's spying activities on the day.
The refugees placed the U.S. government in the centre of a diplomatic storm with their allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is unthinkable that the President, myself and other members of the government have been aware of some things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States Government to admit that the American spy had exceeded the bars, but stressed that the rights of each had not been violated.
He stated: “In some cases it has gone too far in an inappropriate way.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to the people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one would be misled.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, stressed that the NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are living in a new world where people are willing to make sacrifices. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, exploit them and attack governments.
What if you can intercept their communications and stop them before they do?
We were well and well prevented from sleeping planes, explosives, and people being killed because we could have learned about facts in advance.
Meanwhile, American legislators will be in Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged American spying business and convince Europeans that the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States has been explained yesterday by the Vice-President of the Senate on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he had expressed himself to the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had experienced regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorism organizations from the sense of frustration caused by the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment to combat terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first mandate, and the Vice-Commission on European Affairs of the United States of America, during an interview since Washington.
And I am going to go to Europe to help them understand that we must continue working together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NASA programmes.
The press reports that NASA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with certain United States allies, but the agency's director said this week that it was unfair and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about the metadata that NATO alliances had collected and shared with the United States.
Other findings have been made of documents published by Snowden that the NSA has received data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other Heads of State.
The Information Services Director, James Clapper, justified the exposure of allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was an ongoing practice on both sides.
In this tense atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a tour of Congress, which should take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and two rooms.
The names of other participating legislators should be deleted in the future.
He indicated that the timetable was still to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to prove "afflictive closure".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programmes they have been applying for themselves for years.
"We can modify our surveillance programmes in order to better protect European rights, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world to do the spying," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to make this weekend in the Middle East and Poland to manage the savings generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as United States monitoring activities.
The London Bourse closed down on Thursday, struck by the bad results of Shell and the next day by the Federation of Maintenance in the state of its support to the economy, as planned.
An Australian calling for his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver, called the trial and was released.
First, Stevie Rochelle Bamford was convicted by a Phuket Province Tribunal on 15 June of false statements after he told the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who had mastered him, had attacked him on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after being separated from her small Australian friend.
Phuket's police questioned Bamford for two days before she discovered the history of all the rooms.
She was detained in a cell of the local commission before hearing before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre in the Phuket Periphery rather than in a women's prison.
It is about the daughter of the former player of the Australian Association ofrugby Peter Tunks, who called the Department of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "very worried" about her daughter's welfare and wanted her to come to Australia.
“ We have obviously had a pleasant time, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible, ” said Tunks.
Bamford appealed to the trial and was released after a ban on 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that while waiting, she was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai legal sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but prevented the appeal from resulting in a penalty relief that could go to prison for up to two years and imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to reverse its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to a acquisition.
The French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters as well as the RSCA's cars.
The French police decided to impose strict rules on the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germany fixed Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, the spokesman of the Brussels-midi police area, Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who want to attend this meeting of the League of Champions will be required to use the transfer system set up by the SRC.
"The bus ride will be escorted by the police from an old Reek border post to the PSG station," the spokesman passed.
The procedure will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to return to Paris by means of other means, the French police prefecture had revealed that measures had been taken to allow for arrests to be carried out," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Committee, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
That is what motivated, one year ago, to consult with parents, students, teachers and members of education staff, to think about ways to better integrate students living on horses between different cultures.
The school commission has just opened up its vision of "Live together in French".
The Vision diversity organization has been moving for a year in schools to help students of all origins discover common references that do not limit themselves to French.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are repertoires.
Large names of writers, artists, whether they're soybeans or they're from others.
Who are our builders?
"So, we create projects so as to identify themselves in all of this," explains the President of Vision diversity, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the New World Institute, identified several challenges for the school committee.
"For example, on the transmission of what Quebec culture is, the feeling of belonging, the support to staff in the transformations we live in, within the student client," he said.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has set up a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who, at times, come from others.
Rachida Azdouz, University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"From different pedagogical strategies, this is the real need," she said.
Research will include all its English: language, school, social and cultural.
