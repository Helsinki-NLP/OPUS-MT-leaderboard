Prague Bolsa ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the early fall in the morning, Prague's Bolsa corrected its losses.
ČEZ’s transactions achieved approximately half the value they had on a normal day.
The Prague Bolsa, at the beginning of the commercial March, immediately responded to the fall of the moon when it fell to around 6 per cent.
The downing of this time is due to the fall of the actions in Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives, which was refused to support the Stabilization Plan of the Secretary of the Financial Sector, is also expressed here.
Debt of action in Asia
The Asian Bolshevik actions were a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although during the day the index was finally part of the losses.
Hong Kong’s Hong Kong’s Hang Seng’s index during its financial year marked almost four percent, although later it was slowing down its losses by reducing the drop in practically 2.5 percent.
The index of Hang Seng China Enterprises that followed the movements of Chinese actions in Hong Kong Bols decreased by 3.8 per cent, the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Sidney's actions lost more than five percent, but in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan's Bolsa, according to the Secretary of the Index, declined to 3.6 per cent.
"The rescue actions planned in the United States are insecure and this affects the financial market all over the world," said the Chief of the Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Jam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
American legislators should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
In other words, it threatens that disasters will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the U.S. Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system assistance plan, which should be devoted to $700 billion (about 12 billion) per month.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, American actions lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of actions collected the biggest drop in over 20 years.
Dow Jones' index fell to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index came down before it was announced but soon it was shown that the assembly's proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
The Congress withdraws: U.S. Government can inject $700 billion in the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and Government, President George W. Bush, agreed in a contract in broad terms to provide financial assistance to the American financial system.
Its vote will take place at the beginning of the next week.
American legislators have led to a break in the discussions on the adoption of the ransom plan in their form of assistance to the US financial system with the amount of $700 billion (about 12 billion)
However, it is still not won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and be voted.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed Monday in the Conference of Representatives.
He told Reuters, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before the Wednesdays.
According to economists, the arrival of the settlement plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalisation of the financial market.
Then, however, it will come to "sustainment" thanks to the complex mechanisms which will also help the market.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We resolve our discrepancies with regard to how to have the package of measures for market stabilization," said Democrat Nancy Pelosia to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give him a final form to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial companies non-sale mortgage assets that lead to losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It is necessary to continue with the health plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis has an extremely rapid impact on the market of fast-growing actions.
According to Senator Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing all they can to make Congress finally agree this Sunday.
They therefore want to calm the business of investors in the Asian finance market because they are those found in the first house and where Congress could influence the trade of the moon.
However, there is no clear certainty at this time about when the two cameras of the American Congress will vote and even if they are not at the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe that it will be adopted in the coming days.
The law, however, will suffer a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme was not fulfilled, which would be made of another $100 billion and later of the latest $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may vote in favour of this decision, but Congress can overcome his vote by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was maintained that was to gain financial resources for the recovery of mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked all.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator, Judge Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of the Sabbath and that it is worth "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Delimitation of the covered contract
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the legislators had decided on the responsibility of the programme for the protection of the taxpayers of their losses, a flexible closure of the programmed funding plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called closed contracts for directors of participating companies of the programme and establish a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also deals with helping owners of houses who have problems with their payments.
The Government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments that it purchases in order to reduce the monthly charges of payments at the time of the debtor and allow them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's chief economist, David Marek, a good idea that will be carried out but quite difficult.
"And that's why we don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets will buy.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
That the plan is now adopted or at the beginning of the next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"A lot more important is that, this week the congressmen agree on their support and on their good sight before they can.
This important and psychological agreement that comes to this approval is, at these times, the most important," Marek insisted.
Hand-held fight: MP3 Player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile player plays MP3 files, no MP3 player is able to make calls.
What seems to be obvious is that it's better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for the man to get only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult to acquire the latest toys to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP discs are no longer coming out, and as regards their quality, there is no one objective reason to continue to buy them.
If you dig in your estuaries the vinyl discs with art rock, jazz or blue music, you are probably dreaming at least with this type of toca discs.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are categories of prices and quality.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as for a lovers of Pink Floyd who will find it difficult to test the market caches of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, including enough space for each one.
The choice is wide.
Also determines the duration of the battery
Some of the best players achieve much more than just playing music and even that which is not even most mobile.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most important functions such as telephoneing, sending messages, playing music and video, recording the two, has a better or worse camera and until you can navigate.
And when we take into account the Smartphone and the PDA are going to have a small computer in their pocket as well.
This is a small miracle because no one can make a mirror and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disappointment.
More functions are used on the mobile before the screen indicator is recharged.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy tracks.
Few are the mobiles that can play music more than ten or ten hours, most of which are much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest) have a clearly greater performance.
Therefore, take into account that cheap mobiles will not play more than two hours.
In addition to this, above all, they constantly call themselves still, for more safety, a loader for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the poor will wait at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem is recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices have a universal USB connection and, in addition, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some reading units without a reduction can connect the small memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
In the players, with any exception (iPod), no special software is required.
It's enough to fill the device with music via USB on your computer.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the musical library according to the name of the interpreter, title of the album, gender or even user rating.
Some devices only show a tree structure directory similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Player is trying to use, mobile knows more
For the selection of a specific team concerned by the resistance of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its management.
If you listen, above all, the music as a background and you're going to listen to it every day just a few times, like in the trajectory, then it's enough with any mobile that's playing.
What actually gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays music.
MP3 plays it all and, practically, almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
Most of the most extensive are found and except for him, the absolute majority of the devices play music in the WMA format.
The minimum includes the AAC format (the format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobiles also enable, for example, online music purchases.
Just through the mobile Internet to visit the operator’s competent pages (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could only be a weight argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited to the themes of successful flight of radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this kind of music sale (whether via GSM, internet or wireless) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a cell phone.
If you like to listen to something, you'll find the cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always get earphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has practically every mobile, even if at least one MP3 player is.
The biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will probably be your price.
The lowest prices usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classical aureculars.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as telephones equipped with an input of 3.5 mm for classical aureculars, cost up to five thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really manages them all.
The minimum functions, their management, similar to the previous current boxes or also to the touch discs are evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we are connected to the Internet with the mobile and therefore giant account for low data.
For which device to decide
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g., Vadaphone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even the purchase of an appropriate card will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
Basic models are usually equipped only with a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive have an 8 GB memory.
If you already have a cell phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, you'll have a meal in Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (as a maximum of 2 GB) no more than 1,100 crowns need to be spent.
If it is considered among the most desirable lovers of music, the hand of the most specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles on the walkman line are almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (normally 15 hours, with maximum performance up to 35 hours), would lead MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will be arriving this year in the Czech Republic.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still need something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
He probably won't be late.
That Czech operators are part of Europe's most expensive, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed the Czech Telecommunications Office (CHEC) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive of all the Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming rates regulation, it is likely to be a paradox situation - for some mobile mobile operators sending SMSs from abroad will be cheaper than sending them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking competence that really wants to fight.
This is probably paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and its high coverage is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is an extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CHEC), Pavel Dvorák, also expressed that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It may be true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Exactly the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market led to a high drop in prices, which the classic operators should also react.
At the same time, even before the entrance of Tyburons such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the Great Britain market, similar voices were heard there as well as here.
There has been evidence that there is room for this type of operator and that they can be successful.
On the other hand, there is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we inform you about the star of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Only after a year or so, this operator was able to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group that, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is in the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
In addition, to enable them to operate effectively, they are enough with many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators are usually characterized by low costs - they offer cheap calls and messages that, however, often contrast with the most adjusted service offer.
Thus, for example, mobile Tesco in Britain offers SMS at least half the cost of competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good hit for a non-trivial target group.
This operator is specifically addressed to the man.
"The right man chooses Mobileling - is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if it seems as if Poland could fail in our country.
There is no doubt that Vodafone's portfolio, Miroslav Čepicý: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments where most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services is relatively satisfactorily satisfied"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in R. Checa does not seem too promising.
Rather, it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," he said in a telephone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničkova, the manager of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly he made sure that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows him the GTS Novara group that wants to take a step forward to become a real O2 telephone competition in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in it, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile phones.
And so much before, better.
With this possibility we have found us again with all Czech mobile phone operators.
With some of them we have made progress at the meetings," said the group spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Well, maybe they're spending better time.
It seems that, with informal information, the first official operator would have to reach the end of the year.
But now your appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At these moments we believe that the situation is ideal for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
To this day no one has been directed to us with some complex and serious project in this field," he said for mobile.cz, Vlastimil Sršön, spokesman for Phone O2.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
The portable T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in accordance with the O2 opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that can, bilaterally, continue to develop."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied in so short a time."
Vodafone focuses on compliance with the own requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this is about the distribution of costs and infrastructure.
We consider it precisely as the greatest contribution from the customer point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the company with whom to set up a shared network for a quick internet on the mobile."
Offices responsible - with oven and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition, which would lead to a low price decline and thereby a decline in profits.
Then why facilitate access to competition?
When operators want to get something, they're able to pull from the same rope, proof of it is the arrival when U:phone came out.
Maybe the biggest pressure on ČTU was at the time of U:phone entry by T-Mobile society.
It certifys publicly available information on the ČTU website.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, not much has been done that the competitive environment in the mobile telephone market was opened to a quarter operator.
With regard to the character of the mobile telephone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would be subject to him and, above all, to his large requirements."
That is why this access to mobile operators is extremely disappointing because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This is purely the Office for the Protection of Commercial Offers (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position before this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after a contract on the purchase of the infrastructure required between a mobile phone operator and a virtual operator is closed.
To date, no agreement has been closed because the offer of the potentials concerned more well was not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," he added our Christian Chalupa question, from the UOHS Department of External Relations.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices to be represented by consumer interests, it is more than a consideration, but it must be noted that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristin Chalupa adds: "In the foreign place where virtual operators operate normally we can note that their market entry has contributed to the low prices of mobile telephone services"
Clearly, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market resources and the low prices do not fall within the interest of the UOHS.
It is truly dramatic in all this case that the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence is offered by itself.
It is the same as the gas price in the gas pipelines because it is clear that it is a work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators therefore have a dominant position without a corresponding rise in responsibility in their market actions.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephone market to virtual operators, however, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
There is clearly an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTU according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of the commercial offer.
In this type of market, of course none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - in order for a virtual operator to emerge, it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a concrete segment it must be essential to dominate.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS should be a warning that three mobile operators appear in a similar manner.
The current complaints of stakeholders (including the so-called GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with operators, there are many similar obstacles.
The burden of responsibility in ČTú is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications in which the UOHS washes hands in all this matter.
We've already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecoms law was recently introduced to expand ČTU's competence in the field of non-impact commercial tenders, even when a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
This must be well known by the representatives of UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are on the other side.
It's all right, when no one sees.
At the same time, it is undisputedly still working something as well as a pseudovirtual operator that is already in the Czech mobile phone networks.
They are companies that place their own prices on mobile telephone services that, however, are only a part of the public.
It is usually a business that is dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few selected ones get the price list from these companies.
Magic is in which the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same company, carrying a large amount of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all mobile phone checks operators prohibit this type of return.
"If cases such as those mentioned could be found in the terms of the contract that could be translated into the end of cooperation with the given society," Martina Kemrová answered the question on this issue.
But it is quite unlikely that an activity of this type carried out by mobile telephone operators will not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three mentioned companies, thousands of customers can be treated.
None of the operators are opposed to this procedure.
With the activities of these companies, they gain nothing and, at the same time, contrary to the genuine virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows a speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are used only by a dissertation of as many as a hundred customers.
These should also accept that the SIM card of your phone is not your name because they can't make it absolutely available to you as a normal client of the operators."
This is precisely what it should look like to the ČTU at least foreign.
There is also a new question for UOHS.
If mobile phone operators are around their eyes in this kind of procedure, why are they blocking the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to find out this type of activity and that if it does not wish, it should not be satisfied with the explanation of operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not permit it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As already clearly stated in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brings a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, practically in all countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried to protect themselves from this interruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, possibly too satisfactorily, problems with service quality, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened at these times and none of the cases have defended their operators but their clients.
Without formal measures or informal pressure, they had achieved that the first virtual operator would arise and with him they began to arise more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory body all of this happens as if it were dealing with a key burning.
Through our experience, we cannot stop being impressed that the confusion of the duties in these cases is in agreement with them.
But we don't despair.
If this information between passengers is correct and the virtual operator really comes to these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is probably starting to move again.
If any of the operators leave to enter any virtual mobile phone operator, it will be difficult for UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling dearer than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech ensemble has four new versions.
Best Ellipse
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official institution.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the day of the Czech official celebrations, presented the new official record of the Donde Himmno, my home.
The new himno recorded him at the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - two versions that are solos, one male voice and the other female voice, the other with Core and another instrument.
Part of the encargan Caterina Knežinkova y Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the divine arrangements are Otakar Jeremiaháš and Jaroslav Krček.
The iHNed.cz server can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this national Czech song as one of the most beautiful gods.
Radio Checa has already said that he deliberately chose for the solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both and then, also with the Coro to rely on the speech so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be consensual," he said.
The official Czech hammock celebrates the next year of the 175 anniversary.
The song Donde, my home was first sung in 1834 at the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetan Tyl and arranged with the music of Frantisšek Skroup.
He made popularity and people did his thing.
The first strode of the song after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918 was naturally converted into a part of the official institution.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the birth of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hemno sounds
Prague's MHD takes us the miracle for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company on the date when the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at these moments by almost a hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
The passengers can buy the 30-day bonus, 90-day bonus and the year (will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the information centres and transport companies at the Metro stations, Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andel, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kacherov and Luka.
Bonas can already be purchased from the Internet on the transport company’s pages, www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred people until evening.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about ticket sales at metro stations, where they have to do it regularly to get a normal ticket.
The bonus is bought online, and the Opencard card is recharged in one of the three branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a room for passengers with staff prepared to help interested parties with the purchase by the Internet and also with the recharge of the goods purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrní.
In addition to the library, it will also be possible to reload the electronic bonus on the Opencard in the automatic machine that is located in some metro vis-à-vis.
How are these expensive machines?
They're red, they remind us of a ticket picker machine and the passengers are probably already located at Roztyly, Budéjoviká, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now in the city five but at the end of the year there should be eight," Opatrní completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just by entering it the opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will only be loaded into it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the traffic trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that are mainly used by the residents of central Bohemia.
"In the trains assigned to the integrated transport of Prague there are auditors equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and zone of the bonus," he explained the control of tickets, Filip Drapal of the Ropid organization, which sets out the hours of the collective transport of Prague.
Circulation buses have their reading cards mounted in the driver's pocket.
Upon entering it it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard in the place to which it is intended on the side of the Caja.
With that, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonus there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drapal concluded.
Passengers who do not travel on the buses and do not remember when they finish the validity of the bonus can be directed to the forwarding machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be presented with information about the validity of your document.
Southeasts wanted to form part of the U.S. in a referendum
In 1945 the Germans asked that fumaba be a part of the United States.
This is what is drawn from the letter stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the pattern of the United States of America.
With this desire, some groups of Germans from the South were apparently directed to the President of the United States in 1945.
The result of the cards that are stored in a particular file and that are stored today in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the American President that does not allow the return of the "Sumava Land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again in Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want to say that the American units are coming to German lands not as persecutors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with "the people who carry the destiny of Shumava in their hearts."
In view of the fact that the association of Czechoslovakia with the southern Germans is likely to suggest - according to these Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disconsideration, incompetence, pressure and slavery, the authors cry out in the letter to the American President who is taking over for today and for all time to Shuva under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million people, it gives us a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that it is actually working with the victory of allies," says the letter.
The reason why the authors can't sign is that the fear of repressives from the "cheek oppressors".
If the U.S. President was likely suspicious of this idea of the Germans, it would be sufficient to organize a referendum on whether their citizens want to be part of the U.S. or to live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of the postwar history, can sound a little childish, according to some experts, carefully paints the expectations of the Germans of the south-east.
Although the Czechs had to at least suggest that they were to be dealt with about their expulsion from the Republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudan in a clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budéjovice.
This was in the war, as German of Buddejovice, en route to the Baltic Sea.
When the war ended, the British captured him and placed him in the Holstein prison camp for decades of Germans were there to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when I came home, the check would come well," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, he said, were aware that, on the basis of the Benes Decrees, they would be expelled from the Republic.
Don't think--pay!
Emotional campaign against drivers
The most direct action in Czech history directed to safety on the streets.
In this way, the emotional campaign that decided to launch the Wednesdays of the Ministry of Transport in the media could be characterised.
The Minister's office, Aleš Rébeček, promises that it will weaken the drivers of dangerous conduct at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and on booklets.
It would have to discourage the driver of high speed and alcohol from flying.
And also to remind them that before they go on, the belts are drawn.
He wants to reach consciousness above all of the young drivers, motorists, ketones and finally professional drivers too.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that empathize with emotions.
And for that we are witnessing the announcements "sanguaries" throughout the campaign:
Don't think--pay!
The word "Don't think" is written with great letters in the matrix.
And in a blood bag is the word "pagas."
This must symbolize that a man at a time of despair can come to pay with his own life.
The announcements are going to be "fearful" to the spectators by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Angolan lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be observed.
You promise that this will reduce accidents and deaths in Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and lead for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and milk system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a sweater passes in red and thus saves time.
The bear is threatened by an accident.
The drivers should be reminded of the risks," says hospital psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
And that's why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly a negative publication, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is a panel installed warning of any danger, it will probably be merged with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all the areas occupied in exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the restoration of practically all the land occupied in 1967, namely, Cisjordania, Jerusalem this and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
I proposed in the interview that the moon appeared in the journal Jedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily restore almost all the lands (employed) if it is not all," said Olmert in the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll stay with a hundred of these lands, but we'll have to send the Palestinians a hundred similar (from the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of a return, Jerusalem would also be included.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want the tractors or excavators to pass on their feet as he passed by one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out regarding the two July attacks in the city where several dead and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the President, it will be necessary to find "a special solution to the Temple hill, a sacred and historical place" located inside the ancient city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted ahead.
Removed from the Golan Highs
Olmert also announced that Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Highlands is an inexhaustible condition to conclude a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to learn to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with the Hizbul (Chita Movement), they will have to learn from the permanent support of Hamas (Chita Movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the bus bus cars illegal?
The law is unknown, can't walk on a long-distance bus
In relation to the tragic accident of the bus from the Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises whether the bus can be moved by the bus during the trip.
"If we wish to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of the Azafata are contrary to the law of violent transit," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The incident in which he died last week at the age of twenty years was evidently caused by the driver of the truck only when the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure location of the vehicle despite having reservations from two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly freeze, and at the right time the elevator distributes the coffee or periodicals.
Here's what's playing the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with foot-and-mouths.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buss of Student Agency do not have places to go on foot, as confirmed by the company director, Radim Jančura, at Aktualnn.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers could go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have seating," he commented.
The Asaphata doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the Asaphate - no legal provision makes this function clear.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from carrying out any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of the vehicle auditor, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds, less secretly, the porter Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Traffic by Road by the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorní, considers that the law is sufficiently concerned with this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have foot-and-mouth sites.
That's all," she says.
The buses are divided between the cities, where there are sites to be foot and maximum speed, interurbans with foot stations with a higher speed permit and long distances without foot walking, with the highest speed permit and with seating equipped with safety belt.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP expert in transport safety, Jaroslav Horín, has no significant problems with the movement of azaphate in the bus.
"In the course of the development of the journey there is no risk, the situation can be compared to service on aircraft.
Even here there is the security that turbulence comes and that the azafata can be hit in the head."
"However, if the bus obviously brakes the physical laws are valid.
The same as in a urban bus or in the tramway.
Azafata's safety must be resolved by the carrier's internal rules," he also believes that this problem is not solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter offering the Azaftas service.
He employs hundreds of them.
The Director, even after the accident, considers this work to be abandoned.
"However, at the moment you have the impression that the place of Azafata is abandoned, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers when they come in.
I would even save costs," he says.
In the interest of security is the reason that Asia is missing from its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have breaths, we've been against them since the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
There was a terrible tragedy
In the incident of the line one in Naples, a young woman from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably drove from the station car blocking the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried to prevent him in a quick manner, but he shot at the right side of the front.
Jančira refuses to sell the two sites that are reserved for azafata rest.
"These sites can't be booked for long distance connections, they're blocked."
The company intends to request the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the verdict on the compensation of the girl's family but also waits for the financial costs of the offender.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could lead to a greater accuracy on the movement of the bus in which 30 experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, no concrete conclusion has been reached.
They do not devote too much to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed in the bus and the use of the mobile during the trip," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the Azafts to be an important threat to passenger safety," concluded the porter Hanzelka, that road safety control is the responsibility of the police and the Office of the Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported in Frankfurt
In the letter of the West LB Bank's Board of Directors, there are no great words left for its employees.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank units with the DEKA bank can form a central capital market for the financial group of Sparkassen', as the letter says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the 'competence block' with sustainable profits capacity, would enter such a business.
In addition, such mergers can be a starting point for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is how the text is understood when a joint directive wants to show the ability to act in difficult times.
Because just as the West LB was first found under a huge pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services that has recently made it clear to the Government of the North-Westphalia Renania that it is a short time to find a solution.
It has been a long time since, also from the part of Frankfurt, it has been talking much about such a union between the DEKA bank, which the customers of Sparkasse know about their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after an average year at the end of August, let him know that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on the Mainzer Street street, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
However, the DEKA Management Board, which is now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen's associations, has agreed to initiate negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or some parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, as is stated on the financial page.
This is not the first time that it is about consolidation in the area of Sparkassen, the name of the DEKA bank appears that with its 3000 employees, it is one of the most important entrepreneurs on the Francfort financial site.
In 2003, the situation looked as if the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was without results.
As soon as plans were made public, the Government of Hesse expressed its opposition to the participation of Helaba in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the Renania-Palatinate Regional Bank initiated dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg Regional Bank.
But it always played again with the idea of the DEKA bank merger with other regional banks.
But for the last time Günther Merl, President of the Helaba Board of Directors, expressed his opposition to the plans of co-existence with his bank.
Depending on this, it seems more clear that the Union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
So when the elections of the Bavarian parliament are over, BayernLB's union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure continues to increase, Helaba will need the partners to do so.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although it has so far exceeded the financial crisis that the real estates of Stuttgart and Munich have done so much better.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which holds 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year, avoided the co-existence plans with the West LB.
In any case, only the North LB is left.
But such geostrategic reflections are just one part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, so that Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has not yet given any answers.
In the end, West LB can be decomposed, but that, of course, is not the bank's own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the Bank's Board of Directors, it is said that there would be an attempt to find a complete solution for the whole bank.
As the co-existence between individual parts of the bank with the DEKA is possible, that will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena's the first time, for Luca's the third or fourth time.
But this time, he's seen Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, on the side of a 5-litre barrier of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge tiger showing almost 200 participants in Oktoberfest who sound low knows to produce in his garage.
First Elena gave Luca a piece of candy, then a drink.
They came from Bolonia to Verona.
From there, from parking on the side of the train station Porta Nuova, this night at 23:45 three buses, `Munich direction, the festival of beer', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the parking corners on the side of their flag are singing the Americans, they have already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, Marco Guarda says, which is nothing for the Italians.
To Marco, who wears a long suit with an artificial leather fort and gloves with silver-colored patillas, these buses belong to him.
For five years they have come to October, bearing in mind that there are only three trips this year.
From midnight on the way there, during the day in the beach, at 22.30 a.m.
To spend the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made under the law of the purity of the Baviera, disease insurance and guide in Germany - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on their way to the highway with the "Brennero" address.
There's no brain, not yet.
Soon the queen's quiet in the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
He went to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian matrices take another break in the 8th car just before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the planned arrival at 6.30 p.m. in the parking lot along the Beach of Teresa, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last talk on how to proceed.
First: put a yellow shirt on us.
There, on the left hand side it is written "Oktoberfest", on the left side in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the Internet: "conscersiviaggingo.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign store are opened, that means march!" cried Marco in the morning.
"Mark!" marked and occupy the back places in the camp shop.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all of you don't sit in the same bathroom, scattered all over space!"
A beer litre, red Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the property
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
Just get out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third, "This afternoon exactly the tenth and the average you have to get here!" Did you understand?
And now they're all going to October.
One, to mark the road, up to the yellow hills in the trees, traffic signs, and even in a cartel of the elections of a great People's Party of Bavaria.
You want to be able to recognize the path behind you.
It is the second weekend of Octoberfest known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; it is estimated that 50,000 people travel on the Alps, and that they are unfortunately entering camp stores, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend in Italy.
The Munich police receive assistance from seven police officers from the Bolzano Autonomous Province, Italian volunteers assist the Baviera Red Cross that makes statistics of the present nations, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, are in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and Austrians are taking the first place.
The favorite store of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
The Nights Without Sleeping for the Believers of the Real Estate Hypo
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, emphasised only last week by Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück.
Well, that policy would use the word "relevantly" and added that the German banking area would also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate fund, which is quoted in the DAX index, receives from a German bank consolidated a billion-dollar credit to be able to withstand disturbances on the market.
On Monday a person who knows the situation well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Real Estate Hypo is going to use has to throw interest.
The money comes from private banks as well from public law.
The cause is the losses of the Defa branch.
According to a report, state finances with the money that was provided for long-term projects had only been financed for a short time - which is now due to market mistrust.
In the first half of the year, the bank's capital reserve actually fell by a 95 per cent, EUR 2.37 million, and the share of the capital itself dropped slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
In comparison with the same period of the year, the continued income of financial investments and net benefits of financial operations fell to zero, the income tax on debtors and certain securities also declined from the disposal of credit business supplies by more than 70 per cent, in EUR 5 million.
Only due to the high and many revenues from the reimbursement of the restructuring costs of the former Defa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and organised business for the companies of the corporation, the negative balance could lead to a deficit of approximately 16 per cent more.
Following its privatization in 1990 the former state finances were initially lost in speculations with industrial loans for the real estate, which served as a reason for the establishment of the Aareal Bank.
As much money could not be earned with the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensely to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was differentiated.
Now the Real Estate Hypo has to do amortizations on the value of the branch that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of the group's losses and gains, it is said very accurately.
It's a fact that the dividends have canceled.
For 2007 they were cancelled by two thirds.
Following the acquisition of the Defa, the Real Estate Hypo became an important state-of-the-art financial and financial asset in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own client deposits, it, compared to other banks, becomes more dependent on the refinancing on the interbank market.
With the US Investment Bank's headquarters Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the grant of interbank loans was essentially low because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year, the Real State Hypo needs almost EUR 50 billion to finance a portion of the Defa's short-term credit card for its refinancing measures.
According to the report of Hippo Real Estate, the bank covers with a credit the need to finance the group for a short time and the company is assured that "the influence of international monetary markets which are now largely inadequate to operate"
Other sources say that, thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, President of the Royal State Hypo Directive, explained that the Real Estate Group Hypo would not need monetary markets for the expected time.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Financial Services Monitoring Institute (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Real Estate Group from now on is ensured.
That has to wait for shareholders and bank creditors.
But because of the dynamics and the impunity of the crisis, there is no constantness.
It is also unlikely that funding should not be needed in its full volume.
But the case cannot be excluded.
I voted in favour of the fact that the bank was still almost insolvent in the last hour of the Sunday, so temporary salvation can also not calm down at least the people concerned.
The share price fell to 75 per cent, EUR 3.30.
The rates of loans, on the contrary, are really good.
While the priority debt is almost unchanged, the rates of loans according to the position in the property register are clearly below.
In particular, the loans of the former Württemberg Hypo branch are affected and due to the loans whose profits are based on 2009.
Following the remarkable rise in the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Defa affected by the Real Estate mortgage, the current value of its loans that were previously investment for speculation should be considered as a result of the stability of the international financial system.
While the embankments, governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, so far can be derived from the amortisation of pensions within a period of time.
Or it's going to happen, something that no one can imagine-- the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But when we saw the news on partial stasis, the security that is now within its limits became a justified hope.
That will be a reason, because the believers will spend the night without sleep, breaking their head on the decision on their enthusiasm.
In the short term investors can still put the end point and use transport to re-account for losses for future tax payments of compensation for change in the future.
Sylvana and Bent's secrets?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to appear at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to cry: "German is completely "kawaii!"
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she has in Japan.
"The first day in a college in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to college, I was scared.
I live on the Tokyo border in Kawasaki and I'm on train 40 minutes to High School Tachibana.
All I had to do was find the way, and I'm sure I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of the classes has not been established as strictly as in my home, in Bada Sajonia.
From eight in the morning the students came, at least twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before I started the class, I was touched to introduce myself.
Moreover, I am not a person who speaks very well in public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, they put me an old-fashioned mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue caps and black skin shoes.
So, this dress put me in the pocket and I try to say everything in the right way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I'm Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and in a week I'll be my maids.
At this point he was very happy because he had started to study this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have closed, refused and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew my Mangas.
That belongs to the Japanese girl's survival vocabulary and means "Mona, beautiful"
Then I quickly disappeared from my place.
The girl on the side had a big smile for her, it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when I heard the gang, I felt really embarrassed.
Everyone spoke at the same time, talked and asked many questions - at the same time it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
And then at the reception, everyone took off his Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else that's broken pieces of German bread.
He had rice with herbs, small salads, pepper salad and algae, fruit and something like meat in the table of Tofu.
In most cases, I have no idea what it's like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What's sure is that everything's very rich.
So, maybe with the exception of marined surgeons in the room, buff!
In Japanese schools the bees are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a piece made very artificially for a boy and gives it in hopes of getting to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because I'm freaked out."
Finally, years ago I prefer to read Mangas.
To get a better understanding of comics and culture, one day I began to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a bottle of tradition and customs.
Here they have a great value.
On the other hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a strong, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
The rats also have feelings
It's said that a rat or a chicken feeling the danger of flying, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can they be controlled if they behave similarly to us, feel the same?
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" has been published for many years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is the truth without the ability to prove it?
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness states without me or someone else could prove it to this day, even though we can not even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can wait for it because all human brains present the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and general awareness, we enter the unknown area because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as the other animals: death is done, crying or attacking.
People behave similarly, as some scientists conclude on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to convey our subjective experience to animals.
First, almost always they include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobula of the brain cortex (because of their participation in the short memory and the executive functions leading to conduct).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than those of other primates and it seems absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our conscience that depend on the pre-frontal logo of brain cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in man's linguistic nature: As most of his experience is united with the language, that often means that conscience depends on him.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created anyway, would differ in many cases from the majority of our state of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analysed through our experiences, so its research presents major problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the conscious experience, but at the same time there is another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short-term memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it is more important to the neutral correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both can be similar or not.
Curiously, this approach highlights the importance of the pre-frontal logo of the brain cortex for the formation of the visualization.
And what's the result of that for feelings?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain takes place in the defense system (or its consequences, for example, the reactions of the body).
In view of this point of view, feelings are very fixed on the part of brain discipline, which distinguishes the primates and, above all, the man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, we continue to classify the final feelings because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar so that we can describe the states of others as well as ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, believes that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for the body feelings and the spinal cord, as does Jaak Pankseep, but is more focused on the spinal cord.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can be absolutely referenced to different types and feelings.
For theoretical reasons, I can't stand against that, but I don't think it is likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as afraid as possible is also felt in two cases: But how can you control if rats and men behave in a similar manner feel the same?
When you see the danger of a chicken eggs, why are you afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior still does not prove the similarity of experience.
That's true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar encephalopausal trunks, the cocachas on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is it the trunk of the trunk that is responsible for feelings?
Even when it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in the case of rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, possibly also sugarcane (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to try it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats and emotional sensations because their feelings are likely to differ fundamentally from ours (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected as much as it is measured by rats and men.
As I do not invest in the language and consciousness of rats, as well as feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see any more out of my noses, but I prefer to keep working without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
The President of the UEFA Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Ivan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister, said that preparations would be made soon under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of Ukraine's confidence in the ability to organize the European championship together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is much to do in both countries."
The time for the construction and reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is at hand.
The number of stations is likely to be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose any more time.
We now have to work very fast," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA will not remove our eyes."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced it by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewicki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA Platini's president that the preparation for the 2012 European championship will not suffer from this."
Only in the last period did many clubs in the first division have been convicted of manipulation due to decline to the lower category, and the division council had to be replaced.
Infuriated Dennis Quaid Contraatak
She wanted to promote a new film, she was talking in an interview about private life - and she has problems with her ex-wife: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star designed her ex-wife as an adult.
If you're angry and attack.
The recent war of the two roses in the ex-parage of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two actors of Hollywood publicly show an unpleasant battle between them.
Last week in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle Meg Ryan said for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was very unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She assumes the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the discovery of private things was Ryan's work with the press on his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "I hear that Meg often takes account of the history of our relationship in another version," said 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it's very "relative" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "reminisce about the pain and changes in the public, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is newly married and recently is a father of twins.
And so he ended with his statements saying, "Whatever my life is going on.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
Air ticket prices and hotel prices are going down
In the first half of 2008, plane tickets and overnight trips in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, aircraft tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and hotel perniques were re-valued - this is the result of a study by the travel service provider and the American Express financial services.
The company has analysed its reservation data in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter has been significantly changed in the second half.
After many years the prices on the hotel market continued to increase, pernovations in many sites were made cheap.
In comparison with last year, between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased by an average of 6.9 per cent.
From April to June, prices were down to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the debilitated dollar course, which was the reason that "the interests of U.S. tourists in travel decreased."
The decrease in hotel prices is also much more noted in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannóver, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the city of Norway, hotel prices increased by 26.3 percent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed the high trends:
Due to the increase in the prices of Cherosenosene, the economic class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-term flights even made more expensive up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of the plane tickets in the Economics class, compared to the previous quarter, fell by an average of 12.5 per cent, but the price changes for the Business and First Class were small.
In Germany, price change was more significant than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, and the second half dropped to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even decreased by half.
The reason for the change in prices is partly the increase in the flow economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty which liberalises the traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in air companies, as well as a large number of air companies that in the first half of 2008 declared in February - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV won against Gladebach 1:0
With a gol and simple methods, Hamburg's SV becomes the leader.
Luhukaka de Borussia is still not going to make the goal of December.
Christopher Klein well presented the forced landing of the national election player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed making a hole.
All I wanted to say is by reacting exactly to what happened, if I could clearly read it from your lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second gol," said Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
There was nothing special about catacombs, the rest time was over, and most of the present were again on their sites.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV's physiotherapist, enjoying a great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was made by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol, the assistant trainer, assisted with his head and raised his fingers in a seating signal.
Cornelius is a brother of Martin Jol, the principal trainer of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Go, the second gol!
But that wasn't done.
"Today everything wasn't nice to see," added Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard also wanted to have "more relaxed."
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for its impact on its head; and also the situation that the Gladbach team was very weak could not show all its strength to the weak team of Hamburg.
"That was a sushi victory," said Martin Jol summarily.
This month the Hamburg SV will meet its 121 years.
The Sabbath will be the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of the table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcel Jansen.
It is expected that the partial qualifications of the table correspond more to the validity of the link than to the domination of its HSV.
The chip with its mandatory players late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Petric refrigerator as well as Jansen who was removed from the FC Bayern need time to join, but the chip can still not shine with its success.
"We need more of the feeling and of the thrill," demands Joel.
After the vote
The Wall Street is spreading fear.
The first news about the failure of the bank rescue package left Down Jones to 700 points in a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points for one day in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
On 20:30, one of the world's most important pool barometers accounted for a 5 percent deficit in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
At this time the biggest lost in the Dow Jones was American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win.
The Goldmann Sachs bank's shares were almost 10 percent lost.
Just a few days ago a big investor Warren Buffet had been involved financially in the company.
The rescue plan provides for the provision of resources to buy so-called "podrids" mortgage actions.
But the sum will be paid by strike but step by step.
As a compensation for this, the State has to receive an option of action for financial partnerships that may be charged during the course of the course to reduce the financial burden of the state box.
Action courses in Europe and in the United States continue to decline
The aid of billions for banks in Europe and the United States does not reassure investors.
The course of the major German bank's actions Hypo Real Estate is low and has negative influence on the Dax.
Despite the saving of the state's financial market, the U.S. index Dow Jones continues to fall.
The losses of the speculative actions of the Real Estate and Commercial Bank have caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and private banks, Munich's real estate fund action for a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 per cent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and suffered a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5.839 units.
Financial markets worldwide suffered a fall.
The opening of Wall Street's day in New York began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the savings package of $700 billion from the US Government would not be sufficient to push financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to stay at 10,809.25 points.
The United States Chamber of Representatives wanted to vote on the draft rescue, and the vote in session could be the first of October.
The other European football groups also knew only one trend: at the beginning, the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index of Nikkei after benefits fell to 1,26 percent in 11,743,61 units.
Hong Kong's Hang-Seng index was 2.1 percent to stay at 18.286.90 points.
In India the main index of Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and ended at 12.595.75 units.
Following the announcement of capital expansion, Arcandor's actions were lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism corporation announced that the participation in the Thoms Cook company would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mystery phenomenon has led to the misunderstanding of researchers: the Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Relativity Theory cannot be so accurate.
The space probe "Ulysses" went on for almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel tubes are getting hot now, it's threatening to die in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a manoeuvre of the trajectory of space probes while they receive acceleration using the energy of the gravity field of a planet, such as Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as well as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what is surprising to researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave by 100 percent as expected under the gravitational law.
They're more frequent at speed irregularity.
The probes are improvised at higher or lower speeds.
The physicists could not explain this effect until now.
It was called anomaly during gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre.
Some experts fear that possibly even the general theory of Albert Einstein's Relativity that describes the attraction force of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so accurate.
Stephen Adler, the U.S. Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton's physics now strongly believes as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during the gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Oscura Matter, in which the astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The researchers in the universe have known the existence of the dark matter for only ten years.
It is supposed to have the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The dark matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of lives.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting at the time of release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall again at the attention of the kidnappers.
Wellt Online reported on the most important cases.
In view of the fact that European tourists who have been kidnapped in the Sahara are free.
The same information is available on State Egypt television, Al-Arab TV station and Italian media.
After news of liberation at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed the release: "Our spouses and other Queens are released.
"Now we control your health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a cousin as well as their eight Egyptian followers are well and are in security, inform the state Egyptian television.
The 19 participants in the expedition in the desert are on the way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the description of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudan army had recently killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue," the guard said.
It was just "receiving the reindeer" when suddenly it came to "this surprise."
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them were detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have asked Germany for a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money had to be given to the German wife of one of the Queens.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of its safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the women's reunions after they have received the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
Germany's embassies in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Father's abuse "takes the murder"
According to the court, years of abuse by his father led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight indistinct assault charges.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inaugatory study, knew that he had regularly attacked his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Tririse wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court knew that Ms. Randle was murdered in his house of Mutley in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
At the time the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to touch her and sell her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to Cornwall.
His daughter was transferred to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Mrs. Randle, who had spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was shocked by the abuse she had suffered twice a week.
In 2006, the tax collector Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, who, after being a big surfist and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "refused to life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, met the dead woman at her Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's father, who wrote a confession letter that concluded: "I often hit her and beat her eyes.
It's never been a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetisher, and for his victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when I was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim leaving his own life.
Even more obvious, it is that if she had not done so, the issue would probably not have been brought to an end in the courts."
And he added: "I have noted the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother, abuse has been on her daughter for years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An official loaded for data loss
The BBC was informed that a Gabonite officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on his way to work by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being sent to the police.
It is certainly the less serious charge under the law and does not provide any indication of the intention to commit a crime.
The BBC representative for the Frank Gardner Defence mentioned that the trial had come as a surprise to many in English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is loaded under section 8.1 of the Act, the key to the protection of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the staff member should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, due to the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Committee on Secret Services.
The forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than 80 thousand esters after the rescue/salvation of Bradford and Bingley bank.
The Government has, in fact, provided 14 billion esters to protect the deposits of 2.6 million bank robbers.
Interest in the loan will be paid by all companies using the money of the contractors, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Construction Companies (BSA), Adrian Cole, considers that companies and their members must pay "meaning"
The loan of 14 billion should be reimbursed as soon as Bradford and Bingley mortgages are reimbursed.
However, the interests of the internal market are to be charged annually to the 700 financial holdings.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that 59 construction companies were included in that number.
It is humiliating for institutions that acted with caution ... to be called to pay today the price of institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is said that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that mediation companies had to pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The treasurer estimates that the interest on loan will rise to 450 billion esters in 2009.
This includes that companies will have to recover 81 thousand esters to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Cole, Director-General of the Trade Association of Construction Companies, told the BBC that the situation was unfair.
"It is humiliating for institutions who acted with caution in the growth of the real estate market to be called upon to pay the price produced by those who were far less prudent."
According to BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of any company since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options are available to protect construction societies and their members against what could be a relevant price," said Mr Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this year from September to March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of mandatory interests, which can be almost twice as many.
As mutual organizations and without shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk up to five pounds per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey street will have to pay more for their milk.
Journalist Jersey Dairy has announced that the highest price of milk products will increase by an extra five thought the litre since next month.
It is the second increase in this year's price, after an increase in two thoughts in February and after the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had been increased before February, it was 2002.
Negated Freedom Under the Finance of the Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court has rejected the request for freedom under a loan for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His advocates said that the court did not grant him freedom under the penalty by accusing him of exorcising 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various charges of corruption against you.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was set free at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the League of Awami, has demanded that the country's government, supported by military support, grant her first full freedom.
Correspondents say that while it was granted conditional freedom to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of your release are or whether it will be able to remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for freedom under a loan for Sheikh Hasina, arguing that she could not obtain freedom under a loan because she was already in treatment in the foreign country under a conditional freedom," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We are going to make an appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Its defenders argued that she needed freedom of speech in order to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after 17 October, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, supported by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are charged.
Fears for the campaign against polymyelitis in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the United Nations – have not been able to benefit from a recent anti-poliomyelitis vaccination campaign due to the violence of the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations launched a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South could not be reached for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said that it had happened despite the promises made by the Taliban that had not been attacked or blocked by thousands of officials while the vaccinations were being carried out.
BSkyB lost legal challenge in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competence Commission after the decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the broadcast broadcast ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9 per cent in ITV below 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests hampered competition and allowed its negative influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, by buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopolio Office reported that the acquisition of ITV participation by BSkyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV and prompted the Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virginia's chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Offcom regulator were opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its VAT package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because BSkyB said, it would have delivered its voting rights.
New investigation in the case of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney-General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the disappearance of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Director-General of the Department of Justice criticised the action by the staff of the administration.
The report criticised the staff of the White House, the legislators and former Producator General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to researchers in an attempt to impede justice.
"Criminal complaints have not been fully investigated or resolved," said Prosecutor General Glenn Bellas in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their duties by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department had made the decision suggesting that lawyers had been fired by low-performance.
But later it was assumed that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than their fellow Members, and many observers concluded that waste would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the persecution of some Republicans, members of a high profile of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and may be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successor chief of the Department of Justice, Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure by the delegates, gave up his position.
A certain number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same.
The report of the Attorney-General is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and he stressed how he had a "primary responsibility" for the missing, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably uncooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former Bush collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Spike of Meat Loaf with a lot of honor
The rock Meat Loaf star will be honored in the Q Awards for its epic charm Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive the special award next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that obtaining this recognition will be "a honor".
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group is taking the applications for this year's awards and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that convey time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent voice capacity like that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the liver.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, the Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained for some nine years in the classifications and came to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for her heart rhythm in 2003, after a stroke during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later he found out that he had a stroke in his earphone.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of adventures, blubbers, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including Veterans taxis and local residents, find it difficult to tell them the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the North of the First Calle – before I find the Second Calle – between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This calcium, more than 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, is similar to a powdery challejon more than an active route.
There are no signs.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings in the First Calle
that wants to refurbish Extra Place and create a clean walk to shops and shops that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old date neighbours who commented on being in love with the truck just because it's one of the last remnants of the block past before the fitting of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Conservation and Urban Development, which has control of the road, has no interest in its possession.
At the meeting of the Committee on the Environment for the Use of the Land that took place this month, representatives of the Avalon Agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
The Committee, however, preferred that the road remain in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community, said n.3.
"The city is owned today by very few spaces and we would like to continue to own Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the road."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install seats, including some for use as coffee, in the hope of renting the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a porter of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, she didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned street and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a hole in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate estate fund was divided among his children, and this tight earthly franchise was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that ended in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street is probably best known for the photo of the establishment that goes out in the cover of the Ramones "Rocket in Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, cartons, shoes, chains."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the siege of East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest ones, should continue to be public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically without changes, a queen of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Complaints: A Bittorly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a story of the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little tight and no exit street street, also dark for the day and marked by doors of equipped iron and anti-window storage, with old weekly newspapers scattered along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was washed through the back of the street and stopped at the door used to enter the CBGB and is now hosting a luxury dress shop.
Graffiti in the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22 oz were about a new batch of broken newspapers.
Some passengers said that they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that a cleaning could be given.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the road in their current state.
"I've spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and dark places."
The debate on bilinguism: introduction into English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Spanish voters effectively is a difficult business.
The educational proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "Americans and Latin students have significantly less chances of graduating than white students," and this is a very clear consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "the bilingual education of transition" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers instruction in different languages in English, is effective in canceling the distance to final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of the Los Angeles county.
In this school, the vast majority of students are Spanish and family with low income:
more than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
However, an amazing 100 per cent of students in the fourth year have been evaluated positively in the 2008 math review.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent has dominated the English and art language test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama has enjoyed.
The Six Street School emphasizes the review and practice, the constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of apology.
In addition, and here is where Mr Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, the head of the Sixth Calle, the school's approach to English instruction to students is in the "total immersion".
Interference in English means the almost exclusive use of language in the treatment of the content of instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary success with students as this last one that has come from Mexico and that, if you go to school 12 months later, you wouldn't be able to collect what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr Obama take a school as Sixth Street Prep as a model for replication by other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the response, but the idea of the party's policies on education (the Associations for National Education have been long-term advocates of bilingual education) and their constant support for bilingual education conceals the predictation of Mr. Obama's response.
Although immigrants must learn English, Mr Obama has recently dealt with the issue by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "You must make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close the gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise them or trivial them.
The price of oil falls sharply after renewed economic fears
Petroleum prices are drastically reduced this month due to the concern that the US rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to re-enable the economy.
Heavy oil shares decreased from 7 per cent to $99.80 in the morning negotiations in New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has been down by more than $20 per barrel since last month.
In the last two weeks, the basic product markets have been devastated by the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before returning again, because of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Concern was raised by investors, once again, on Monday, despite the leaders of Congress who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the biggest in history.
The news was voiced by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The developments that took place in the final episode of the merger process confirm that Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation banking operations, as the government said this month.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that, at the end of the week, negotiations led to the rescue agreement "they seemed unable to re-active the market sense."
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for basic products, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and change will be increasingly focused," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products cannot escape this contamination.
From the product perspective, our most acute concern is the assessment whether the American virus will be spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and forecast reduction in oil and gas prices is 20 per cent for 2009.
Second living room: equipment sets record
After it was past, during the last eight periods, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things developed in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without annotation into a game of dissipation.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Cardinals Arizona had played with persequence under the clouds' shadows.
At this point, the quarterback Brett Favre met Laveranues Cole, making a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect price for one afternoon, in which the development of relationship between players had a great jump forward.
Favre found Cole for two more goals in the room, one of these when a cornerback fell and the other arrived in 10 seconds in the middle.
"I'm not going out of my way," said Favre of all the steps that go to Cole.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think of."
While Favre and Cole were engaged in the arrest, Cardinals' defence was ill-treated by the quarterback Kurt Warner.
The Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a shooting and turned it back 32 yards for a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith pointed to another passage and interrupted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was obliged to miss Warner.
In the last turn, the shortcomings required by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken the possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard boat to win a final 34-0.
These are the bigger points that the Jets never did in a room.
To the team trainer, Eric Mangini, ask you to describe the moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When he answered both of them - the Jets allowed 21 points without response in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second quarter much more than the terre.
They won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Refreshed Gebrselassia encapsulates your global record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated because many consider him the greatest runner in history, exceeding his own world record in Berlin's marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person to be able to run the 26.2 miles race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the street accommodation at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established the world record number 26 in a career of an impressive length so that it has established a global championship or a world record for any distance from the opposite course to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming, retrospective - that air pollution will aggravate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he intended to run to Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees when starting the race, 55 degrees to the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using in medium term some shorts 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Targat de Kenya have become long distances, the maraton record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told journalists that he had suffered headaches two weeks ago and that he had lost a week of training.
Obviously, the suspension left him fresh, not oxidated.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie said to journalists.
"It was all perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but at last it was all right."
The athlete has been subjected to some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the African-oriental rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much of his careers, in general, avoiding encountering many stars from the world marathon, based on the marks as if it were a career track, and putting them in front of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not reduce the size of Gebrssellassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the start of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the course at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi began challenging Gebrsselassie after their brands fell down.
But shortly before three miles of the target, Gebrselassie thought of a last impulse to separate from Kambai, who ended up at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived at the third place at 2:07:48.
In the female career, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record at 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not participate in Beijing Games because it was described as an injury in the back, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set up her best personal record in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation career, leaving a quarter of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make heads and then recover them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a city apart, the pride and proof of the life of color
Hidden by the expansion of the park on the theme of Great Orlando, just a few kilometres from the bright, noisey and hilly city, there is a quiet people, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated into the country and place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 colored men, 300 good narrators, many guayabas, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the year Zora! Faria in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And, however, in many ways, the city she described – also making it a tourist phase by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Project of Federal Writers of the Period of Depression – continues to be a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the '30s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often refused to share their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and who doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to launching a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain vigilant in the face of the desert.
"We are very careful about how our history is counted," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a resident of the city's oldest church and member of the church.
"You must be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a triunfo paradise and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of black affirmation and a community of almost 2,400 people living under a double level of poverty in the national media.
It is a literary center, but it is also a refined example of the rural culture of the south - sometimes detached, other praised - that was a nation of slavery in America.
It is not surprising if those who live here are once proud and reserved.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really started by Zora, as no one here calls it Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialectic books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Your Eyes We Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide turned the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten to the history of blacks and human drama.
Having the face of cement both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston brought his readers to the first Eatonville alkaline property store, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the left-hand road," he wrote, "there's the modern public school brown with its white ends, its well-kept gardens and game patriots, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can only read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the Dash widow and writes that Glenn Lee "sold drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston is referring to Eatonville with the autonomous government, as well as to analfabetism, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the picture.
"Now she described it as it was," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as an excendent of life who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did it without warning in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still ashamed to dress with dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many were sacrastically ruling.
"People were always very pleased to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, add, balancing himself in his chair in a backyard with a view to Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her too.
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only color woman in the Barnard College in the '20s, it was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major memorial ceremonies or large public lectures.
"I don't think your contribution to the world or your heritage has been understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography by Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-way road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main road of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Strong integration, among other things, had brought it relatively ideal isolation from the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix led to hatred of the community.
"During that period, a group of white boys went out of the city taking naranas and everything against the people who were sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"They also killed a girl once.
They fired him against a car's sand."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston wrote to The Orlando Sentinel newspaper, criticising the strong integration of the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "I objected instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the disintegration of schools, positive in some respects, has weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and weakened the confidence of their young people.
"The black children were accustomed to being evicted - I agree with this – they used to hug the teacher in the morning and in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This took, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't going to hug your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural break there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, have helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who have passed over the prejudices, as she did, with boutiques, confidence and lines like: "How can anyone deny myself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, author Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, a so-called biography by Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the libraries, re-introducing it into the American cannons.
The road project came right at the time the most famous daughter of Eatonville was again under the reflectors.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a party for Mrs Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the road to five ways, it would have been to put into what you would call a curved speed, a true civil pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd just said, "Now he saved Eatonville."
The victory on the road project has helped change the image of the city itself.
People out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started to come to the church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (with the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a refurbished and dressed Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville continues to be an anomaly in Florida: at just six miles from the center of Orlando, you may sometimes feel like on a road of the past under a summer rain in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(The 90 percent of people are black today.)
The forests that come to search for the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often treated with caution.
An early permission is needed to do most interviews, and some things - such as the walls in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced professor who has a weakness for the bright red, still fear that his island community can be misunderstood.
And, however, as the Festival Hurston has expanded, there has also been a higher level of birth pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also to the other ethnic and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, tone and mix.
It is a sincere civil sense that can be heard in the voice of 18-year-old Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who planned to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Department of Police, who said he might need some help.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old Winter Park Gemelas, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they are supposed to go up here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to anyone else'," says Alondra Kenon after going to the church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your story, it's a very nice city."
So here, in New York, everyone's talking about money.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan remained far away from the kitchens and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not be allowed to be seen in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the orphanage offices that are located above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who are monopolizing New York are facing daily with the worst "bad day of the office" since the fall of 1929.
Small ones for delivery at home continue to resonate their metal cards for tea through steels and bring muffin bands for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to pull between buildings of busy apartments, like human furniture, with 50 extremely high-pressure shirts to a yogo through their homs. The office workers still wait in the car for their food to take from the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon in the working days.
The employees wait, however, for their luggage to the salesmen's cars, and it is not possible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me that there would be no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimist forecasts there, I decided to open a new account of savings.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the end of the afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a team of about 20 people were already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw his effective or deposit, but in front of the customer's service bank, where customers of all life order their check timetables, tourists are looking for instructions to go to Macy's large stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my personal trust banker, and they were in charge for the same reason that I did.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks from places where they had moved, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Staten Island.
They had saved their money from so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), credit unions and savings boxes of their native city, whose branches only operate within the state of ownership, and who say to treat customers as their family.
During the past year, 15 of these banks have failed quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, entered the cave, and as the neurosurgeons headed to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a savings deposit of $440 billion, he was looking for a ransom buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops who were standing in front of me, fearing another crash, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe refuge, which is doing most of the damages in Wall Street.
Regular people in New York have become experts in finance in the past few weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking by telephone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her executive director of the affected aspect, Dick Full, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they were missing from a colleague's inactivity.
And Lynn, fifty-five and something will happen in the form of my block of apartments, has changed the normal line of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my purchases at the tendon.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, "I now have all my savings in the money market.
The exchange is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim drums proficient at the time Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left-hand side of the party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, associated with the party on the right-hand party Vladimir Belang, took part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Citizens against Islam" in Ammers on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They take traffic signals that represent the mix with a red line that passes.
The police are accused of extreme right extremists because they have promulgated a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that the political parties on the right made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 drums were severely damaged in Traun's cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in which the police thought it was an organized action.
Criminals have broken Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the drums, but researchers think this may have happened by attempting to hide the real motives of extremists motivated by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in some way related to the elections.
A spokesman from the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which reached Muslims when the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria was preparing for an introspection round after the turn to the right in the yesterday parliamentary elections.
The two extreme-right parties, which took almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Liberal Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigrants and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 per cent of the vote, made his campaign against the headaches and bukas, and also expressed his opposition to the food considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties tried to ban the construction of méchits and mines, arguing that they were symbols of the current Islamic policy in Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, indicate that the change is mainly carried out by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have prohibited Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star of sexual abuse of children, from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a ban on Glitter six months after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent's police made the ban on traveling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous sentences for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Justice of Ashford judges in Kent, but I was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court's Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at the Justice of Ashford judges in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad as in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, in order to be found under the register of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
and it is also necessary to communicate to the police the scheduled date with seven days before their departure.
Kent's police said he wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible side of Glitter in the county.
A police officer from Kent said: "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A police officer from Kent said: "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who stays in the United Kingdom because here we have systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protection to Kent's inhabitants is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely together to monitor the conduct of sexual offenders registered in the county and to minimize any risk that may exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally fled to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied his entry and he wanted to return to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court of Justice in western London after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to be registered as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for having images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Interior reported that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister calmed down and was pleased to know that Glitter had been forbidden to travel to France and Spain.

No tacos, no flyers, no stars.
The essence of the great masters of the flamenco, which is absent from the concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxing aspect of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy of the public at these moments, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expression of some hands, disappointed because they are not going out of the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternately in "Flamenco-people" the theatre of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with at least the least known of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the special iconography of the flamenco from different areas.
In addition to the programming of the Month of the Flamenca Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day," explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be people of any kind but, when looking at the photos, the observer is aware that they are not the typical images of artists in the stage.
These people portrayed as "in the street" are artists able to pass on scenes of passion, sadness, joy... in the public.
To capture the personality of these artists there is no need to take pictures from the scene.
They take their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to catch with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the taste of the "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long trip to attract the singers, guitarists or dancers with a silver camera.
These are photos that, due to the selection of camera and material, remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, confirming modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer understands the flamenco itself: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of the dance, song or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who is in charge of his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the claim that is made visible in a way of feeling, being and being sound and having been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
Known figures of flamenco like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the photographs shown in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's photos led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTProject".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I like to draw people, know them, and be able to enter an instant in their life, either a long or short moment.
I think in the photograph the picture is the most difficult gender.
You meet or face people, characters, sometimes you don't know, or they leave you only a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas real."
This collection of photos of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Gallery El Fotomata, located in number 20 of the Street of the Mata, parallels to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa trusts that the novel he writes is "a fear"
He lives in places where he doesn't know and speaks about unknown matters, but yet, Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to get out of the new project in which he works, a novel he has as a protagonist to Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in Congo for twenty years and passed through Amazon.
The always favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday by the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today "is a fear" and that "all indicates that the novel shouldn't be written."
"If he had been conscious, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his intervention at the conference of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that he's seen for four days passing through the city of the Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the highlights of the third edition of the word festival and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer in the audience - an old edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled out the joy of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found before him a very short audience at which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and great doses of humor, reviewed how he was born in him his literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "reading" and "live more than what he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined mansion" to fill his "inspiration gap" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and rehearsing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are supported.
The Spanish novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an effective experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said it "has effects" and "has made the most inconformity", so he asked the writers "not to give up" and "take responsibility" his vocation.
Climateology cements the Pozoblanco fair, which also remains without areas
The season of districts that closed the Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning, after checking the declared districters that the square was not located in the best conditions.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Meteorological pressures have been overcome by this party, since at last two of its three parties have not been able to celebrate.
The Sabbath was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second race of intended bulls.
The cartel consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz, and Juan Baptista, who were going to face a Castilblanco funeral.
So, only Friday was a party.
In him, the triunfador was Daniel Luce who cut three ears and went out to hombres, after leaving with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante saved his two tads with greetings and an ear, which gave the tendons more than his tour.
That's yes, worse still was El Juli, who passed through the body of Los Llanos without mercy or glory.
In his second tower, after a relief stage, the bronch of a large part of the public was won.
Jumping control in Álva on a train with two thousand pounds of sharks
Five less than ten from the wedding.
Control of the traffic of Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armion (Alava).
The agents give the top to the two employees of a van and they hire the Jews.
His load, more than two tons of sharks, wasn't how to stop him.
The agents pursued and detained one of the two employees, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., reported in a communication by the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and counterfeiting of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control on N-1, on their way through the municipal term of Armion.
A van was set up for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, rushed furiously, and the control was broken.
The agents began their persecution until the vehicle was stopped a couple of miles later on the arc, when its two employees were opened to flee to the street by a forest area.
The Ertziyaans finally reached one of them and were loaded with the 2,178 kilograms of sharks they transported and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisis loads, which led to their transfer to police units for an ex-exhaustive and heavy drug inspection.
In addition, the officials verified that the material had been "doubled" since it did not match the collection in the vehicle documentation, so a crime of falsification of the public document has also been committed.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate the detention of the other suspect, who was able to flee to the race as has been said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The arrester, A. A.J. of 28 years, was transferred to police units to perform the related duties and will be brought before court in the coming hours.
Stop the actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of any medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange manoeuvres by trying to get out of her apartment in Montecito, according to the People's magazine revealed a portfolio of California road patrols.
The witness has explained that at 16.30 hours, Locklear "was laying in the ground the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking car ahead and back, and on going back he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who seemed to have not recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear standing in a nearby highway and coming out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned the emergency services because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents brought her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed cooperativeness and the alcohol surplus has been eliminated since the first time, although "as the officials first observed, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine".
Locklear was arrested as suspicious of driving under the effects of a substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at 1900 hours even though he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a Arizona treatment clinic where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callers urge the long-term IU federation to assume their competencies in the Silva case
The IU coordinator-general of the United Left, Gaspar Llamzares, today assured that it will be the regional training federation which will have to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who allowed last week after being accused of conducting family treaties.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the organization that will have to assume its competencies," said Callazars about the action that the party must take with what it has to do with what it has to do with in the municipal context so far.
However, the IU leader defended the need for "transparency" to be present in the possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva could have done: "You have always defended that type of matter to the maximum degree of transparency".
In the same line, he stressed that training has "strong ethical codes for all public tasks".
'Mayo blood, Garci's Episcopal Apocalypse
Inspired by the national episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci celebrates the famous rise of Spanish against the French in Sangre in May, which is the most ambitious film in his film with about 15 million euros in budget.
In this way, the cinema has tried to "introduce the torrent of characters and social analysis" which has always admired the work of the newist knowledge, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Kim Gutiérez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interpreters.
Blood from May, with a metric greater than two and a half hours, is spent this Friday in the cinematographic rooms, to become a future ministry for Telemard for more than four hours.
Great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci has certainly fulfilled this round "a dream of childhood", which should be grateful to Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community has been obliged to round up a memorial tape for the second century of May 2, which has always accepted and when the story was based on the National Episcopals.
The 15 million budgets that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitute a "one opportunity" for Garci to share with the decorators and the appropriate clothingmaker the picture of "a late-one Spain which was wrong with the fight for independence, because the struggle against independence brought great delay to the people with the kingdom of Fernando VII," he said.
But the cinematographer laments that he has failed to count with funding such as the Alatriste or the Goya ghosts - more than the double of the May Blood, so he has not been able to round some plasma scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, who has worked with almost all his career.
Therefore, the Director of Return has been affected by what is his usual form of work, the stage with the actors, with those who often try to start the race and those who don't make casting, because he seems to be "slower" and consider that "part of the director's office is sitting in the theater and cinema to know what's going on in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters who meet in Sangle de May refer to their camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
candidate to Oscar on four occasions - of which one - Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May's own Blood, seven months of French billing and finally selected, the blind giraffes, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which must be known", has guaranteed.
With this film Garci doesn't expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for the future, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you agree to make a more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional trajectory.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the wild balarina Tortola Valencia
A wild whaler is going to honor a wild whale, too.
Carmen Tótola Valencia, a Catalan father (Florenç Tótola Ferrer) and anandaluza mother (Georina Valencia Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in the village of Triana and when she was three years old, she moved to London with her family.
He was a ballerina of free and professional dance in Eastern dances.
He had a lovely life, a pioneer for the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and charged with the abolition of the course that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe from between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gambo and she proposed this character and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the proverb, "we do not intend to count his life but to gather his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me the leaves of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the bride" suggested me a guru, or "the dance of the serpent" some tangos.
His dance was sexual and they told me that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: Miguel Poveda's who will sing Isabel again in one of his exhibitions, as he did in the "Open Door"; and with Matilde Coral teacher, who has specially wanted to collaborate with who was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola a grown-up, the character of maturity.
I'm glad you've agreed to act in my work and I'm very grateful for that."
The mountain also has the musical and guitar composition of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the persecution of El Pajaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "which makes the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were divine in all its expansion, and who are always loved by them."
The work also has in some way the life of this woman who has developed in such remote places as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all of Europe, since she has usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind you because I think it's from these women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less appreciates their work," Bayón says.
The show will begin today at 20.30 a.m. in the Vega Lope theatre.
The publication of "Diary of a recently married poet" also closes the Trinity
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Recycling Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez opposed marriage to Zenobia in March 1916, is marked within the activities planned by the Council of Culture of the Council of Andalusia to celebrate the "Treaty Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fifty-year grant of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the failure of both.
Thus, the "Treenio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" ends with the restoration of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This lamp of light", which was inaugurated last May, and that, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, New York will be scheduled to travel through the International Congress.
The Council of Culture of the Council of Andalucia has also acquired a total of eight copies of the "Diary of a Recycling Pot", edited by Pedro Taberero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalus poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Aussion of Evil," and gives the idea of the failure of American cinema, and of all America, in front of the impressive idea that Newman has gone.
Look, you've got to give them an Oscar.
And that has been withdrawn since 2007.
And I knew I was very sick.
That's how it's been a shame for everyone.
"Sometimes one sentence is beyond all expression, and now I have lost a big friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of making the ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and heritage had died at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, looking desperately for reasons for dignity.
When it's so hard time for men and little beings to admire you, it doesn't take to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
She was carrying for everyone an ideal almost platinum of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in respect of his firstborn son-in-law death for overdoses to his own household and organic food brand.
All a gift to a country where it has cost him a lot to oversuspend to a murdered food culture.
The expanding wave of admiration would be Hollywood without caring for nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he didn't die a man but once.
Another English, director-in-chief Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was even less than the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, was about to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"We have left the list very high to everyone," observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high the demand for probation and having a private life would be serious and distant from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's medical jungle.
But there's someone who's trying to do it, and Paul Newman is his example.
He was divorced once, but then I was married five years ago to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when he was sure he was given the opportunity not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburgers out of the house, if I have feet inside?" I used to blame him himself.
In heaven, you see the pride that your daughters in the earth match with their fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great papers he interpreted, of no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a lonely grandmother and a dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the fall of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race they called her, and to my judgment it was the worst race I've ever been.
A set of misappropriations that would have been very clear if they had taken it into account as an evaluation and I would have examined it.
But let's go somewhere and from the beginning.
Depreciation starts with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go ahead.
Which doesn't look bad to me, but if they're already making you do it all the time (including the chip to avoid dogs in the race).
So don't.
Here you were just going to collect the dorsal (first off, only for that) and (after the relevant cola), surprise!, there was only 'S' size for the shirt (second off, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or has the crisis decided to buy only small shirts with less fabric and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a little bit like those on the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the coke when you arrive is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the mouse.
More than 35 minutes waited, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as it was to be expected, the race began, and we still haven't left the mooch, although once it was achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the flood lessened the waiting for more than 40 minutes, which was accompanied by popular rebellion encounters and accommodating the castle.
I think some 500 people will certainly have lung cancer tomorrow, and some like me, they will not even appear with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark my exit correctly.
Since then, if I had been asked about the perfect career, this wouldn't have come into my mind.
So I think we're still going to sleep with a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft recipient search (virtual)
At the Microsoft MIT Emergency Technologies conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but can perform some basic tasks, such as requesting a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move through the company's fields) by listening to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a face-to-face recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are doing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the negotiating groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not a employee of the company.
Ask him if he's there to visit someone and tell him he'll be there soon.
All with no blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been much more than a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the necessary instead of commercial bassilla loads, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be too late.
All detected since Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extra" to Windows.
The change in course is appreciated.
Microsfoot is right, the operating system is losing its importance, as well as software.
When Google Chrome came out of the network, I was one of those who came up with the theory that Google was the first step to compete with Windows.
Many have pointed out with certainty that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for hardware and software to be understood.
Complete the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your wife something.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but there is a need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to execute Firefox or Chrome - or Explorer - and we spend more time each day browsing than in the window environment.
For what does half of the applications coming into the system serve?
It's less.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, actually, and I'm giving you a little example.
The photo of this post took her in one of the rest rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
In the refresher machine a cartel asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, of course, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather starting in 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly seek the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone on the street, is going to pass.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the South Coast, Leonardo di Caprio lighted one in Edward Zwick's 'blood diamond', the same as Al Pacino in 'El Padrino' of Francis Ford Coppola and was part of the uniform of the gay muscle parroquia.
And if we're quantified as star appearances, we can go back to the image of that punctuated bigote force that raised weights in an ambulatory circle.
In essence, it's no more than the typical male shirt of inner cotton, soy and without gloves.
The 'tank', which calls the speaking English, but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels, points out all the others.
First, by his revolving name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - he has to see the sport because he receives his name, according to the legend, of the poet Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' highlights the others by his excellent cotton, by his unisex cut, by his distinctive shield, and by the small Belgian flag (recognisable only) that the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail in the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college suites, back boxes, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Take thought about the comfort underwear.
Even though it's a shame to leave them like inside.
They're too much in love.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't care."
His enormous looks like his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is often but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new activity seriously in fashion.
For Monica, they're much more than beautiful and famous girls who give their name.
It has been in Paris on the promotion of Mango's signature in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes in a way that the Spanish house sponsors.
Quiet and scared, win in short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to introduce the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have thought about for Mango in this new summer summer season, in addition to attending the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's go, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango in this quarter working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the 50s and 60s, and there we get a lot of references.
Then, I love to lose myself through a city and watch women wear, mix and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Baillarina, actress and designer, you're a very polyfacetic woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it's all one and it's got a lot of legs in common.
I used to like clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to rush into my aunt's arms and see her dress.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, as a ballerina, I always tried to take care of my clothes.
You already know that Ballarians like us very much to make us our stylists for the classes and trials, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the dress is when you really meet the character.
Then everything goes together, that's true, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've done a little bit of the 30th, have you been in a crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
When the woman is done, she has experience and tastes life with less mistakes.
To me, the biological watch doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me much inner happiness.
So, do you think you're a mother or not?
From then on, I know I'm going to be a mother because I'm asking for my body and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; this I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I don't care.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with love.
As for the movie, you're hanging out of several stars you've been around the past year.
That's right, and I want you to see the light.
I, that I'm a woman who comes from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, everything I want for now, of course, can't be.
I want 'The Last Time' and 'I'm looking for the tomb of Christ'.
To see they look like...
A few days ago you started talking about a ride with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I'm going up to a passport to model it.
Simply, she called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to London to participate in a beneficial feature for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the dress we showed - I took out two pieces of our collection for Mango - went up to collect money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi's heart.
If so many things are said about her, I know her, I would tell you that many are not certain.
Besides, I'm staying with that very good part of what she's involved.
He asked me to stand up for such a noble cause, but if he came to ask me to make the pin, so would he.
To benefit the women of the third world, what is missing.
Alcoholic inducers must install 'alklock'
Inside he wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol, he must install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting the Hebrew vehicle, or if he does not fall asleep.
The initiative has already been announced last June and now appears in the annual memory of the State General Fiscalia, according to which it is a pilot project that will have one year's duration.
Its purpose is to re-enter the driver, so this will also receive a viral re-education course.
In addition to the experience of the General Security Taxation, they will participate in the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute for the Safety of Vehicles (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30 per cent and 75 per cent of car drivers reported more than once because of driving Hebrews are driving the car again.
Alkolock would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the amount of alcohol in the air and prevents the car from getting started if the driver does not lose its appetite; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than permitted.
It costs more than EUR 1,000 and would be punished.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduced to 65 per cent during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that 115 people could save their lives every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitating its implementation, as legal reform can be done on an ordinary basis, and, however, necessary reform on a criminal basis requires reform in an organic law.
The device is still not available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
In the morning, the Congress of Members will vote tomorrow for an initiative by the PSOE which is proposed to be installed on the school buses of this system, as has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and so 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17.40 the scheduled hour, the Spanish air force flying the Asturias Princes was landing in the Presidential Hangar of the Airport Benito Juárez de Mexico DF.
The sun was withdrawing, but its rays still forced them to use their hand as a glance to see the real couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
I had previously asked the taxi driver if I knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military valley formed by 27 marine soldiers who interpret the salvation of honor.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, dressed in the wind, very sober, doesn't use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had informed her that in the DF she was threatening to suffer.
They give a smile and a listening ear to the photographers before going to the room in which the official committee awaits.
At the hotel's door where they stay, one of the four great cities in the city is waiting for a detailed report on Mexican television.
The best gift of fashion
There may be no place in the most suitable world to present a fashion award, which Paris and perhaps no more expensive live designer and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international projection of new fashion talents.
It has a EUR 300,000 award.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs on Mango's escape route at number 54 of the Boulevard Haussmann of Paris and almost starved from the emotion.
Of course, it is the second largest store in Europe, and it is just starting with 1,335 square metres of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, combined with the wish to thank the designer Valentino, who presided over the jury of the ceremony, made us finish at a luxury dinner at the Garnier opera in Paris.
With the nearest Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart beat and making a few hearts, because of his brother's recent failure, was placed a chair from the house and some ELAH addresses, which cut the breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a dog almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his homenage dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, made the honours and is so proud that he ended up at Rotchil's baron, without a jacket, because both of them had been given to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who attended the store with pants and shirts - of his own design - and for the dinner he turned into a long black sexy dress, excited when at the night pass by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the ball test room and she, remembering other times, arrived at one of the bars and made a big cup of pie.
Ines Sastre did not stay on the pass by the palace's dependencies, but he first taught us on his son's mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canon that moves into the motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his savannas, his towels and had previously requested that there be no oils in his room.
Stars under the stared sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, anti-steroid number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the caotic and frenetic daily life.
And if it wasn't for a while, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relief to the libraries on September 30.
The alarmer almost beats when he wakes up every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it's even worse to imagine being surrounded by the angry rhythm that imposes the present life.
The office is called tension and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two ways to combat daily abuse and disconnection with the working world.
No, the number goes up to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
On the edge of the yoga positions, the classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book all a 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-street work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its peace will reach the libraries of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone thinks it is impossible to achieve peace in such areas as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' undermines such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline is no longer running for your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the sofa, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Chats
Some kids talk tonight.
I'm not referring to those who get really scared by telling us something that's happened the other day, but to children who talk about being asleep.
The first time you get the best you're going to bring you something, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign change of dream called dreams.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one told him what he was talking about last night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (one time in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodicly (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other changes in sleep such as the nightmares, the night terrors, the night’s enuresis (to be sleepy), or the soundbulism, but there is no reason to be so.
As we mentioned earlier, they may also be associated with very high fever tables, stressful situations or overexcitement.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It can be spoken in a tone of calm voice, quiet words, a smile or anything else (crys, slows, long talks...).
In cases where the event is very intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that is causing much anxiety and giving him a way out.
We have said that it is a benign change, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another change in sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with a sleep disorder or a stress picture).
What can be done is take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to encourage your child too much before you go to bed.
So find quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are afraid or a little violent.
With very nervous children and who have a lot of fun, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner peace.
This will make it possible for the child to have a more peaceful dream.
Once dreams appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day you will not remember anything about what happened.
Useful Councils
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you show very anxious during several episodes, you should examine or find out what causes such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what it says (which is not the most common), do not hesitate to make an inquiry to make it sound.
You won't get anything, because being asleep doesn't know how to organize your thoughts.
You will also hear what he says, but you don't know what he's dreaming to say that, with how much attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you make.
You never tell the child you could ask him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That creates anxiety.
In summary, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhauserin for the end!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the path of victory in his field after a long period of absence.
Without having made a good match, the team created many times of golf and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this encounter in which the rebels had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who shot the team with a far shot, Illhaeusern kasi was going to take the "power" and turn the Fenderflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the foot tip or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn't let the central champion pass and left only Rihai in the attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of Gol de Rihai and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousians with the Gol de Marais, well located to collect the balloon rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhouseens goller will not be able to spend much time enjoying his happiness and will be obliged to return to the warehouses a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and will not be a problem for the eleven Illhuusians who have retreated a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after an important train, the balloon passed very close to the transversal field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before returning to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a tour through Britain.
In the face of the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who strongly disturbed the entry of several Breton and normative ports last month, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hope to " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by Breton fishermen to achieve measures to increase gas prices, which marks a record of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesman of Elise David Martin, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses re-competitively and to save the employment and remuneration of mariners " .
The fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to minimize the movement in Morbihan and in Calvados, which have had such attacks nearly 10 km.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle Island have not been stopped.
"A filtering barrier " has been placed in the pool of Quiberon.
The mariners had already shown their determination to burn the moon, when the white, neumatic, and wooden pallets were burning in front of the fuel deposits in the port of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was extended to other ports from the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the cattle remained at the port, or Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, stopped the blockade of the important total de Donges refinance.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait until the meeting of this Wednesday, which will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " Crisis Committee " will have to consider tomorrow in the development of the movement and in its participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fishing committee's officers, who did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " fishermen have not left " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas taxes, are currently about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can only be reached with a gas with a price of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The invisible interpreter of " Two men and a destination " died from cancer at 83 years of age in his home at Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.

AIG would want to sell more than 15 % of its assets
Assurer American International Group, who has been released from arrears thanks to the American monetary authorities, plans to sell more than 15 per cent of its assets with a view to reimbursing its $85 billion loan, according to the issue of the Financial Times Sunday.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its retirement insurance in the United States, this journal needs.
The AIG Management Board met on Sunday afternoon to consider possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG is intended to be separated include its air-leasing branch, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the Transatlantic Holdings insurance as well as its real estate card and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been taken on these sales, pursue the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly carry out liquidity in order to reimburse its loan of 85 billion which granted it to the Federal Reserve to see the US authorities take 80 per cent of their capital, disposing of it with due proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historical session of the Bolsa de Paris
The New York Bolsa accused a historic fall last month after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss never seen in Bolsa of almost 800 points, and Nasdaq a 9.14%.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important decline in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, or the day on which the exchanges resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, a technological dominant, was retroduced 199.61 points to 1.983.73 units and the standard & Poor's index (extended) 500 to 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street fell after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Plan to save banks that would have been able to recover some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funds requested by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans of each three rejected their plan.
"That is not a good sign sent to the market, seeing Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of the Financial FTN.
"This shows how far the market has been counted with this plan," he added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days will come "too late".
"If the project is really killing (...) Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the US Central Bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would add to the credit conditions," Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight Economy and Finance.
And stressing further the sense of urgency, " every day the fall of a financial institution is announced in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following the Washington Mutual summit last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachova’s banking activities by its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis has dramatically accelerated, which has led to emergency intervention for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing "not just a crisis in the United States but a global crisis", the FTN analyst added.
The compulsory market has been brought up dramatically.
The 10-year-old stock bonus was 3632%, versus 3,827% Friday afternoon, and the 30-year-old bonus was 4,161%, against 4,357% in the evening.
Obama, winner during the first TV show
At the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, another came to know who had tripped between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
No wonder, the general quarters of the Republican and Democrat campaign declared their own victory in this sad television drama that has been followed by a third of the American families.
Politician analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though honorable, was not "birth" enough to allow him to lower his weight in the polls for five weeks of presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose survey of public opinion published last Saturday, grants five advantage points to Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), argues that it is the democractor who came out well.
Among the decision-makers, who are the ones they count, Obama left the winner with 39 per cent of the respondents, while 25 per cent of them grant the victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his own candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
It has good instincts," however Bill Clinton warns this weekend.
The Septuagint McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, emphasizing the "ingenuity" of his opponent on these issues that were in the heart of this first career.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." accused several times.
" I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president, " he also ensured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television publications.
Obama insisted that he represented the future.
Without discontinuing it, it was shown to be wise and necessary.
It raised its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done it," he replied, this weekend, a democratic television advertising that condemned the Republican for not having considered the impact of the US crisis. "
" During the nine minutes of the debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama complained yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a river.
He did not utter the words "medium class" or "employers". "The financial defeat clearly favor Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most capable person to save the economy that is at the edge of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive episode," he said, yesterday, the influential and democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an old member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's " good economic instincts " with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final outcome of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that in spite of everything it would achieve to reduce the taxes of 95 per cent of the United States despite the Wall Street summits, the Senator of Illinois also noted that the implementation of a possible country's energy independence thanks to the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear centers from here by 2030.
In fact, both candidates failed the issues relating to the financial saving plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted yesterday by the Congress and extremely imputable.
"In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents showed up on Sunday afternoon at the main stage of the Belarusian capital to ignore the results of the legislation in advance.
Hundreds of Belarus met on Sunday afternoon from the closure of electoral centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to manifest themselves against President Alexandre Loukachenko's power: "the dictator, he has to leave."
Some recognize that they have not voted: "Why, because they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been good to foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
It wasn't according to opposition.
" We have been on the side of the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the count of votes," Iouri Potemkine, the Union's spokesman for the Democratic Forces, complained, a heterogeneous regroup of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change, Ms. Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the European movement, because it is important to know who the votes are, and in our home, it is the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition enter the parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
"But your entry to Parliament may mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because " the dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Because if our economy, which has many debts against Russia, is in crisis, and if we are not reformed, we are in danger of becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote with anticipation (26 per cent of the voter in Minsk) promoted manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? Ask Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the electoral centers.
And there will be as many as five Members of the opposition to Parliament, who are better suited to power."
The night's silence returns again in October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The interview - Blood again to be safe
Hema-Québec celebrated his 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Francine Décary, had reason to be happy because Hema-Québec has returned to be one of the safest and effective providers of blood in the world.
And above all, he acknowledged the confidence of the public that it had been seriously vaccinated by the scandal of blood contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (VIH) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the disfavor of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer be replayed.
While Judge Krever was late to present his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee to plan for a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee carried out this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began his activities, nearly 38 per cent of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remember Décary.
The situation was disappointing.
After much effort has been made to improve the safety of blood products and much work over the years that followed, we have recovered the confidence of the public " , says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 per cent of the Czech population had the subsequent confidence in Héma-Quebec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that " confidence is extremely fragile " .
Since its establishment, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of many cases of the human variant of the disease of the cow, a new variant of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, Décary account.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which, when we do not know, and when a serious disease may arise from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease characterised by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we establish exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: the nuclear acid tests that enable donors to detect directly the presence of the virus and not the anti-virus anti-virus antibodies, in which the tests used so far were based.
Nuclear acid tests allowed the period between the time when the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We can reduce this period for a period less than a week.
We significantly reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowledge and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of contracting AIDS for a blood transfusion.
Today, every 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV - contaminated blood.
"That means that you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before it can overcome a case of HIV transmission by a blood product.
I believe that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without any concern," says Héma-Quebec's head.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen could get in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting that, for example, the West Nile virus was transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Hema-Québec must be constantly vigilant ", pursue Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to safe supplies, hema-Québec must also provide adequate supplies.
" The needs are increasing because the elderly population is growing.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatment is, patients often need injections of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donors network that regroups in the medium term only 3 per cent of Quebecs eligible for blood donation. "
All persons with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can, however, donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
In the medium term, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory covering the needs of hospitals.
The pensions are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they grow older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to hold them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since the present life is very frustrated, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving her blood," she suffers from Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million per year, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone inerts, heart valves, eyeglasses and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the Umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was previously considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of mother cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the position at our bank of our most nice sample of blood from the umbilical cord and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these each year.
We should start proposing it for inerts at the beginning of the next year ", Dr. Décary needs to describe this program of blood clotting as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't enjoy this," as Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softbol - The Impact on Semifinals
The Impact of Montreal was qualified for the semi-finals of the first USL elimination series, thanks to a victory by 3-1 (4-3 in final sum) at the side of the Seattle Subunders, yesterday, during the second and decisive part of the final room series, in the Saputo Stadium.
The central champion Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a gorilla on either side, central champion David Testo and Rocco Plantinino created many times of gol.
Roger Levesque was the only one who broke into Matt Jordan by the Sounders.
We remember that during the first part of the series of parties going back and forth, the impact had suffered a defeat by 2-1 in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburbation of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at Vancouver Whitecaps semifinal.
On Saturday morning in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the return party to bring it back by 4-3, but the Whitecaps did not have access to the semifinals by 5-4.
The impact should be faced with the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Briefly – Kovalev's victory goal
The third number one of the Canadians is ready to start the season.
The compound unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack on Canadians for 3-2 free shootings in front of Florida's Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the encounter, marked a gol, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev collected a passage in this gain, the Tricolor room in six preparatory parties.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal.
"I'm still not ready, before the Russians.
"I miss another party to feel comfortable."
He tried to play at the top of the first time, annotated Guido Carbonneau.
But I think I appreciated the end of the game.
I had a beautiful ovulation."
Charrest takes care of the North
The first Minister does not exclude the entry into force of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charrest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to make a choice during today's partial election.
Recharging the limits of our last great northern border ": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were designed.
In three large screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric exchanges, mineral exploitation, from Quebec seen by Google Maps, maps, etc.
Large means such as during the electoral period.
The first minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although he saw that his time was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a " vision" that the first Minister intends to have for Quebec, the " new economic space " , which includes an agreement on working hand with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the first Minister's talks recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at 49th parallel - had never been made of a presentation.
The first minister was limited, however, to explain why Norte was " a joy to the vast potential " but did not give a term, investment amounts, or a precise priority in future projects.
What could be most developed is, in particular, hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mine sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, five, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and diamond " , according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "field of great times like France," is our house, is in Quebec.
It's not just our house, but it's in us," he insisted, as to show that he asked for a national founder myth.
Quebec was built very thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the stream towards gold in Abitib, the Czech engineering, the Bahía James.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having taken a theatre break to observe the huge map behind it.
Norte, 70 per cent of the Quebec territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the first minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed long ago and when the occasion is presented, I repeat that position by the government, " he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we have to repent of our North vision," he said speaking of the passage of the north-east, which will open every year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The first minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly former member of the Chebeque Party of Hungary), have already begun consultations near a community of thirty.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play.
The first Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given " .
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, organized and respected by the environment " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this "view" as one that is continuing with the first liberal ministers who preceded him.
" As the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the current themes at the end of the week, which began Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed the rebuffing of the Beauharnois Centre at the Adelard-Godbout Embassy.
"From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the peaceful revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bouursa, which made the Bahía James our party about the future," Juan Charest said.
At the press conference, another reference was introduced, the conservator, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, first minister from 1957 to 1963.
Turning to the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric exchange project, Mr. Charrest stressed that his service position was scheduled for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I hope to be there," he entrusted his troops, raising applause.
Indeed, the first minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and no doubt not in 2009, did not withdraw the possibility of making a vote this autumn, which the law permits.
It underlines that its time is still full, especially due to a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council on weekends provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, in particular " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec, in particular, calls for the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
I would also like Quebec to name members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and to have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the great lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebeque party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the development policy of North Quebec, which the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to it, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today" said Mrs. Marois on the side of his candidate in Jean-Talon (vote made today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a Government's North Plan.
"But what you want is that this isn't just a show," commented leader Sebastian Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letter - A Dedicated Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) at Harper's office, which was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "greed" for Canada.
To deduce this woman who has brought an inconsistencies to justice and deserves all our admiration what she says all about the relationship between the prime minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not returned to their country that is closed in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that have been convicted of him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, renewed its promise and left a child in human situations to live as a soldier.
The only one who counts with a false justice to evaluate the guilt of the accused.
We remember that UNICEF, the International Amnesty and the Canadian Law Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefits of an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes the eyes on torture: it is not important for a young adult to be psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of action.
We still don't realize that, but we are presenting an insiduous erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that it doesn't make sense.
The time has already come in which there is no morality any more: we can treat, torture, arbitraryly imprisonment a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far as a minority (what will happen after October 14th ?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that admires the Truth, the Law and the Order: I do not see that this government has abandoned what it has done to our country's reputation and dignity.
Mr. Toews is shame caused by this rejection and by nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold Orwellian speech
In his edition of September 17, Le Devor published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president and director of the Canadian miner Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest airline in the world attempted a process by disfamination of six million euros against three authors and a small editorial house to generate a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution by dissipation, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the complaint is of little importance, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada should spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and to fight, with very different weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by nearly unfunded bullets.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often involved in breaking down the demands with a view to imposing a friendly arrangement that will discourage the opposition in addition to questioning anyone who might dare to reconsider the matter again.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
In contrast to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, the discussions in Canada are usually due to the exchange of ideas and not to the beatings.
It was enough for the mine to open its books, the expeditions and establish a genuine debate, through journals, media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to rely on public opinion and rejects requests and letters of support for the authors of North Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could ask for a "public" debate, ignoring this opinion?
According to the Vice-President, this term appears to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this represents a very limited view of the concept.
Democrats also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and editors of North Canada does it primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but having as a basis civilized change of arguments, and not in the context of what many people see as a persecution-mortem (in pursuit of the " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a request for the authors of Northern Canada, threatening them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
He denied the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which represented the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that corrupt the rich business of this world in a country like Canada, under many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Northern Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university world, to which we belong, has known for a long time to manage debates and disputes and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unmovable persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he has no desire to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, but also to the public debate in Canada, and it is already time for governments to put devices that limit this kind of abuse.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic saving plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the U.S. $700 billion plan that seeks to reverse the financial crisis that took place in Wall Street for months must still be confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it provides for better control by the elected members of their implementation positions, new mechanisms that seek to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of households deprived of payment, as well as a right of taxation on salaries paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The American Secretary of the Treasurer, Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republic at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day round of negotiations.
" We have made great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the economy and the ordinary United States before the current Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
" This is the main point: unless we do this, traumatism, chaos and disturbances over the daily life of the United States will be immense," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in recent hours because they feared the effect of a new failure in the dream of investors.
The last time they had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates at the American presidential elections, which had recently acceded to the negotiations, proved to be more favourable to the agreement, without forgetting to express their satisfaction that they were obliged to reach this end.
The democratic Senator Barack Obama was entrusted with certain provisions to reach the agreement, in particular the one that would allow owners to maintain their home and the salary of the leaders of the State-sustaining companies.
" When the contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibleness of some, there is no need to congratulate them.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked in another string to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote."
" The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to say and with which we can proceed.
He said that the option of not doing anything is unacceptable."
The plan of 700 billion is intended to purchase with the money of taxpayers the suspicious debt, risk-related and inexplicable assets of the US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the establishment of a real estate bubble that first led to the decline of mortgage credit before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCA) and to cause liquidity freezes and loss of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican voters who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have come out of stagnation since the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are guaranteed only by the government, rather than purchased.
With a view to eradicating the aspirations of all the world at Congress, we also added a provision which provided that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this programme, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion which may be added to 100 other billion if the President appears to be in need.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote of the Congress.
Instead of its aid, Washington will receive participation in the companies that will divide it in the event of profits and that will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the detention procedures relating to housing acquired with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and metal compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it voted in favour of the House of Representatives since today and the next Wednesday.
Despite all her efforts, she is still not sure that her plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, member of the camera finance committee, declared to his voters that "with every indication, Washington does not want to understand " .
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But it is not what is involved in profiting from contributors. "
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an encouragement to a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Forty hundred economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: we ask the Congress not to rush and carefully examine the road to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we again had evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group by EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had declined to buy its competitor in cash since it had lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) during the crisis of the U.S. real estate loans.
Strongs employ 85,000 people and form part of the twenty largest European banks and of the ten largest insurance companies.
" This is not money lost, said the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wooter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we will recover a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that rescuers and families now appreciate that the times are busy."
During this time, on the other hand, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that is suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be responsible for all the loans outstanding in the Bradford and Bringley bank and over EUR 41 billion ($75.5 billion) for real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander told him yesterday that it was the one that would buy the British bank bank finances and bank accounts.
The Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a lovely smile had been released from his narcissist side?
Yes and no.
His dust, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident would also have removed him from the register of power that has the true sacred monsters.
But what a great depth corridor!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83 years of age, because of a lung cancer in his joint of Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American movie of the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brandon, who seemed much and who was long considered a rival in the movie, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the establishment of dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood often makes great children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
Without mesmerized, last brand of quality.
Because it was designed by an all-embracing country of self-made hand, of the warrior of the war of the Pacific, wounded in battle, who at the beginning of the 50s studied the dramatic art in Yale, then attended the actor's Studio in New York, before triunfing in the theater, television and soon in movies.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car pilot who was ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a six symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They also disappear with him the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well.
He's a respected man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the vertigo to the cinemas this weekend, while his big papers are being intertwined in the black screen of the memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in eternal change came through it.
Many memories come back to memory like the Cowboy with the love of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the suitable Zinc tea of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we appeal to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that does not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone through the history of the movie.
This criminal, criminal, tortured, violent, inflexible insomebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This is a nice manganese in The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar in the best movie in 1973.
Player of bitter billing and winner in the magnificent film The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat the character in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which was valued in 1987 by his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes with years, it was him.
He's still alive.
The ages change during their career.
Young people especially know this because of George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, a little orthodox hockey team trainer.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With the last role of the Irish mafia's father in the Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was rice.
Unlike several movie legend who left the race quite soon, Newman stayed very much in the movie world, accusing Hollywood, his gold, his scissors and his concessions.
French cinematist Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " the subplaying " and that judges its benefits too supportive.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman when the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, less often was the role of young gallant than marginally: neurotics, alcoholics, snakes or desperate, whose roots reflected rebellions.
As a performer, Newman revealed sides of his true pudic sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, described a female picture of melancholy.
The one who lost his son Scott because of overdoses dedicated his film Harry and Son to 1984, work dust and sadness.
"Among the many men who were born yesterday to Newman, his great friend and former fellow gunman Robert Redford (who had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very anxious: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Generosity, love of existence are important roots of the lost actor.
On the other hand, on the other hand, there is also a large military force for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a questionnaire against Hollywood's excess.
We will have seen a lot of his face ruling over the bottles of vinagreta salt, salsa, galllets and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to their Children's Fund in difficulty.
Newman, instead of enjoying his myth, will be committed to the end.
He gave his five daughters a letter containing these words: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And it's a privilege for us to have followed the course of an American artist so bright and so generous.
In summary, a citizen model.
What did they produce in the Zuchlag &amp; Co. billing factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings will be initiated against Janos Zuschlag and his colleagues.
It is accused of politics and its complications of committing significant, commercially, continuously and in an organized manner other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to Fiscalía, the funds obtained in public competition were used for their own purposes by justifying, on many occasions, the performance of works with false invoices.
Public funds and grants - in total, some 65 million HUF - were put in the trust of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also known by researchers, was to justify the coverage of funds obtained in public competitions with false facts beyond which there was no real execution, and the different associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the charge, most of the invoices were false.
To that end, the workshops were obtained on the market in the Józsefvárs District and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that in the name of which company should be carried out the false invoice was decided among others on that route by the Upper Balaton Region around Janos Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
This last confessed that for this purpose, guests and restaurants had to choose.
He requested invoices for his consumption and they served as a model for the compilation of the invoices presented among others in the tenders of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, and in the Capital Association.
These invoices were signed in most of them by István Lados and his complicity András Žhri, who, according to our best information, wrote the reports needed to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a beerry.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its competitors, this gastronomic centre provided food for a group of nine persons from the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the central manager - so many people don’t go to that place at all.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Foundation Jövőret - later called Egygyütt to Harmadik Éveredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
Because a hostel in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there one night, but the invoice contained hundreds and thirty people.
But great fantasy factor manufacturers also expanded when they pointed to the Pigal Kft gastronomic center. Because in the bookstore itself - according to the information given to Fiscalía - there were no documents on the name of Jobb Jövőert and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the tax and showed him the invoices, he already knew that he was dealing with false documents.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he did not agree that according to the bill, hundreds of people were accommodated, since they had only eleven rooms in which they did not have so many people.
In addition, food was also included in the invoice, while the restaurant spent some time not working.
The invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency selected in Budapest only organises trips abroad, so that in the actual payment invoice they indicated in full as a service a trip within Hungary, which was not in line with the agency's invoice delivery practice.
In addition, as stated during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although travel outside the territory of the European Union were tax exempt.
Among other things, the measure of VAT was also incorrect in the four documents sent by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the foundation Jobb Jövőert, since the services of this company are not loaded with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, and the hotel employees only extended invoices made to the machine but the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "suppliers" also made other errors, as in the case of a company in which they placed on the invoice as an activity carried out by road transport to which - it was assumed during tax investigations - did not perform the company based as investment consultant.
Similarly by formal differences - an inadequate format of the bill, false seal is assumed to be false the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Üveredtre Alapitvány, for XXI. Szazadi Culturalis Egyesüet and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt or the Confehertó Sports Camp, their representatives refused to issue those invoices.
The falsifiers also paid no attention to the fact that when the Fiatal group Városert Egyesület was eating there (2001), the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyhaza was in the liquidation process, so the liquidation process - according to our information - had refused to send such a document.
The invoices were issued knowingly
Another group of manufacturers of false invoices are those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Fundación Esély Budapest Álapítvány , at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj socialisták, issued a bill worth about four million HUF in the name of the Fundación Együtt to Harmadik Ávered.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - According to the charge, one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, agreed to send fictional facts.
Similarly, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his colleagues the Biogate Kft., currently under the liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices for an estimated five million HUF to the Foundation Jobb Jözéret Alapítvány , the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesüet Association , without real economic activity behind.
There was no capital movement either, as the invoices were subsequently cancelled but they forgot to make their documents available to this entity.
The next group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have any connection with the accused.
So, for example, Ivan Kubatov was the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with fictional headquarters in Budapest, which was involved in fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices for an estimated 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of media.
According to the research data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a brother to who Ivan Kubatov should have also removed the documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that issued to the company invoices for Atlasz, Hoppá and Egygyütt in Harmadik Üveredtre Alapitvány covering the import itself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by the brothers' Albanians at the request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually operated because, according to the accused, they did not receive work.
But he benefited from these companies, as, on request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, sent invoices to the companies for the organizations associated with Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov, on behalf of the Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade totaled 15 invoices to different entities for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The Fiscalía considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of invoices.
This man even used the company in command of Szi-Beri to deliver fictional invoices used in Biztos Pont’s competition.
The Y-Generation and Society for Modern Hungary presented a competition in January 2006 to Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the purposes of the competition.
In order not to discover this, they presented to the TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the figures found during the discount record that Arpád Kemexei held at the head of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably report in court - as they did in Fiscalía - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting can be the confession of the main accused, János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismiss everything.
Because their confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: what is it interested to do?, because perhaps instead of the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - socialists came to an agreement with him to assume all responsibilities for Zusi.
Who, on the other hand, for these days until he could be offended, since in order to ease his prison conditions he requested home arrest, but he was rejected repeatedly.
While many authors of highly valued economic crimes, who never returned the money, were free or at least able to wait in their own home for the sentence, he did not have a chance to do so.
Psychology: Why do we spend more money?
The participants in the substations are willing to spend more money and overestimate the product.
The neurologists and economists of New York University discovered the neurological bases - economics of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose their skills such as eBay subsistates, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental substances.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in a substation and while both were examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the substations, where it is essential to place more than the other, when losing the game, the operation of the complex called strata located under the brain cortex was intensified.
This brain area, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "auto premium" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in apostasy is described as a prevention to prevent an intense reaction to the extract.
In order to establish its theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups attacked a person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product in question, and its components were warned.
In addition, he was promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 just before the summit, but in the event of the loss of the sub-group members, even that money was lost.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one, the triumph was raised and for the other failure.
However, testing the hypotheses of neurologists, members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to include more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
They thus far explained the phenomenon of substations only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation" - Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world some 50 million people suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at 100 thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the patients do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms appear very much; they are characteristic of the infection of the liver and ecteric, but their pathogens and the diseases that occur are very different.
Hepatitis, depending on the pathogen agent, is spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humor (esperma, vaginal humor, saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be protected by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consumption of infected food, are demonstrated by a general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that appears in the skin and in the white of the eyes the iecteric, the excretion is clear, the dark-colored urine and the healing can last even two - three weeks.
Each year, one million people die in the world in cancer and hepatic cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only 1 in 10 infected people receive pharmacologic treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: liver cirrhosis and even cancer may occur without treatment.
Most of the infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent destroys the liver cells in the form of palatine and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early recognition, systematic medical control is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently there are about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be detected with routine laboratory control, it is worth consulting the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eliminate the organism's virus, thus eliminating the infection and preventing cancer.
On 30 September it was the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to call attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Do you think less of those who believe in God?
As a result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that has also eased the deaths of the martyrs of Catholicism.
The scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious faith influences human suffering - reported the British Telegraph newspaper.
Within the framework of this single experiment, electric shocks applied to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
As a result, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scan technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the research series in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the various departments of the University also participate.
The analysis took place in the following way: they set up an instrument pointing to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of the 17th century Sasopherat and the Lady of the army of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the show of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful, as long as they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a comforting effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scan, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing religious or otherwise.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected", "they were comforted and in their hearts the peace prevailed."
On observing the religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than they had seen Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, believes that with any such impressive image, a similar effect can also be achieved with the atoms, only the proper image must be found.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
English bishop Tom Wright celebrated the results of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should also in many cases change our personality" - Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what would be the effect on the rule of pain if the Madonna of Leonardo or other painters of his style were shown to faithful people?
Would the vision of a high quality Virgin Mary have even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On its tenth birthday Google can say: you can be found both in the people's pocket, and in the sky above your head; you know where your holidays were, what doctors visit and what they care about.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not enough.
On the other hand, the sceptics who make a comparison with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated in the Financial Times newspaper that Google's main goal is to collect as many personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary in order to be able to meet the original goals of Google Founders: "We gather all the information in a system!".
According to Google's leader, the company even after ten years of work that has been back in the world is still at the initial stage of the effort to process all information.
To the question what is going to happen within five years Schmidt replied as follows: whether Google could answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would best convince me?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions as simple as there are not enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their web browsing, the keywords sought, IP addresses and pages around have been stored precisely when the search ended.
Thanks, for example, to Personalized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can review what they were looking for before, what they opened up and thanks to this story will generate much more personalized search - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based on, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if my data is used against me, if they collect information about my activities? - those who are concerned about Google's information monopolies.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not removing, fear of punishment, anxiety for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only preserve, but also in case of justification, all the expressions sought are sent to third parties, in such cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of the Internet.
The most recent example was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google provided it to the Brazilian government with the information on its website, Orkut, to identify the pedophiles.
On the other hand, the Internet concerned about human rights was relieved in May when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the protection of electronic rights, demonstrated successfully to the court that was justified in its dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google will not be forced by any of the constitutional points to provide any type of information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government was able to achieve its goal of strengthening the child protection law adopted years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand search sentences, but without obtaining individual user search lists, neither the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
That is how the opinion on Google is quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data are critical because they think that their privacy, their privacy, when they start using Google's services, and they rebel against it as against the multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internalists and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vanguarding corporation", not their rival, Microsoft, categorized by your Windows as the winner of the World, so much that both struggle for the same objective.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for its applications, the code is open and the free software package, constantly updated and seems more young, more cooperative than the official software giant's practice.
But it can also be because geeks have precisely seen the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that has just been produced by one of the key words mentioned in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 deals with collaboration, leaving intended holes behind us and using the communication channels available, and while the measures of these different individualities, the essence remains the same: show us ourselves.
A normal youth can have a profile on many collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even connect them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that provides a list of their music habits, then they can include them in a tracking system such as FriendFed or Blip.fm, which can also have a blog, where the latest photo gallerys are automatically stored on Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases of what happens that, for example, the news, when you see the stream of photos of the next morning of common friends, you know who spent the night with your girlfriend, or you can tell the employee of a company because this writes your honest opinion on the company's direction: one thing is sure, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's "on-line" life is what she shows herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the behavior of our youth today.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to hide Google's monopolies, can do it (starting, for example, with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but don't leave holes).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to avoid finding them, but they can replace Google's "on line" applications, from text editing software to image applications and reading news with alternative versions that do not connect with giant servers or prepare the best possible profile on us.
The public opinion awaits almost the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), advertising areas of AdWords/Adwithout threatening the revenue of advertising agencies, while services that are introduced more rapidly cause serious head pain not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
Critic observers, however, will also find alarming contradictions: for example, the superior director rejected the protest of employees after doubleing the price of the company's childcare, considered too much towards the limited number of employees' food, but this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google submitted to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company, according to the agreement, filtered all information that violates the moral and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service with advance, but only when they are already ready to operate, what if it is sure is that the predictable problems of the next months and years can be reversed in the world: while some believe that the project of scan and file of Google books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be mentioned by the U.S. Supreme Court, other issues of its system of health, because in it we can create our own full health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it can provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, a novel by the populace of Cory Doctorow, describes that future, in which a man can only describe Google's data with alarming accuracy.
Two minors helped remove the holes to the author of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
The police asked two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to a reasoned suspicion, helped to remove the crime’s eggs - the Commissioner-General of Public Order of the province of Borsod said on Tuesday.
Young people recognized the crime that had been imposed on them, and are currently accused of crimes.
The two children - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency, are two girls - can be defended in freedom.
They can receive up to 5 years of prison for the complexity.
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in detention for Sunday .
He was accused of murdering several people with premeditation and codication.
Research revealed that 23-year-olds had a large sum of 53-year-olds.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so the Wednesday last week quoted his creditor at the head of a company of Ózd, where he killed him and then killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to ICTI information, the young man was prepared long ago to commit the crime, as he committed murder with a previously hidden weapon in the crime scene.
The police are studying with a gun expert and the circumstances of his use.
Warsaw Bolsa presented an offer to buy Prague Bolsa
The Warsaw Valerie Bolsa offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - by hundreds of percent of the actions of the Prague Valores Bolsa.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Vallares Bolsa, confirmed the offer made by the Polishs, although the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Bols from the possible new owners of the Prague Bolsa.
The reason is that the Warsaw Bolsa is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State which, within a few months, wants to sell 60 per cent of them.
The Czech Economic Journal E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Bolsa de Prague.
According to the Czech press, they have so far offered the Bolsa de Vienna, the Transatlantic Bols Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange in New York, the Bolsa in London and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Valores Bolsa, declared last week that the worst new owner among the interested would be the Warsaw Valores Bolsa and did not discard the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Valores Bolsa would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of Prague's Bolsa in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, about 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The wholesale owner of the Prague Valores Bolsa is the investment bank Patria Finance with a participation of about 25 percent, followed by the Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the European press point of view
The main European journals in their March comments to the most profound international financial crisis speak of a "second of 11 September".
The global financial disaster is due to the President-in-Office of the Republic of Rome - the President has not been able to even get his own party's support for the bill made in advance, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Habor, which spoke of the multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a "second of September 11th".
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the spy figure.
In the view of the World, the error of the political direction of the United States was what led to the world economy at the edge of abesomism.
It grows increasingly the risk of the demorrowing of the North American monetary system and then this will affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress's vote, the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is carried out.
There can be no objection to this threat - points to the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still draw salvation belts to the tambaling financial institutions, thus saving them from the money of the taxpayers.
But if the domains still disappear, then they will no longer be sufficient neither the new funds nor the new improvisations.
It is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to leave their nationalist selfishness behind and to centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in the crisis received only more than EUR 100 billion Monday - recalls the Der Standard Vienna, adding that more and more concerns are that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers should also pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not so far been seriously affected by the crisis that is happening as a summit by the Continental Strip .
"saving" will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good to define: in what cases is it justified to use the taxpayers' funds to avoid a worse?
The smart car imitates the flight of the best
What would be the best way to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not imitating the sensors of existing obstacles in nature?
For example, he is one of the best.
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the beneficiaries gave the start point for the Nissan engineers to design the next generation of the collision prevention system.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan designed the BR23C model-type robotic driving system, which gave him the characteristics of the beneficiaries, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can be completely wrong.
During each improvement flight, it creates its own dedicated space that actually seems very much to our security guard capsule – explained in the Kazuhiro Doi exhibition, RP and development and research technology director.
They play an important role in the eyes of the well-being workers who are able to see in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, engineers used the laser beam measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles ahead of the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, in an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle's microprocessor that immediately turns into a manoeuvre to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds, the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle's robot imitating the movements of the improvementrs, changing the direction by turning to the necessary extent the wheels.
Unlike any existing system, this manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If it wasn't, the vehicle's robot could not react with enough speed to escape obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the security capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what an improvement is in order to avoid other improvements.
This process must be performed in an open and close eyes.
However, unlike the beneficiaries, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, but can only be bidimensional and only in the direction of the wheel rotation.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available for the well-being of others, they used here only as a possibility for the car robot the rotary movement and acceleration as well as the brake.
The BR23C uses litio polymer batteries that are lighter and is greater than its energy density, which means they have a longer life span than the lithium ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process data, nor much less the storage capacity.
This device in each second must process only some input signals and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store these data or react with an instinct based on the data of previous manuals, thus using only a few decades of kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards developing technology to remove the obstacles immediately, which according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series within ten years.
Another possibility for your application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to lead to your destination, hiding existing obstacles in your path.
You've got a name for this cute kid.
The written version of the financial savings package of $700 billion has been prepared, which will be implemented in several stages in order to buy the bank's miscellaneous credits.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to the time of the East Coast during the new consultations that lasted until midnight, the convention leaders reached an agreement on the financial savings package of $700 billion in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the North American Congress, said that it is only necessary to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister for Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment, said that this programme will work and will be effective but need more measures. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street but about giving it back to the economy car.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before the 8th of the night, according to Washington time (or before the two Mondays, according to Central Europe), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the draft emergency law for the financial stabilization of 2008, the first Monday will vote for the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted with Pelosi on the evening of the week, and then the White House also held news on the deal.
We are happy with the progress made during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The programme is different from the original Bush administration's proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy low-quality credit securities.
Only half of $700 billion can now be spent, using $250 billion immediately after the Congress has voted, probably Monday, of which the Ministry of Finance will buy securities of credit, ill-qualification and other $100 billion, depending on the president's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of $700 billion may be spent after a new decision of the Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credit, mortgages and credit-funded securities, as well as other "venous"-type credits.
The purchase may be made either directly or indirectly - informed by the competent authorities of the ministry.
The law enables affected companies to participate in a security programme where the financial card guarantees the concern elements, whereby companies will pay the corresponding amount of damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law thus ensures the necessary financial resources, which may even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the North American financial system, the sale of bad financial resources, its insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the depletion of some large financial institutions.
We do all we can to be ready to introduce the law when it came into force.
On the contrary, the bank's chiefs who are in trouble and expect State aid can account for the official limitation of their remuneration, which the North American Argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, as well as limitations depend on the form of assistance from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys under a substation, an additional fine will be imposed for gold paracaitors, unless the failed chief of the bank is prosecuted.
When buying bad credit directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the remuneration of the chiefs is not excessive.
In addition to the above, there will be no change in existing gold parachute contracts, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in the history of North America that will be a legal limitation on the income of the Directors General - the democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress committee, responsible for financial services, commented on this measure.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the participating banks in the programme, thus reducing the risk of contributors, as they can ultimately benefit from the transaction in the recovery of the economy and with it the bank.
According to the draft law in the next five years, the President shall submit to the Congress a proposal on how to restore the financial sector's losses to contributors.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations with regard to the project.
This is not what American citizens told us, that is not protecting the contributors' dollars - said the Republican congressman Darrell Issa of California.
His Democrat colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures urged the same ones responsible for the demorrowing of the Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, national industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to last month's prices and by 12.9 per cent compared with prices in August 2007 - the Central Statistics Office (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1 per cent for those in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent for those in the previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent for the previous month and by 3.2 per cent for the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased only to a minimum, with 0.1 per cent.
The domestic sales prices in the processing industry increased to a minimum, with a 0.1 per cent increase in July.
The increase in prices increased in August 2008 in the leather and shoes production sector (2.8 per cent), primarily due to an increase of 4.6 per cent monthly of bags and cents and an increase of 2.5 per cent of shoes.
The highest price of basic plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production range (1.6 per cent).
A decrease in prices in the petroleum sector (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as in at least - in the wood processing sectors (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, editorials and printers have not changed.
In the rest of the processing industry, price increases were recorded between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent an important weight within internal trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was registered in August, primarily as a result of the increase in official prices from the first July.
In comparison with a period of twelve months - in national sales of the processing industry sectors - the higher price increases were recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the food, drink and tobacco industry there was an increase of 11 per cent.
Price reductions were recorded in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
During the last year in the processing industry, prices increased globally by 10.2 per cent.
The prices of electricity, gas supply, heat and water exceeded 18.7 percent of the prices of the previous year.
In August, among the different sectors of domestic trade, the monthly increase in prices (0.7 per cent) was recorded in investment goods.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in the prices of the energy sector and the intermediate sectors there was no change over the previous month.
In August 2008, with regard to the same month of the previous year, the higher prices were produced in the energy sectors and in the intermediate industry (16.8 per cent).
A decrease of 6.8 per cent in consumer goods was recorded in the producer branches and an increase of 1.4 per cent in investment goods was recorded.
The export prices of the industry calculated in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent over the previous month, and compared with 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent.
The cost of our national currency in one month was reduced by 1.7 per cent for the euro and by 7.1 per cent for the dollar, compared with August 2007 by 7.5 per cent for the euro and 15.9 per cent for the dollar.
The next year will no longer need to be visited to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities that the North American-Hungary Agreement on the Granting of visas will enter into force on 12 January – the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke of it in Chicago, in front of Hungarian residents there.
In its opinion, "in almost everything depends on the time being built on the other side of the Atlantic the electronic system of access and control".
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the entry premium would disappear, but tourists should register before leaving the country of origin.
From now on, the head of Hungarian diplomacy holds talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed by the State Secretary of Condoleezza Rice by handing the Median Cross with the Star of the Order of the Republic of Hungary and supporting negotiations with the international policy advisers of candidates to the presidency, the Barack Obama Democrat and the Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial savings package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates to the presidency of the two major North American parties, assured their support on Sunday for the $700 million banking aid programme in the administration, while there were politicians asking for the Minister of Finance to resign.
The representatives of the Congress and the administration, after several March-day negotiations, announced on Sunday morning: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial redemption package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and decoupling the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, when the economic issues were first put in place, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared from McCain's advantage that he had obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidate for vice-presidentship.
In a myth of Detroit's campaign, held last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would soon adopt the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) is at risk of employment, the saving of you. In addition to entire industries and the stability of the whole economy," he said to a crowd of 35 thousand people.
Do not take advantage of the opportunity to qualify for obsolescence of McCain's economic concepts.
In an interview given to ABC McCain, he explained that "all of us will bring this to severe punishment (...) but doing nothing simply is not a viable path."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee to the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the remuneration of executives, which he stressed.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, rather he consulted the Minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi stated on Sunday that Congressmen would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
German-speaking printing journal
The right-wing group is intact, only within the same group became the most conscious electors - says Der Spiegel on the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a rojine coalition.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Baviera Revolution Deploys Your Parents" analyzes the reasons for the CSU's broken drama.
According to a well-known politician, the CSU erosion had begun long before the sad two Beckstein-Huber had assumed its role.
Social Christians have been developing in Bavaria for several decades - and now just these modern citizens are the ones who support it.
The change of one era is at the same time a problem for all Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
The failure was not completely surprising for the CSU, but the Sunday ended a process that had been planned for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU received a 47.7 per cent, for the first time, less than 50 per cent since the fifty-five years .
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the resulting modernization of the CSU in the fruitful province of its progenitors .
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but in the pace they have made a lot of mistakes. However, the secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had a negative impact on the integrity of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases the possibilities and it also has political consequences.
The right group is intact, only within the same group became the most conscious, more critical and more mature voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks the conventional groups of citizens have just been those who have been more away from the CSU; autonomouss, small industrials, those who have bachillerates and diplomats.
Thus, less than 40 per cent of CSU's support was rejected.

Vienna's Conservative Journal: "Who is with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved for coalition issues" - it is concerned about the confusing situation of internal policy after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OVP.
The SVP prohibits the involvement of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, greens in exchange still do not want to consult on coalition.
The elections were already held, now all around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties were left to see something of their ranks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the SVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - that is already in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question standing that if you could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÜVP, in the vice-president's place.
He said they did not approve Schüssel-Molterer's era anyway.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Mutterer reacted cautiously to the red bids.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere with the internal affairs of the ÜVP.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within the OVP itself.
The President of BZÖ, Jörg Haider, showed openness in all directions.
"To prevent red-black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government," said Haider.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, its host France is also the vice president of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party by the Fidesz, called attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious violations that afflict the Roma children, and it is also the biggest obstacle to predicting their interests.
This high-level conference was launched - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organizations.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Group of Fidesz in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, the Gitans remain out of the labour market primarily by their low level of schooling.
"Most young Gytans have not finished secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a significant part can get university degree."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role to play in predicting the establishment of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Gytan children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the euro Membership, these issues need to be widely conscious both between the Gypsies and the non-Gytans.
As soon as the school starts a guitar student, there will be more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gigans, as citizens of the European Union, must ensure the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - Lívia Járóka stressed.
According to the euro Membership, the European Union's objective and active unit is needed to speed up the school disintegration process immediately, so it is essential that the proper implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be implemented.
"There is a need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, which has to offer the children of Guyana the opportunity to guarantee democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Járóka demanded.
The aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, organised annually since the Berlin meeting last year, which was held in the sign of the European Year of Equal Opportunities, is to ensure a single forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equality of opportunities at European and national level by Member States.
CSU: Thank you for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be taken on the outcome of the failed two Huber-Beckstein
Despite the heavy electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut in the heads of the brave CSU, the debate on personal issues has now been resumed.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, the first provincial minister is still in his position, but he does not know how long the grace will last.
The success of the two, which suffered an electoral defeat of 17 per cent, will be decided at the extraordinary convention of the party to be held at the end of October.
Integraters of the two criticised were left to intervene: they won't get to their posts so much.
They thus sought to calm the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who one day after the "bavaro tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the majority.
Five years ago - even under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the social union reached a 60.7 percent, in turn now, a year after the attack against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent gained.
The CSU for 46 years had a "monopolio" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of the German GDP.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservationists continue to dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to co-operate with someone.
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister for Agriculture, one of Huber's possible successes, also has a position in the reduced intelligence group that initiates negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Free Right Elections on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the fate is that on the list of the Free Elections, Gabriele Pauli entered the parliament, whose action against Stoiber was used to attack both Huber-Beckstein and then severely removed from the stage to the ambitious local policy.
The CSU's top leaders are now inverting all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
The transition will also have an active role to play in Stoiber that has so far been moving in the background, the former provincial government chief and former President of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the worst day of his political career.
Monday Huber made some critical comments to the CDU, in his opinion they had deserved much more support from the brother-in-law.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and for Angela Merkel itself.
Following the election of the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel cannot be canceled if it is not possible to highlight with the CSU that has played a crucial role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, that severe penalties could conceal his disappointment because of the failure, the losses of the CSU would not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
What is, of course, relative: it will not be easier to deal with the injured CSU and the crisis of social democracies continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst results since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition in the Belarusian parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexander Lukashenko, in exchange for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is better explained by the violations of the law made during the voting.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the law of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated by hundreds and ten Members, has not been opposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections, the combined opposition under the name of the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODSZ) was expected that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of doubt of legitimacy, would, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution, "allowed the entry of some Members of the opposition to parliament."
So ODSZ removed the boy who originally wanted to do it.
On the basis of the opposition's expectations was what Belarus, which is more economically dependent on Russia - which has taken a credit to moderate the imports of natural gas ever closer to Russia and which has contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, a gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow it to enter Lukasenko and the other high-level policies by having an anti-democratic political regime.
It was a sign of separation when the OSCE, when assessing the electoral campaign, placed more emphasis on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the prohibition of participation in a third of the candidates for the opposition.
However, the OSCE monthly primary report even criticised the own campaign - in which the candidates of opposition could not appear in the press - and in particular that opposition could not be present in the contents of the votes.
With all this in view of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is facing a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus is theoretically a federal state - has been regarded as two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one forward, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has been launched - said our journal Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the 2006 presidential election candidate, it is desirable to maintain this situation, although "the regime is afraid to allow even an opposition in that Parliament without weight".
The opposition did not plan to organize protest demonstrations to see the results, rather trying to reach voters with their message on the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes many problems because we must print the pressure of opposition in Russia, the local authorities make difficulties for their distribution, but I also see that they are increasingly those who support the change among older people as well - Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which believes its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate even for the young, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time for the decomposition of social security that "sees the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
Russian observers against the opposition's policy qualified as democratics to the elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Community Mission of Independent States, declared to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts," so that the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony to the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you'll try again before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi that put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
But from today it starts with this measure against who it is and then goes to the bar to take a coffee in working hours.
This novel has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the minister needs.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency is opened.
This is Reformism," he said again, Brunetta.
With Palacio Chigi, the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi "the selection of automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found by employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there has been cooperation among them."
Finally, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and mediocre.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, by smiling, "a good hat at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister stated that "in three months the absence of public employees' diseases has been reduced by 50 per cent, i.e. 60 thousand more people per year".
It adds that the Public Administration needs to make it more effective
Italy, "which wage dynamics – explains the Minister – in the past 8-10 years have been double with regard to the private sector and well above the inflation rate."
For now, millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta decree in response to the request supported by the Code.
"As the Minister of the Public Service shows the numbers, the least austenism of work for disease causes – writes the association of consumers – the people of the 'vago workers' are increasing continually.
In fact, in Italy, there are millions of employees of the proper and productive public administration who have joined to declare war against the illegal rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar will challenge the exclusion of economic treatment aggregated by illness due to service; the extension of the time-limits in which medical visits to the patient are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister's wishes.
Labour accidents, Napolitan: "Crucial Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail's data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and cause almost twice the deaths for the murders.
To call attention to the institutions, social and media information on this dramatic issue, Anmil now celebrates 58th national day in all provinces of Italy by victims of labour accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data distributed by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial it is to prevent work," said the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitan, in a message sent to the president of Anmil, a national association that is mutilated and invalidated by the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expressed his appreciation for the ongoing partnership effort in favour of prevention at the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and awareness-raising of the public opinion.
"It has been demonstrated, a 'blast', which is truly shared, in the face of tragedies that, by its size, provokes the complaint of the media and the participation of the public opinion, instead of the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitan does not hide that "there is no doubt a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
It means taking the many initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention of the phenomenon alive, not to suppress the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has stressed " how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which violates the conscience of each of us and imposes a decisive effort on all institutions to put an immediate end to it."
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive move, but this does not eliminate the number of white deaths as impressive as it is," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want, in fact, this "reduction tendency" to be translated into less attention, because it is just when attention decreases that triggers tragedy.
"We believe that at the general level it is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, for our criterion - has highlighted Mercandelli – more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this is from the school world " .
"Serves a further effort - has been added - as to how to understand the communication and sensitization of public opinion.
But, above all, it serves as a greater sense of responsibility for employees in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidized protection provided for the victims of work" and "the desirability of assistance towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The aim is to restore to the worker the guarantee of insurance - has been aggregated – because the success of the accident does not have to depend on the timely response by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers under the charge, risk the hearing
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent injuries to the audience.
This is the case with the European Commission, which, in a communication published in Brussels, mentions the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risks (Cssseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - read in the note - it is said that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour a day having the high volume device will have a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable music and high-quality audiophones can unwittingly ruin their ears," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Of the scientific evidence – follow Ue's responsibility – emerges a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What is important is raising awareness of consumers and making this information public.
In addition to the existing systems of control in the light of this scientific opinion, we must re-examine them so that they can be widely effective and take the step with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that is causing it.
"Scientists - the conclusion of the Ue Executive – confirm that it is a cause of concern and the European Commission will now consider with the Member States and interested parties which measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from the noise caused by portable musical devices and appliances".
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits 100 dB to the noise level of portable musical devices, but concerns increase as the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit many of these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and time of exposure to noise.
In his view, the Scientific Committee notes that when users of portable music devices listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week, they exceed the current limit for the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music under these extended periods will suffer a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10 per cent of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, Germany leads the Commission to the future of capital
Today begins, in March, in June the accounts will be taken.
This is the calendar established by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Committee for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in their new headquarters behind the terms of Caracala.
Within six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the joint board and council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official well" of the municipality and its intention Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – he intends to underline Germany – he will have to make proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the meeting and the municipal council can then be evaluated.
There are no more roles, only the desire to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time-limit.
In June – announces the intention – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of Rome's capital".
To whom the Commission claims to be useless, since its opinions are not binding, Germany answers: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as will France with the Attal Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
It is almost always a matter of policy in ordinary management and in emergencies that are re-examination.
We, on the contrary, want to look further there and for a long time, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
Rome's intention is to point out further that "this Commission is not a useless entity or a ban: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and it will serve to participate and reason for the best while expressing capital."
For Germany, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immotive, in order to allow our city to make a genuine level jump, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a united spirit in its future."
A future that, needs Rome's intent" would not only be limited to the current municipal boundaries but also looked beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and must develop as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first American president.
He wrote an American political note that he was interested in passing on independently: "Barack Obama will be the second president of the United States.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, reduced the U.S. economy and tube relations (as it does today from a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
They increase attacks against Obama as far as the date of the elections.
Miami's wife wrote in a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he thinks he will win the highest rank of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the electoral question: will they be a good president? And they are also the polls; everyone says Obama wins and with a good advantage.
There is also in this case who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A daily newspaper of Mississippi, in the interiors of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we will know who will vote for the American patriot.
Go out one side of the U.S. mindset covered up to the last one.
"Tell them what they want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama comes to win, we're going to America.
things you've never said before, which seems almost true to the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these reasons, however, the winning weapon for democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the errors made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home to the rear.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make the elections.
Similarly, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak point.
Whoever will take George W's position will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in journals it is time to cut down. Many blame the Internet, "assina" of the printed paper.
Fifteen American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
However, today journalists are almost all pessimists about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastating economic model crisis.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the editors work for the periodical, it is a big problem.
It is a problem to be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if traditional journalism as it is understood by the majority of the public is substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today about the U.S. journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Anti-emission undertaking.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
Most editorial houses open a bridge on the Internet, for many view as the "assino" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79 per cent.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are exaggerating technology in the hope of "doing something good" by journalism.
The biggest rotation in American journalism today is among those who run journals – whether the directors – and journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of national executives are assured that their journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23 per cent.
For some this has to be seen with "work safety."
Executives who consider losing their job in 3 years are 47 per cent at national level.
For the periodic staff is 30%.
The "secure work" at staff level (new editors, etc) in America is always the order of the day.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work with a contract.
In a vast nation like the US, with 300 million people and millions of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employees often offer what they want and become in a matter of "tomorrow or loose".
Directors receive almost always good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but the retirement and social security.
For holidays, the reasoning is complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But U.S. journalists, by their permission, are "skinned" followed during the year.
It's all a climate issue.
UNIPOL: THE TRIBUNAL OF ROME, DANILO COUPPOLA AND GROTTATERRATA
The President of the second criminal section of the Roman court, Carmelo Rinadou, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate worker Danilo Coppola who had requested permission to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppled this banknote in the area of research on the anti-contract with regard to the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arrest process , last week , he obtained domestic release, transforming it into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate owner to travel the city of the province to a capital room.
According to the court, these trips (for which pm has voted against) would allow you to influence your society and access to the evidence they accuse you of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been shown a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans were, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
We are confirmed by the New York Times yesterday, informing us that the current crisis is at the disposal of the Republican party, more and more divided between its old East-East soul, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, in exchange, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, especially in the states of the Central and South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotential with the vote of who spoke at the beginning.
This is just an example of the changes, of the major changes, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Whether in the United States or in Europe since then, the crisis seems to work as an acceleration of inflation phenomena that with the new climate are solidified and brought to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary reactivation of the dual state-superiority category in relation to a renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is a crisis of banking institutions which have strong financial relations with the outside, but above all, the balance of families living in a single country and in a single state is much more committed.
What immediately creates a political problem for whom you will rule: how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and of those families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears globally but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of play or do not have much to say: the crucial proof is that the European Union is always divided between the different interests and the different state strategies cannot decide any policy in common.
It is from the Government of each State that all are expected to intervene, rescue and rehabilitation plans, new rules and, above all, fund subsidies: from the moment the court comes, it is only the state that has economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy matters.
They also have the necessary means and legitimization to use: two incalculable value resources, values under certain circumstances in which no market is likely and no organization can ever be available at the same time.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-nation is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance as long as the new economic development tends to attach it to a very linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of technology ever more sophisticated, inmaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have to change our accounts every time but with little in-material things like water, crops and oil.
All things that can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are also completely united in a circular space, a territory.
So whoever is found to be a sovereign, certainly has many more letters about him who is not, and who has the difficulty of living in a place without cultivation, without oil and without water.
I'll get to the second news, but I'll get a break.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politicians and Leaders.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective consciousness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who is unable to take the situation into hand.
On the other hand, there is a wave of mistrust for existing leaders, of an inadequate economic nature with many dark areas.
And together with something deeper and in a certain worrying sense: a mistrust, intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire class of Western countries in a growing number.
It seems more and more, in various places of the population, that before their actions are the same as those of social elites so far, the same way to feel and be, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, having done their own time and being more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, has been subterraneanly fed by a ramparted but powerful movement of delegitimization of the leading classes and traditional political structures, which are shown in a electoral "revulsion" or the recent recent changes of collective humours, from the conservative exit in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and also the victory of the right in Italy that has something to see).
It has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rhythms, their periodics, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say something, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then represent, what has been taking shape since today is the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis is renewed, increasing and potentially rising.
In the face of all of this, a "mass rebellion" today is quite widespread.
But having the eyes open certainly isn't.
The super footing to walk on the walls
Win the laws of gravity thanks to a great trapping and in the future walking on the walls like the orange man.
It is the objective of several American research centres and now a team of four institutions has been close enough.
With an adhesion of just 2.5 square centimetres, scientists have been able to hold a 100 kilograms body on a vertical wall.
EL STUDIO – American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of the existences that use a particular carbon structure called carbon nanotubs.
"The beginning of the grip can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a spaghetti pill," explains zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the patterns of geeks, recovered from microscopic skin that can ensure perfect adhesion for the animal.
The tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and lily paper, have shown that the new adhesion is ten times more powerful than the patterns of this reptil and at the same time "is easily separated from the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University Engineering.
CAMINAR FOR THE PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transitional aid" adds Liming Dai.
Can you walk through the walls exactly like the orange man? Yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use than the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubs are heat and electric current drivers.
Other applications might have to deal with space engineering.
For the moment, no superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesion.
In an article in the magazine American Chemical Society, Californian students have presented an adhesion made of microfibre like hair that cleans dust during the movement on a surface to maintain perfect adherence.
Farms: Never with fruit game
Attention to the game of pommel, naranja and manganese.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken concomitantly with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or reducing, as appropriate, the effectiveness with severe health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices, freshly associated with the assumption of some medicines, David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, who has been sending a new alarm from the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a single piece of apple, orange and manganese game to reduce the absorption of some drugs, canceling the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The pomelo game was already under charge because it was held responsible for increasing toxic levels of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, anthiolytic, antihistamines and neurological medicinal products.
Pharmacoas A RIESGOS – The same Italian drug agency had reported in a two-year-old information package, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mixture and to pay attention to what is being used in the case of a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT only THE POMELO – Experts also say that the narn and manganese game contains substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active principles inhibited by pommel and other games.
From here, the call by Michele Carruba, director of the Department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan: "These findings are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that are likely to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrated leaflets of the medicines that are being taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, don’t let us be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly» the expert of the Ansa agency stressed.
The Novel of the Economy to Paul Krugman
The noble prize of the economy has been assigned to American Paul Krrugman for his studies, his models of trade and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a Kenyan neo who teaches Princeton University and is an editorialist note from the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical decisions of Bush administration regarding the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the attack of 11 September 2001, in those days that broke Enron, Krugman had planned in a editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
It is a vision that has come true and that for several years wine has been denied to the economy, but that it has now been revealed correctly.
"I am surprised and a little upset about how the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom has quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman had said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a disclaimer with a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excessive liberalism of Bush administration".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Micro" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the familiar Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by the volunteer developers, whose supports are monitored by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: on the reception screen and on the smaller magazine interface, other more consistent additions are added, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also comes to many functions with Office 2007 support, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
It interests some specific functions of some modules such as those that allow you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphical design module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create hybrid PDF documents, which combine the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text manufacturer.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, several users can intervene, avoiding conflicts of amendments, in the drafting of texts, to each contributor is given a colour in the comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to carry some of OpenOffice's functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/Download/3.0.0/Download300.html and added to the English found in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The request may also be sent to the installation cd at home or at work.
And if the issue of free may be a challenge for distribution in the homes, it is in business that Open Office will try the follow-up, try the great deal, and can already count on several projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Write, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint presentation; Dbase, as in the case of known Access is the program that is capable of working on the base date; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand by today, with the output of the new version is likely to exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also positive result is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the French tour: it is from Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-classed and winner of the top floor of the climber.
The news is the site of the newspaper The Team.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the third generation's third-generation Epo', after the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples comes between those carried out in the last few weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the opposition confirms that it is positive, Austria will lose the third position in the Tour and be angry with the two years of canon decalculation.
To confirm Kohl's positive doping news to the third generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency Pierre Bordy, who has declared the Associated Press to have notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has been positioned in the podium at the shoulders of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, helping to overcome the most scalable.
Immigrants: New YORK TIME IS PREGENT, ITALIA IS RACIST?
It has recently become only a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hospitality.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? Is that what New York Times is asking in a long article that has been dedicated to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre of Burkina Faso who killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a gallery box.
This is evident from what New York Times defines as the "paradoja of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where they register "more integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrants feeling of the country and the higher support of the North League".
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also mentioned the outbreaks of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation of the Law also opens the border on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine prisoners is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The trend is marked by the Pope as the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedetto XVI at Congress, has requested that the State and the church work together to combat racism."
Student victims of the expensive rental, up to 900 euros per room
The buyers' market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the union of villagers, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already taken very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the high costs that the family would have to support – explains the responsibility of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has completely distorted the market at this point to trigger a process of generalised growth to the residents."
In most cases, rental offers contain a series of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, with no canon limit, under linked rentals.
There is a need for special interventions for Sonia that can be regulated through the revision of the tax burden.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, by a bed in Brianza area, approximately 450 euros are served; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence an average bed of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bolonia, where students focus on areas near the University, they serve EUR 250/280 per bed in a double room and 370 to 500 per person.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) they ask you about 600 euros for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per individual room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The economy is made only if the peripheral area is changed: 300 euros per bed and 450 per individual room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding areas.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, a room spends from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari per bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 per individual.
in cities but girls prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of renting students and extra-Community students is more frequent, further anomaly is recorded: an increase of 25/30 per cent of the canon to foreign students with respect to Italians.
Adios to Old cinema Paradise, cities cancel historical rooms
Historical cinematographic rooms close by favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore is effectively photographing what is happening in the great Italian cities and also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great mechanists in the peripheral and the resulting disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all features of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historic places, full of memory," as if a friend died, a familiar one who shared a piece of space and so much emotion," observes the director of the new Paradise movie, the film that twenty years ago won the first Oscar and the great prize of the jury to Cannes, who counted the wealth of a provincial cinema and nostalgia in the way of living the movie that was lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main trader association, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and most of them are mostly rooms in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 less in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions by the castles are the first, Emilia-Romana with 82 less cinemas, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for his disappearance is the adventure of the multiplex, these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new Mexican cinemas: 195 screens but in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Toscana than in Emilia-Romana.
"Italian exercise has been radically developed," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall is closed, not all of its users are willing to move to the meths.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favour of traders: the former debt of the state is around EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral viewpoint that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
In order to support the sector, it would serve between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million a year.’
In the case of Bolonia, the first Italian city concerned by the castles, decided to repair with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of which is in Italy to promote and maintain the mono-room cinema is in the historic centre than in the peripheral.
Among the prescribed standards are average tax relief for public managers and benefits in terms of mobility: inspectors may enter the restricted traffic area and have special rates for parking.
"It is an initiative I like," observed Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by taking other measures.
It is true, that in contrast to the extra power of mechanics, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public is more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the film in Baghia, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the chip that convinced me to perform the "New Paradise movie", which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I move forward to the Realto or the Quirinale of the National Road already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so that I don't see the cards ignored by the dust, I turn to the other side.”
Lazo between politics and dandangheta, has been arrested by the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to unify the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromelli castle."
The charges are heavy that the judges of the Anti-Calabria Anti-Calabria Directorate give the intent and the intent of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torione and Rosario Schiavone, and the intention of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by a massive association.
Also arrested by Gioacchino Piromalli, the medieval elder between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, homonymous of the boss, already condemned by a massive criminal association and rewarded 10 million euros.
"Regarding any legal and moral standards, and with good reason," the prosecutors wrote, the two local authorities had expressed their willingness to pay consultation with the attorney Piromelli.
"It would have been allowed to the mafiosa family – the judges – to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of public administration."
The president of the Calabrés regional meeting Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between bad life organized have a monasteries" in his region: "There are areas where massive intensity is stronger than others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the dragongheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning are added to those of the past July after the police had announced the court of heads of the mafiosa family Piromalli.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been subjected to the administration of the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, intent on, from Udc at the time of the resolution, after the vote in May 2006, had been elected head of a right-wing coalition.
I blow a scandal when the Prefecture orders the municipal council's resolution.
I call on the Deputy Minister of the Interior who was Marco Minniti at the time, accusing him of organizing everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had been able to request the variation of the A3 road project.
Of the environmental interviews made in Dal Torreone, the judges wrote, "the availability of an entrepreneur, a representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families."
When energy is born of the waves, the big ones descend to the stage
It's an out-of-the-art heating that covers more than 70 per cent of the planet's surface and is now being discovered, the world's major energy companies.
Oils, corals, corals are the new renewable sources on which the great ones like Chevron look.
The potential to recover energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s together with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the low oil price, in 1980, the idea of using marine energy was split, but now the environmental cases and the new increase in oil had prompted the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated for 2007 that 15 per cent of global electricity needs could be covered by plants that exploit the movement of marine oils.
This amount would be the double of the currently produced by nuclear power stations.
And they would also be the currents and the tides.
Gigantic attack.
The first undertaking to invest on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced there seemed to be a revolutionary step.
At two years of distance on marine energy are always but among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying oceanic energy technology – he has declared the portfolio of a company associated with the U.S. oil column in the Wall Street Journal – and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
Cooperation in question is about obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to operate marine energy in Alaska.
It is a very important sign, if it is considered that the US continues to extract oil in Alaska and President Bush has recently launched a plan to perform new perforations.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey following the way of the energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicates an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are still talking about a technology at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt had a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts such as those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create great problems in the ecosystem.
To produce long-scale energy, a technology should be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the options are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good unity between them.
The force of the waves, which moves the wells up and down, turns into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
Pressure causes a turbine to turn into a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
There are now four implants of this type in development ways, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, which could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, in turn, generates energy for a commercial center and for a station, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are seams, makes turn of the turbines, creating a girator movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant said he had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, said in the Institute for the Development of Electricity, now deserves the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, mothers are more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is particularly about the energy of the seas that you are in New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others who are near the coast, have invested $7 million and half a million dollars in 2008 and is expected to invest 35 million for 2009.
