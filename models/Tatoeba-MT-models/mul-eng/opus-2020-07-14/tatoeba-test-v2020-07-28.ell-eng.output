I don't think I'm ready for the investigation.
Mary's answer to the teacher's question.
They'll fix him.
We don't have a school tomorrow.
Rome wasn't set up in one day.
I like to dance.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have any secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than me.
Tom is now living in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep laughing.
I refuse to let that happen.
Good morning.
Do you like the chimpanzee?
You look disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We're talking a lot.
Tell me what you're gonna get in the exams.
I don't think two languages are enough.
Can you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's sick.
I think we should tell them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come and see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to the church with the car.
You're much smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom doesn't laugh.
Amy's coming home at three.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to know French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed Mary wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I won't lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom is teaching me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell you I'm innocent.
That's not my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a student of the famous Judas.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with this.
They're gone again.
Tom would do everything for you.
Is it okay?
Who's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I know where you're working?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who is this?
We have to tell him.
His escapes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to catch Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They're pregnant.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We've built the house in green.
The time and place of the meeting have closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I got promotions recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please close the door.
The skin's good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He loves him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I forgot.
I wish I wasn't Canada.
What's missing is not gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
He's pushing my cell phone.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom is a head higher than me.
Where can we buy it?
It's 2:30 now.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was from his house.
Where's the fire?
You threatened me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Who's that?
Tom forgot his suitcase on the train.
They killed our rats.
My name isn't Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom's staying in Boston.
Thomas's staying in a neighborhood with cats.
The water is hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
It was urgent.
You're eating a lot of candy.
Has anyone come?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom's gonna live.
It was too late.
That's not fish.
That's a statement.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canada?
People today are more important to popular culture than in the past.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you wash your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love it.
I swim every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
Did you shoot him?
We may need some.
This is a proposal.
How'd you get the break?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them in the evening.
Oh, we've got an invitation?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed too.
Tom's house has been destroyed all the time.
Tom took Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
You know who he is?
Did you see the baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
It's the same to me whether it's coming or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You killed him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live as humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be late.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I love you, Tom.
Let me explain my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to make a sport.
Tom was alive.
Theoma's phone hit, but he didn't.
Can you teach me French?
The price was excessive.
Almost.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myth?
It's over 40.
What time did you leave?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
Our captain has set us up well.
Go with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to beat her with love songs.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom's got Marie.
Aren't you going to Australia to build a store?
What do you call that?
Larry's still in school.
My office is in the center of town.
He's got two brothers.
You're not Canada.
I trained Boston many years ago.
Tom rejected Mary.
Tom's got a good brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed in Boston three nights.
I'm starting to find you beautiful.
I don't want to wait so long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letters are written by the girl.
Someone's been crying.
He didn't go to bed.
He speaks French fluently.
I'm higher than you.
Have you lost your proof?
Are you afraid you don't lose your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom's coming back?
Tom has no red hair.
Can I borrow your earphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm an impostor.
I think Tom's drunk.

We're very busy.
More powerful, please.
You're my friends.
Please breathe from your mouth.
The company cancelled the project.
"Fires!" he cried.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're easy.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
That was the last client.
Do you like white wine?
They made a mistake.
I say it and I repeat it.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like the scars.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That won't be forgotten.
Russia is big.
The woods are friendly.
You ruined her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for a long time.

You thought I was Canada?
I'll be with you.
I haven't got an answer in my letter.
Can I borrow your credit card?
Are they all ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I read it.
I want to talk to Tom.

Tom is Turkos.
Can you take away from the ten and six?
Don't stop!

When are you going for a break?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.

You're imbecile.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't take part in the debate.
Note: In English we forget the nationalities, the days of the week, and languages.

You were lying.
I trust you.
Aren't you going to Australia to make trouble?
How many times have you kissed Tom?

Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of songs.
They made a decision.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given them to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget that night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.

Mary answered the teacher's question.
Tom said he thought I'd be impressed.
I die at least once a month.

He shot her.
I don't know the Arabic alphabet.
Answer the question.
The problem is you're not Canadians.

Why don't I be surprised?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He's making a lot of money for puppies.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm very excited now.
I thought you were Japanese.
It's very hot here.
Who saw you?
It's bigger than that.
Please take back what I'm saying.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is an expert.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the tallest of the three.
Did you ask them to wait?
She's crying.
He'll work.
I guess you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.

Here?
Where did you find the key?
Can that not be true?
Tom doesn't deal with the hot and cold summers here, and that's why he went up to the mountains.
Bill, take the phone with you tonight.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please, tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
It's not Italian?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's just leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a happy experience.

He ran as fast as they could take his feet.

We've built them up.
Tom was impressive.
H Mary's a prisoner with strangers.
We're going to shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I came home.
Life's hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom opened the door.
I'm staying here.
I hope you'll call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk later.
Put the book on the others.
The bird is in heaven.
Tom took Mary.
Mike, how's it going?

I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
It's not hard French.
Someone's calling.
We found her.
Where are you going?
His hair was tight.
Everyone repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language did I speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him up.
Are they Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom go.
How long have you been a teacher here?
Try to stay active.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before nightfall.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a statement.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father is missing.
I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's not back in Okinawa anymore.
I thought you were Canadian.

The price of this car is reduced by 15 percent.
How are you?

This is a Japanese doll.
Take off his glasses.
It's good to dream.
He had a headache.
Who's my boyfriend?
Tom doesn't speak French.

You underestimated me.
Finally, these two continue to be under repair.
Horrey.
I wasn't angry.
That's not my key.
You're doctors.
My decision to study abroad surprised my parents.
The door is at the end of the road.

Why are you so anxious about yourself?
Tom eats food for cats.
The computer is new.
That book is written in French.
Tom's running fast.
Tom put his hands back into his pockets.
Tell him you lied to him.
I've just eaten.
Mary answered the teacher's question.
They wanted to steal the car.
You like my new shirt?
You'll cry.
Who's the title of your new book?
We know each other very well.
Mary doesn't like the truth in Tom, even though she says she likes him.
I'm Richards.
We've been playing baseball.
Tom gave me this letter.
How many students do you have?

The problem is you're not Canadians.
He'll understand.
They've forgiven you.
My patriot is the whole world.
Tom will be ready.
You look busy.

I love Hetomi.
Do you want to be famous?
I forgot to buy flowers in Mary.
I'm not a professional.
Who belongs to this car?
Tell them to leave.
He worked hard.
Tell him to help us.
Tom likes the jokes.
Were you there?
It's working.
I don't like surprises.
Jane was angry.
We'll wait.
I think Tom has three choices.
We'll be together.
Tom agreed to give us a conference.
In our health!
We'll save you.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
Why did you stop?
I thought you were Canada.
Is that the mollusc is yours?
Tom's asking for bread once a week.
I went in.
Let's get him a drink.
I think he's innocent.
Who's your box?
Where's Tom eating in the morning?

That's ours.
We're gonna shut up.
I'm drinking coffee.
That's Tom's.
Are you a fool?
I'll read it.
My brother's late.
Come out.
We're not going to ball, if it's a bad time.
You have to see it to believe it.
I have some money.
She likes the dress.
I think I've printed it.
I woke up earlier than usual.
Tom doesn't believe in God.
Tom's favorite color is blue.
The ice cream will be over soon.
Try not to think about it.
They're not alive.
Where did Tom come from?
Tom said he'd probably go for questioning with Mary this morning.
I thought you could help me.
I should've been with them.
You work hard.
I love the giant potatoes.
When I'm done with what I'm doing, I'll come.
How many days have you been in Boston?
They got there before the age.
Millie's learning chocolate.
The hunter was the killer.
I heard Tom was in Australia.
Tom will help you.
We have two girls.
Just say what you want to say.
You made a lot of mistakes.
You're incredibly stupid.
Did he love you?
I want everyone to stay under the same roof.
We all want to do this tonight.
I miss Boston.
We have three kids.
You're not Japanese.
Tell him I'm ready.
Linda likes to eat chocolate.
Try it.
Thomas hasn't arrived yet.
They claim they're Canadians.
He put the bed and put it on the bed for the beds.
Don't leave me here alone.
Tom and Sue have been known since 1985.
You speak Chinese?
I have two mother languages.
I'm not gonna tell you.
What happened?
We heard the announcement that you went through the tests.
There are happy people and unhappy people.
We're not the only Canadians here.
I'm looking for Tom.
What was I thinking?
Tell them I'm here.
I thought you were Canadian.
I thought you were Canadians.
Where's her family?
Tom runs every day?
Thank you for helping me!
I don't want them.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I want to thank everyone for their prayers.
Open fire!
We went every Sunday to the church.
Tell her we'll be ready.
Can I accompany you as the exit?
He's still studying.
I don't want them.
Tom's gone.
She's not my wife.
I want to know what's in the box.
He's younger than your sister.
When do your breaks begin?
Tom was shocked.
What did you say?
I've already talked to Tom about it.
The Vatican is the smallest state in the world.
I want to drink some water.
I'm not sick.
He was busy.
Get out of my office!
What would you advise me to do?
Tom doesn't hate you.
The computer you're using is late.
I left the door open.
Tell him not to come.
He ate all the honey.
I'm not kidding.
I'm good.
It's different.
I just moved.
What did you expect Tom to buy?
You're smarter than that.
I want this TV.
He's tired.
In an hour, we're going to be over.
I'd like to write a book about Cyprus.
Tom's shooting the table, right?
Tell them your theory.
I could have found my cat if I had done this.

I'm your woods.
Tell her you're sick.
Where are your keys?
Tom died in 2013.
I'm writing a letter to Maria.

I'm sure I'll find a way.
Why are you so sad?

Say it.
As far as I know, Tom could be dead.
Is he smart?
Tom is always willing to help.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Tom and I are both Canadians.
We're students.
Does anyone know Japanese?
Tom's not smart.
He was born rich.
That's a big deal.
Tom agreed tactfully.
I'm playing violins.
Get your things together and get out of here.
You'll be surprised what you can learn in a week.
I don't know where you're going.
I want a green one.
We gotta get out of here.
They told me to wait here.
Why are you so sad?
Tom had to go to school when he was a kid.
They arrested me.
Only we can warm them up.
Maybe someone should like Tom.
She's always working a lot.
You ruined him.
When did you get here?
I know myself very well.
We'll find one.
I told my friends.
I think we could help each other.
I'm staying in Milan.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
Am I your friend?
I can admire other people, but I've never tried to be someone else than myself.
I don't trust women.
I suggest you read this book.
Can you find it?
Please correct the next proposal.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.
What is the most widely read book in the world?
It's in the middle of the line.
Is this book yours?
You're much smarter than me.
Tom is about the same age as you.
That's the goal.
My son's crying very powerful.
Can you take it here?
We need more coffee.
I'm fine, thank you.
I'll be ready.
What are you gonna drink?
What color is your dress?
No one will know.
He decided to cut the cigarette.
We're closing at 2:30.
I never hit Tom.
Looks like he lied.
You won't like what I'm about to say.
When are you leaving?
What time does the system open?
I don't know French.
You ruined him.
From your mouth and from God.
You shot her.
You like them.
Water's not enough.
Does she eat the apple?
You'd better stay here.
Tom's a year older than Mary.
We're all trying to help you.
The girl is beautiful.
I'll come with you.
Where's the money, Tom?
Where are you working?
They're active.
Can you speak my language?
Aren't you going to Australia to make trouble?
I like your shirt.
Tell them I'm ready.
I'm in bed.
Australia is a beautiful country.
Of course, every religion has its own rules.
I know where Tom was born.
Take a walk until you see the highway and then turn right.
You don't have to talk so hard.
Tom's eating a lot.
There were so many people in the room I could hardly move.
It's going to fall.
You're ready.
We recognized it.
He's making diets.
You're sick, you need to rest.
Tom's listening.
I underestimated him.
Are you really Canadians?
I suddenly started taking weight.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
This is Al's book.
It was my husband's idea.
Tom wanted Mary.
I've got ten styles.
I appreciate that.
Have you paid all the bills?
Did you like flowers?
Tom's close.
You told her.
Don't touch the sky of the dog.
Tom's angry with us.
I bought you a red triangle.
Tom made Mary cry.
Get a phone.
You look tired.
Not a lot of people like Tom.
You're stronger than me.
Tom is still in Australia.
I heard you.
Ask tomorrow.
Tom tells me he doesn't care if you like it or not.
To forgive others is an act of kindness to yourself.
My goal is to learn your language.
Are you sure you hit the last bomb?
I thought you were a Canadian.
It was a bad choice.
Take my hat.
I woke up and I saw my wallet missing.
What have you eaten?
I think I'm listening to them.
My neighbor's name is Tom.
I trained Tom many times in Boston.

Why is Tom doing this?
Please don't touch me.
That student is Tom.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
Mary's a smart girl.
Come with me, Tom.
"Are you tired?" "No, not at all."
No one translates my proposals!
I like the jeans.
Tom will decide.
I want you to die.
No one lives there.
Look at my arm.
Tell them not to slow down.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about it?
I'm proud of you.
The sea is green.
It's bigger than you.
Are you kidding me?
Why are you angry?
Tell you I'm ready.
He's a horoscope, though he's a tummy.
The cat is safe.
He doesn't drink coffee.
Do you need them?
He's a man at the door.

The book is open.
We'll put it down.
Do you often give Tom your car?
He had a lot on Rio de Janeiro.

I have to get back to work.
Your kids will be safe with Tom.
Give me another chance.
Let me introduce you.
If time allows, we'll be out tomorrow.

I only have two hands.
We don't have another food.
Tell him you're sick.
Where are you working?

Are you reading?
Please, come at 2:30.
I want to know what you know.
I bought a couple boots.
How many brothers does Tom have?
You'll never be able to find Tom.
I guess you're better than Tom.
And we were both tired.
Thomas knows Mary's right.
I'll bring it to you.
And Tom and Mary are Canadians.
Tom was picked up by the police.
People judge by the color of their skin.

Tom just came back from Australia.
I'll go to the kitchen.

The bottom of the table came all day.
Tom's gonna shut up.
Tom wanted to know what we did.
My balls are still stuck.
I gave him a book.
If you don't leave now, they'll kill you.
Are you kidding me?
I wonder what he said to me.
The door's locked.
This song is for you.
Tom has a daughter.
I've always been there.
He's hot today.
He knows.
I see you have a Greek name.
What's your favorite song?
I've seen a lot of things.
We killed them.

You want to go to Harvard or not?
I'm checking my e-mails.
Tom was punished.

I'm not here.
Let's make a quick break.
It's allowed.
Oh, my God!
The bag wasn't mine.
Tell them why you can't go.

I'll take him if you don't mind.
The Greeks won the party, not for their logic, but for their actors, to warn them to take a deep breath, as they were preparing for a coming big proposal; so a party represents a stop.

Tell them.
You want tea or coffee?
Tell them it's important.
I like your house.
Tom contacted Mary.
Why did Tom buy a new car?
Tom wore a white shirt.
Tom would've been over my ass.
You were perfect.
How much do you want?
The distributions do not need to correspond to a natural amount. Anything can be a distribution space enough to determine the addition of the broadcasts and the multiplication with a large size.
I haven't seen a thermophiliac in here a week.

You tried.
You're making a mistake, I didn't say that.

Millie's going to school.
Do you have money?

Wash your teeth after every meal.
Tom gave Mary good advice.
He's buying the computer.
Can you make a toast?
I like that shirt mummy.
I'm talking to you.
The triangles in my garden are beautiful.
I'll accompany you.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
We're always making a mistake.
What if something went wrong?
I thought you were at work.
He likes superstition.
Tom told Mary to get up.
The worst is over.
Tom just finished writing a letter to Maria.
There's a hospital near here.
Is Mary Tom helping her?
He gave me a roll.
I'm shy.

I didn't want milk.
I'm not going to disappear.
Got it?
It's Sunday today.
What are you going to leave behind?
He doesn't have a gun.
Tom doesn't often come here.
One more step, and I'd have been gravitated.
I haven't tried.
He's a man at the door.
Where's Tom?
Tom said he liked snow.
I'm talking about yourself, please.
Our wives are Polish.
Our people don't go on a train in the oven.
Most people want to hear only their own truth.
You were lying.
When are you going to Japan?
Where's Tom?
Tom saw me.
I'll be with Tom.
I can't do anything for you.
You're drunk!
I'll be ten years next month.
That's for you, Tom.
I'm afraid of you.
We're all Canadians here.
This is an inexhaustible approach.
I don't like this town at all.
Tom has a son and a daughter.
Maybe he's changed.
I married a Canadian.
Tell her you don't need it.
I called her for the movie.
The dog eats a honey.
Tom tried to comfort his wife.
You don't want to talk to me, do you?
A good dress ensures a meeting but a good mind a meaningful relationship
Who blew the car?
This likely affected their decision.
Tom is better in French than in English.
I remember them.
Are you working this morning?
I don't know how Tom gets out.
There's no one sitting here.
Are you talking to me?
A small step for man, a giant wave for humanity.
You need to hear the truth.
Tom knows you.
Give me three minutes.
Tom wants to stay here.
I'd like a glass of orange.
I'm siding my body.
That's not true.
We demand action, not words.
Everyone went to the same bar.
Who's Tom talking about?
Tom told Mary he always lived in Boston.
There are many refugees in Iceland.
We'd have more if we had more time.
Let's order two bottles.
I'm weak.
I finally found a job.
Don't leave me like that.
Tom's back from Australia.
Excuse me, what time is it?
It doesn't surprise me.
I'll give you Tom's address.
When did you get back from Tokyo?
Tom told me he'd like to fix Boston.
Tell him I'm not gonna do this.
The first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, the seventh, the eleventh, the tenth... the last.
I don't remember how he took her to his little girl.
I'll remember that.
Your French are improving.
I'm not wasting my time.
Tell him why you can't go.
Come with me to the southern shores of France!
Tom forgot his suitcase in the train.
I took his father's hat off to make a doggie.
I just finished.
He's not Algerian.
When Tom comes, I'll pay the money I promised.
First the immigrants, then you, our solidarity is a response to social exclusion.
Can you hold this line?
Can you smell the cheese?
I don't like taking a risk.
Tell them to go and worry.
Tom is higher than me.
Do what you think.
Stop there.
I'll talk.
Are you sure?
Her eyes were red from the bed.
Are you taller than Tom?
I went to the park with Mary last night.
I'm the only one who didn't have to.
He's smart.
I could have done it this morning.
I thought you were Canadian.
He can't even write or read.
I'm sorry, what time is it?
We have three kids.
Tell them to help me.
Tom was dressed like a girl.
How much is the pantelon doing?
I like my coffee to be hot.
Tell you we're busy.
I like the way you think.
Tom refused to listen.
When will he come home?
Tom's good at cooking.
He's an understatement.
Do you have tattoos?
That's the beginning.
- No, thank you, I'm just kidding.
Mary protected her husband.
You're not Japanese.
Oh, my God!
Tom stayed calm.
They say you can usually judge people from the company they have.
We have nothing.
My shoes are bigger than yours.
I'd like you to miss the meeting tomorrow.
We like music.
Can you slow down a little bit?
I don't have a girlfriend.
The new ones were happy.
I visited her in Germany.
Tom's already gone home, but Mary's still here.
Tom's drinking coffee.
We don't drink.
We all made a mistake.
This Saturday we can make free calls.
You don't have your eyes closed.
I wanted to die.
Where's your wife?
Did you follow?
I can read without a glass.
Tell me your address.
We have what we deserve.
Let's talk about it.
You don't trust me, do you?
My job is to teach English.
That brings me great joy.
Tell them I'm not gonna do this.
I like Boston very much.
I'd like to help you.
I'm sick of shit.
You'll be safe with Tom.
He tried to tell him to help us.
Excuse me, speak English?
You're late last night.
We're students.
Why are they angry?
I hope she's okay.
I'm a man.
Everyone likes money.
Tom's talking to Mary.
Tom did a lot of great things.
There are five fish in my office.
Tom doesn't drive fast.
Thomas is smarter than Mary.
The style is up in the office.
Are you going to stay?
Tom and I are getting married in October.
Sit down!
I love the beer.
Who were you talking to?
You have to sleep.
Who broke it?
What's your fault?
Apparently Tom's too high.
Wait for me there.
Why don't you help me?
You think you can get me?
Tom was born three months in his grave.
Tom claimed he was innocent.
He's smiling.
Your face is red.
You're not ready.
Tom and Mary are coming here now.
You're not Canada.
He said something.
She advised him to take the medicine.
Tom is my greatest brother.
Don't underestimate me.
He's a fool.
I'm a big fan.
Are you sure Tom's not busy?
Who's sick?
Thomas has a Turkish friend.
I like Jaz.
Tom's got a better mind.
Are you sure you hit the right button?
Good evening!
Are you satisfied?
We sent the products yesterday.
You'll cry.
You have something in your teeth.
How often do you wash your clothes?
Tom has a high moral standard.
I'm in danger.
Tom's got his hands on it.
Tom forgave Mary.
Tell them who we are.
You went to the casino.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake when you speak English.
I can't help you this week.
You don't have to say that when there are children around.
I'll never forget you.
I thought you were Canadians.
We recognized them.
I heard the news on the radio.
Do you miss Tom?
His wife doesn't even know why he died.
You need to see this movie.
He was driving safely.
Tom knows I'm a Canadian.
I lost my card for lunch.
There was no time.
After the accident, the injuries were transferred to the hospital.
We have to finish it until Monday morning.
We have to work very hard.
As you wish!
Who are your parents?
I liked tennis.
And I don't like to wear shoes with the others.
We're planning on attending your party.
Thank you for coming!
Tom sang.
It's funny.
What did you ask him?
He's running now.
It's very interesting for me.
What I want right now is a glass of cold water.
We'd like to order 18 tons of oil.
Tom handles the French well enough.
Why did you shoot her?
Let's keep going.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
She likes flowers.
I think he's a liar.
This elevator can transport ten people at a time.
Freedom is not free.
He teaches us French.
You're sick!
You think I'm a lawyer?
I'm the only one who doesn't want to do this.
We have to push to get to the station early.
What are Tom's priorities?
Tom has a brother in Boston.
I want to talk to you.
Tom decided to go to Australia.
Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom taught Harvard.
It's cold. Why don't you put a bird?
We'll save you.
Are you ready?
Only for adults.
I don't know.
Tom loved Mary.
He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before he left for America.
Come on.
How many letters did you send to Tom?
I've been seeing him for months.
I forgot her attack.
I want you back to Boston.
They're crazy.
You're a liar.
We're not guilty.
I'm drinking milk.
I admire you.
I didn't go to the zoo.
These are my loved ones.
One speaks English and the other Japanese.
When are you planning on getting married?
They're writing.
What can I do about it?
I can't imagine what it means to be there.
It was English.
I didn't have any doubts.
I'm not even tired.
It's beautiful.
What do you want me to say?
Tom doesn't eat red meat.
The roads are covered by snow.
Well, I have a proposal to make.
I don't remember the exact date.
He's smart.
What are you gonna tell them?
He stopped smoking.
When do you eat dinner?
Would you like a glass of red wine?
It's just drinking water.
I can't forget her beauty.
You sell your hands before you eat?
Tom's playing tennis.
Everybody's got secrets.
Don't lie to me again.
I don't have any money.
I like to help others.
What animal is big?
I'll wait until October.
You know how to use it?
They're lucky.
The decision is mine.
You want to tell her?
You hid the truth from me.
His answer was negative.
I understand.
You're still alive.
How long has it been?
Tell her not to come.
Is Tom really a Canadian?
Tom plays tennis every day.
It's not cheap.
She's a very attractive woman.
The bottom is learning.
How can we do that?
You think you could help me celebrate the garden tonight?
I can't eat chicken.
You're very mature.
It's in the spring.
I want to go to Korea.
Tell Tom I'm for a club.
I want an exemption.
I'm tired.
It's my dinner today.
We're willing to negotiate.
The girl wants to know the truth.
Have I ever asked you to work Sunday?
I feel guilty.
He left me alone.
Follow him.
I appreciate the coffee.
There's a doctor.
It's unlikely he's coming today.
My father hasn't eaten dinner yet.
Melanie thinks the situation is very bad.
Tom ignored Mary's warning.
He's rich.
My daughter is Canada.
But I wasn't crazy, I'd buy it.
Wait for us here.
“ Do you speak English? ” — “No, this is my first lesson! ”
We'll die if we stay here.
You want to eat chicken?
I have a friend.
He didn't understand Mary's joke.
Are you going to tell them?
It's very sweet.
Who brought you here?
We've been doing our vacations in the woods.
Who shut the door?
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
Take my wife.
Put your clothes here.
Is Mary your daughter?
I'm not an analyst.
I want the book.
You need to help him.
He's drinking beer.
Today's Theoma's birthdays.
My wife is a doctor.
Someone gave you something.
I'm watching TV.
Tom bought a whole car.
Tom's got a lot of money.
You don't have a way.
Why are you smiling?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
Please don't touch me.
I got you a present.
You're not poor.
We're going to visit Tom.
My colleague and I can do the same job, but he was promised promotion very soon.
Does she like the oranges?
Are you angry with me?
You have to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll wash the dishes.
I like snow.
Tom saw Mary today.
I was born in Boston.
They believe me.
You killed her.
They'll find her.
I don't care about the mountain art.
We killed them.
You're so beautiful!
Tom's famous.
Tom says he needs help.
Why did you shoot them?
He got a lot more than I expected.
Who was right?
I want to watch TV.
I got him.
Speak French.
She's married to a dentist.
We're still shocked.
He'll find it tonight.
I'm the coach.
Who's going to lead?
The park was allowed.
Our dog has lost a rabbit.
Tell Tom we'll be ready.
Tom's playing golf.
Mary's husband is rich.
The triangles smell good.
Welcome to our country!
What's your favorite color?
Tell us about it.
Don't make noise!
I wake up once a week.
Tom's smarter.
Tom started it.
Tom doesn't know where to wait for Mary.
I still love Tom.
That's an amazing result.
I like it, and I need to learn a lot of foreign languages.
I love you, Tom.
Tom's got gray hair.
We shot him.
You got three cars, right?
Tom will find us.
It depends on you.
I don't remember being invited.
Tom stole Mary's role.
What have you got there?
Tom's gonna change.
Where's the envelope?
These windows are not clear.
You're very exciting.
Are the Belgians legally in Australia?
I won't give you ten.
He loves his son.
I'm very disappointed.
He'll protect you.
Was the soup good?
Where did you get it?
Doctors have a difficult problem.
There are three situations in the commercial center.
Keep digging.
I like to help others.
I need water.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
Yankev was very influenced by Borekh's story.
I don't mind them.
He must be an American.
When do we have to deliver the report?
Who stole Tom's car?
We don't want her.
This room is used as a kitchen.
Who are you talking to?
Someone sings.
How long did you eat the first roll?
The flower is ice cream.
I like this room.
But you really want to know, all you need is to ask.
What's this girl?
Get to know him.
He's the hero.
I didn't eat it.
Our shop isn't open.
You underestimated them.
Get her out.
Tom stole Mary's computer.
That's not white.
The man they're talking about has been dead for a long time.
Tom and Mary didn't agree to anything.
I'm desperate.
He's closing me up!
When did you smoke for the last time?
We all agreed with Tom.
Tom's house is close to the beach.
We're going to make a check.
That tea is good.
This is the last warning.
Give us three minutes.
You'll learn to speak English fluently!
That's amazing!
Say it to the Hungarians!
I know his address.
I want to know when the meeting starts.
I know he's lying.
Actually, you're absolutely right.
You like white chocolate?
The lights are coming.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
I'd like to visit Athens's ancestors.
This relationship is very powerful.
You'll be busy tomorrow.
Can you give me a better explanation?
Can you see the stars tonight?
Ask him when he's leaving the next plane.
You're alive.
Look around.
Tom said he knows Mary's secret.
That's the absolute truth.
Did he accept it?
I've got someone to clean up my house.
I'll cook you something.
We found them.
Mary knows what she's doing.
Tom really wants to help.
They did not understand the question.
I hear music.
I'll call you in an hour.
I'm done writing.
I'm in Boston.
I got a valuable lesson.
Where can I find an ATM?
Let's thank him.
I want to get to the hotel before tonight.
He's very sick.
Where's the toilet?
You're the special one.
Tom was killed this morning.
It sounds dangerous.
The tree's right.
I got two fish.
Are you drunk?
Thank you for your help.
I'm an open man.
How was your trip to Australia?
I'll find her.
I'm working at a bank.
I want to go see a movie.
They're teachers.
You're all over.
I want to know what his name is.
Tom's gone.
Why are you so disappointed?
Go to Tom to help Mary.
Call Tom at 2:30.
The dog slept on the couch.
They need you.
How old are your brothers?
Tom bought a car in Mary.
It's almost midnight.
I was right.
Tom studied in Boston.
I'll show you.
He wants to live in the city.
I'll never see you again.
From here and beyond, you should read more.
I've never had such a problem.
Did we?
I'm not very good at this.
Were you alone?
I don't blame anyone.
Tom missed me.
I have to go to sleep.
Tom hasn't called yet.
Tom wanted an exemption.
I need money.
Were you in the army?
You're a good journalist.
You have a good plan.
I'm not going to buy anything today.
How old were you when you left Australia?
Tom killed himself in Boston.
My brother says he's not afraid of the shot.
Goro is good in English.
Is it close here?
Who's got it?
I took back everything I said.
Her daughter's not a good cook.
Don't leave me here alone.
He's a good player.
Tom is my friend.
Tom's parents married in Boston.
What did Tom show you?
Are you drunk?
I woke up early this morning.
Tom's left.
I'll go to the beach.
The bus just left.
I was in the mountains.
I've started to get used to living in Boston.
If you lose your baby in the middle of the night, you're drunk.
Tom's reading French.
It's lucky.
Has the new trainer improved the quality of the team?
We left at 2:30.
Let me do my job.
The smoking is prohibited in the school area.
I don't ask for money.
Don't tell me you're sorry for me.
What direction did he go to?
Tom can't walk.
I'm proud of my brother.
I don't believe what Tom says.
Are we leaving now?
You'll know.
I want to see them again.
They killed him.
You're bigger than me.
We're doctors.
You think you could help me get out of the woods tonight?
Is Tom drinking?
I'm ready to go.
Who died?
Tom runs every day.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
You're Canadian, aren't you?
I'll have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell me I'm not here.
I'm not going to Australia for a year.
Right.
We're honest.
I woke up at five.
Tell them we're ready.
Who taught you French?
Tom had a black cat.
I'll buy one.
Tom would never have done that.
Tom opened three chairs.
We're gonna kill him.
Are you sending him a message?
I'll show you the city.
I want to close the door.
Why did you do that?
He's lost in the woods.
How far from Brno?
Let's hope it works.
Tell me you're sick.
I was hiding.
He's a good man, right?
What are you going to eat today?
Tom's a Canadian.
Are you kidding me?
They have warned us.
Tom's got a lot of brains.
Wait here.
In his eyes, he was perfect.
Can you find him?
It's strong, mature and, prettier, kind.
They're Canadians, aren't they?
I'll learn French.
Tom sings pretty well.
I was tired.
You were perfect.
Tell him it's important.
Why exactly did you do that?
I'm eating.
Try to stay active.
I admire you.
Tom came to Japan from Australia.
He's my best friend.
Let's talk about it.
Your father won't buy it.
He may have his faults, but I'm going.
Tom lost a book.
"There will be live music in Pic-Nick." "What kind of music?"
He did tea.
I would like you to miss the meeting tomorrow.
Don't talk to me about religion.
They don't understand me when I speak German.
I have a apartment in Boston.
Is your car black?
I'd like to work this weekend.
Tom's got his face covered.
Mary's a lucky girl.
Tell him I'm not here.
Tom is the only Canadian I know.
Tom started to dance.
He's my husband.
The Persians are not hard.
Tom's a liar.
I don't blame anyone specifically.
Tom was happy.
Your husband teaches me Italian.
I speak a lot of languages.
Tom shot them.
We're trying.
That's it, isn't it?
You know, the night's death I've got a staff, because it's gonna start a paramedic seminary.
I left the bank with a license.
Why don't you tell them?
Is he asleep?
Where's the school?
I don't care about politics.
Are you crazy?
I'm very tired.
What do you want me to do?
What did you understand?
Tom has never used the Internet.
When did you start using contact cards?
If I wasn't a thief, I'd buy it.
Sometimes he comes home late.
We were in Boston.
Wait a minute, please.
I can't forget her smile.
I'm going home today.
I've got ice cream.
We've got the best food in town.
I had a hard time.
What do they want?
Anna can't find a job.
This man is not my husband.
Tell them we're busy.
You shot us.
Here's my album.
What fruit is red?
Tom and Mary agreed with us.
He's stronger than me.
Everyone likes money.
Come on, Thomas.
I'm bigger than him.
Tell him why you can't go.
You were right.
Life is like a big car trip.
There's flowers in the refrigerator.
The bus's going home.
Bring Thomas.
Where's the highway?
Tom's paying the bills.
Tom loved Mary very much.
Who ruled the Pedermont?
Who teaches you French?
Tell him not to be late.
Stay in your car.
You're two years younger than me.
Thomas bought something.
Tom will forgive us.
Tom says he saw who got close to Mary's car.
Welcome.
Do you love me?
He hasn't returned to Okinawa.
What did he do with all the money?
Where's Tom playing?
The Committee on Urban Planning accepted our proposal.
You're the only Canadian in our school.
My dog is smaller than yours.
My father died ten years ago.
Tell her why.
You're not thirty.
Because I hate you.
I love Lian.
Tell me why Tom's gone.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Why don't you try talking to the police?
I don't trust this driver.
You win.
Mary was born a boy.
Were you alone?
I'm 25 years old.
Don't get your mask out.
Tom's gone.
Where's my mollusc?
He's dead.
I'm not gonna tell anyone about her.
Tom is learning French.
Tom's a fan.
You're innocent.
I know it was you.
Tom and Mary said they don't have to do it again.
Tom didn't die of cancer.
I don't understand you at all.
The girls are working.
They don't want to talk to you.
We have everything we want.
We have to leave him here.
Where are Mary and Tom?
You missed me.
He said security.
I'm so happy now.
What time did you come back?
Tom tried to kiss Mary.
He kicked me out.
Let's talk.
Tom gave Mary a present.
He read and answered.
Do you know where Holly is?
You should talk to Tom about it.
I don't think it's been three years.
Where did you find the keys?
Some people do terrible things.
You don't listen.
Nobody trusts you.
Give me your names.
What exactly did Tom do?
I'll see you at the hospital.
He's been looking for it in Wikipedia.
I wasn't here last week.
Tom found me.
He's my son.
That student is Tom.
You're smart.
Because I hate you.
I have evidence.
I'm having a bath every second day.
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Who sent it?
I gave him my address.
I'm drunk.
Peter opened the door.
They killed her.
Were you happy?
Tom doesn't like beer.
Tell me how you went to the exams.
I ran home.
Tom shot him.
Ton took care of it.
Do you think Tom will help us?
Eat the soup now that it's hot.
Carlos got stuck in the woods.
Tom stole his ring.
Tom fought with Mary.
I can't promise you anything.
Tell him I'll do it.
Guys, thank you so much for coming here today!
Tell him I'm busy.
He wants to know the truth.
You can't eat here.
It's eight to four.
A little trick in front of the scene is natural before a funeral.
Let's do it!
We've been working as dreamers.
I went outside.
You'll like it.
Now it's up to you.
Tell him I'm busy.
I didn't sleep.
He's been told by the news.
You like snow?
These are Tom's.
When did you decide from Harvard?
You want them?
To forgive others is an act of kindness to yourself.
I'm a failure.
We haven't talked to Tom yet.
We stopped at the store.
I lost my dog.
You have to wait.
We need you here.
Tom said he liked the idea.
Tom just returned from Australia.
You want me to tell her?
This coffee came from fresh water.
Mr. Jackson is teaching us French.
It's very big.
Please give me this book.
You bought a return ticket?
I touched her.
Don't leave me here alone.
You have to listen to me.
I'll wait here at 2:30.
Do you know how to use it?
Ten, two, eight.
I'm happy.
Why are you lying?
There are many words I don't understand.
We have to fix things.
Mary saw Tom get out of the hotel with Concita.
Were you happy?
You have to write a book.
Thomas is Mary's husband.
He's very innocent now.
The bread is fresh.
The animals run.
Tom's moving late.
I think you know who I am.
Your family needs you.
Come on, come on.
The card's white.
Take a giléco.
We both had a lot of fun.
Tom broke it.
We need a map.
Who's missing?
You hit me.
Don't be shy, talk to me.
Are you busy?
What's this?
He's not married.
Bob helped me.
My tongue is complicated.
They're gone.
Stop laughing.
I want to go to school.
Did you cry?
Tom opened the kitchen sink.
Try that sweet from a brothel.
Keep the baso and with both hands.
Tell her I'm busy.
All the planes are dead.
That's a trap.
I guess you're better than Tom.
Don't lie to me!
Tom wasn't at all busy.
We want meat.
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
I'll stay.
She doesn't like this game.
Tom will tell the truth.
Open the box.
Are you home?
I couldn't find my hotel address.
Did you break him?
Don't leave the doors open.
I like honey.
Don't touch the bird's sky.
This is the worst hotel in town.
Keep your eyes closed.
Tom was glad everyone had enough food.
Where's your stuff?
Who did you give it to?
Tell her to come here.
Amelia's staying at Melanie's house.
Would you like to learn French?
Did he come with you?
Tell her I'm sick.
Who are you working for?
You're my friend.
Which one is your book?
It's superfluous.
Did Tom have a gun?
We're no longer friends with Tom.
Tom was happy.
Did you sleep here?
There are islands in the sea.
Who do you want?
What's the basis for this?
Can I?
The price of his coffee fell.
I like that shirt mummy.
To develop properly, these plants need a land that does not contain much moisture.
You want me to tell them?
They believed you.
Tell her you lied.
I made it.
I can't read that.
Can I borrow your earphones?
He's not there.
We have what we deserve.
I like these.
He's hot. I'm gonna go over the air conditioner.
Tom went to the kitchen.
You can sit down if you want.
What's your favorite adventure?
Go ahead and make room for others.
Tell her you don't need him.
I want to try something new.
I haven't seen him since.
They'll get us.
Take it easy!
Give me some time.
Amelia stole my heart.
Do you need ice cream?
Is he speaking English?
Tell them to come home.
Take it with you.
I'd like to see it.
We met him going there.
I have to tell him.
Are they disgusting?
My choice will be the next Saturday, November 29, 2014, at 10:30 p.m.
When did Tom get those shoes?
I don't know where Tom's bags are.
Tell them I'm not gonna do this.
I'm not very good at this.
I was hoping to see Tom.
We're all Canadians here.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.
Tom's gonna cook.
I was scared.
It's preferable to know someone how to fish than to give him a fish.
I was so angry.
I see.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom will listen.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
He's making me laugh.
I'm in a friend's house.
Have you ever slept?
I thought it was a bad dream.
We know what the problem is.
I don't think so.
I'm Mexican, I'm speaking Spanish.
I have a special relationship with my aunt.
I need your help.
Tom wanted to know French.
What are Tom's chances of winning?
Tom doesn't need a lawyer.
Are you speaking Spanish?
You're weak.
Where's the paper?
Go home with your feet.
Tom's gonna cry.
Where's he staying?
When are you coming?
We're ready to help.
Are you ready?
Don't let them come.
It's not accurate.
The fight on the table wasn't more expensive to cut meat, so I used my juice.
Is that your car?
I've got her.
Tom came here last night.
Who asked you?
We moved from Boston to Chicago.
Is this where the bus is standing?
Stop him.
Tom decided to stay until 2:30.
Tell her it's important.
I like to sing.
Tom lost all his money.
What are you gonna tell Tom?
Tom has something to tell you.
How many hours did Tom work yesterday?
Why are we poor?
Tom's cool from the middle and above.
I hope they find Tom.
I'm waiting for you two.
Take them with you.
Give me your money.
What can you say in English?
French is not easy language.
It's not me.
Can you answer?
I have to sit down before the seven.
How many oranges did Tom eat?
"What do you want to know?" "Everything."
Tom kept helping Mary.
Tom will decide October.
Tom will help Mary.
Close the window before you get out.
I wasn't in his shop.
I didn't think it would be so easy for me to do it.
Wait a minute.
Tom's gonna catch Mary.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
I'm your doctor.
Look at that high building.
The city has changed a lot since then.
They're our friends.
Our team has good players.
I always put my group first.
I have a lot of friends living in Boston.
That's not a fish.
Amelia's doing the lessons she's got for the house.
That's what I like about music.
Maria played the role of an elderly lady in the exhibition.
They'll survive.
France's president is Paris.
Tell her to go and worry.
I think I'm in love with Tom.
The bathroom is not too clean.
I'm learning Spanish.
I'd like to help you.
I didn't like it.
The wings are red.
We were both very depressed.
Why did you put in the bag of blood?
Tom and Mary remained good friends.
You speak a language other than English?
Tom's too late.
How often do you eat out?
I'm 19 years old.
When do you have birthdays?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you missed the last bomb?
It's not hard to know English.
The date will be specified later.
Nobody's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a bad thing to do.
I paid for it.
Your friend's here.
I'm thirty years old.
How was the beach?
You're Tom's daughters, right?
Tom had a glass of wine.
I've told you things I've never told anyone else.
Tom took his hands off.
It's very strange.
I like China.
Tom's smoking.
I'll never be as rich as Tom.
You're not a dog.
Do you like white wine?
It'll be tomorrow.
I just said a lot of shit.
The house is broken.
Take the book to the office.
Can I see your birth certificate?
Tom can't tell you anything.
We need him.
Eat meat?
I saw you on TV.
I'm not your teacher.
I'll buy one.
I understand you.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They all went out running out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
He's blind.
Tell them it's important.
The party is the Lord.
We're all Canadians here.
Listen to how he's rocking.
Tom sent you?
Tom's gone.
I've lost my style.
How does this word come to be?
He saved me.
I've got an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't move.
I'm waiting for your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom's got black circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.
They trusted you.
You think this is a game?
I just finished the bathroom.
We're not gonna change anything.
Look what I did!
Tom is Harvard's decision.
You have thirty days.
Tom bought a little gift to Mary.
The Russian language is a Slovenian language spoken as a mother tongue in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and it is widely used, although without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which were the republics of the former Soviet Union.
Tom said they were coming.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm bigger than that.
Why don't you tell them?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How old are you?" "I'm six years old."
Get some water.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
Are you sure you hit the last bomb?
We recognized him.
There's plenty of cheese left.
That's unfair.
In Japan, the new school year begins in April.
You must be very proud of Tom.
How did you guys get in?
Tell her I don't want to go.
I'm not coming back.
Tom's playing his car at least once a week.
The investigation is easy.
This is my grandmother.
What do you usually do?
I have other plans for him.
Are you speaking French?
It's possible.
We're close enough.
Tom took F to the gym.
Did you see who did it?
We're not millions.
Let's thank them.
You'll see the difference.
Don't tell Tom about the party.
I don't know why Tom's not here.
He never forgets his money.
It's almost 20 years old.
You have to stay.
I didn't vote.
Are you angry with Tom?
My parents live a meaningful life in space.
He lost all his money in the casino.
I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good face.
What are you gonna tell Tom?
Thomas found me.
We're very busy.
I can live without water.
We've given your order the highest priority.
We're making a mistake sometimes.
Could I use it?
They killed her.
Oh, my car's boring.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.
We don't know where Tom went.
Who's the chief now?
I'm pregnant.
Can you teach me some French?
I'll show you how it works.
What did you say about us?
These are our children.
Dick worked hard to solve this problem.

Who knows where Tom was born?
Tom didn't tell me anything.
He's got a big neck.
He was poor and couldn't buy it.
It's okay.
Don't worry too much about Tom.
Who sent them?
I'm sorry.
I'm thirty years old.
And the walls have these.
Give me the key.
It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
It'll cost about fifteen dollars.
We all made a mistake.
My best friend is Iceland.
The key is in the office.
You're much smarter than me.
They don't eat anything.
I'll buy one.
She's out of her mind.
I'm surprised.
Who's your teacher?

I don't have anything to open the conserva.
Can I ask you a question?
How's the time there?
I want to catch you.

I'm waiting for you two hours.
You don't care.
I'm kidding.

The game's already over.
Tom has my keys.
He looks happy.
We've been well prepared.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like to put me in bed, don't you?
Is he there?
He's very cute.
They'll listen to us.
I got hurt early.
We'll have to wait.
