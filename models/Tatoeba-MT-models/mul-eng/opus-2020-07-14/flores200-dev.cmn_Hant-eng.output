It's going to fall on the water because of the pressure on the face.
The force of the surface is that the molecules on the surface are strongly attracted to each other and that they are stronger than those on the surface.

And then it's a picture of the atomic light. Of course, the light is much smaller than the picture.
The light is even smaller than the atoms!
