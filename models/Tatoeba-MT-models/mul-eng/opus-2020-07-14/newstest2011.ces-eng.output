What are you doing? ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or sugar
The new main city of ČSSD will have to be translated by a certain language barrier in order to understand their old ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and the representative.
Daník Currently.cz, members of the new board from ČSSD "tested" as they know the notorically introduced slang that occurred on the workshop during the last few years when Prague ruled the most coalition partners.
The codified dictionary, which the Persian politician introduced during the previous era of Prime Minister Paul Béma, describes some of the most famous compositions, situation, and cause in the Metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new concept of work is too complex.
At least they say so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm in Prague's politics as a novelist," he responded to the test of the "Cmotrovian" dictionary working for the culture of Lukáš Kaucký.
And when it comes to political vet, he has responded in a similar way to the work of Karel Bresin.
I mean, maybe it's a golf course.
"It's the only expression you're suggesting to me that I use time."
"I don't usually hear the noise."
From the dictionary, which is now published in June before the popular ODS Congress, he chose six examples, mainly those that are notorically linked to the Prague Master.
Socialists were supposed to explain the notions of "Voldemort", "new golf amphibians in Prague", "go to the sugarcane", "beasts", "the capital city" and "opplechut".
Three of the workers with the flowers agreed, fourth - Antonín Weinert, who has a future head of the Prague school - first brought in the conversation, but later he didn't pick up the phone.
Five working Peter Dolinek refused the same test.
"I'm not going to solve these things at all, and I'm not going to appreciate how the citizens of democracy are doing."
"I'm now going to figure out how we're going to understand our programmes," he replied.
As already noted, Dr. Lukáš Kaucký would not have known in the title above that it was a matter of influence to the businessman and to the friend of the expresstor Béma Romanu Janoušk.
"Voldemort" has nothing to say to Kaucekek, and the only term he correctly chose in the test is "the biggest golf course in Prague".
"It's a White tunnel," says Kaucky, and now he adds, "but I know it better than the news."
"I'm going to have to pay for some language course," he tweets.
The golf course then, as a tunnel Blanca, is perfectly dissipated not only by the matador Karel Brezina, but also useful for the environment of Lukáš Plachi.
Both social Democrats then know who is really Voldemort, and Lukáši Plachém is known and where I will find this - the meaning of "go to the sugar."
"I mean to go to some Prague business," the Plachy near the excuse is that it's about the seat of the Januš firm.
In line with Bresin, he recalls that knowledge was more complicated than a dictionary used.
In social democracy, according to the frequency of the test, there is no similar runaway dictionary of slogans.
"I've been working with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like this."
"We call ourselves more names, often using shorts and confused names," says the Prague President, ČSSD Petr Hullinski, whose guests are surprised by Hilda.
"I've been told by Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues say so," he admits to his own viewer, Karel Brezina.
Deník Currently.cz has tried and works.
Weinert is a friend of Grandpa's or less-friend, representative of Miroslav Poche, who warned himself before the elections of the sponsorship of the party, has in some colleagues the idea of "Play".
The visions are also the only ones that social democracies in the national language.
The Hullian Prij Huldu is not pleased, but the daily Actually.cz has also recorded another overview of this Prague President.
"Doctor of the Obesity Law" immediately recalls that Petr Hulinski received his title JUDr. at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "the witch"
Women reported in Burkina Faso as monsters have several common signs.
More to the older generation, they can't get involved in work, for example for health reasons, they're free and they don't have children.
The one who's "standing" monster is sent to isolation so that she doesn't threaten the rest of the village.
"The husband will only wear a very tight skirt."
"Not even young healthy women, because they help with their work and children," describes a series of sisters who, in the capital of the West African state, Burkina Faso, live in a special house over a hundred women whose communities have grown up in their ranks.
The local government has now decided to intervene against the unusual "social measures".
She picked up an information brochure that should help her to limit her spells.
But he's got a knife.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warned the unfavourable writer Die Standard.
It is also common in other African countries to blame witchcraft.
In Ghana, where Burkina Faso is a neighbor, two decades ago Ammy Hammach died after her three women and two men were tortured, burned with oil and burned.
The BBC server reported the case.
Pachatlers claim that they agreed on an unfortunate finding of circumstances.
For women, according to their version, oil used for ritual healing was poured out.
He just paid for what the group wanted from the women to get out of the evil spirit.
Isolations of the "priests" support people without regard to the level of education they have achieved.
Deník Der Standard quoted a twelve-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The fires of human souls have always represented danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, he is trying to make peace with the government, in Gambia, he has been represented by the president himself in the last year.
"The Gambian President Jammy, after his aunt's death, told a huge hoax who was supposed to share in her death and try to help black magic kill the same president."
"With the help of a joke from nearby Guinea, which, for police, soldiers and personal protection of the president, took the elected men and women from the Gambian neighbors to the presidential farm in Kanila," said Amnesty International in his report.
In the farm, people had to drink a medicine from a hallucinogenic effect that also caused cancer and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Bacal's rental: Topi in the stones, above the rent
The oldest subsidized man drove from the door of the client center of RPG Byty "uhlobaron" Zdenňka Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental apartments in Czech.
Under the guard, he did not send a document and in it a new rent contract to three persons: his daughter and his son, who are in the execution of the sentence.
All three just took the deregulatory to the house.
Instead of 3500 months, the son will be paid for the next year by 2+1 second category 4400 crowns.
"And there's no hot water there, and the toppit must be oiled (dark on the dry fuel, etc.)," a man's finger in his son's new contract, whose signature is full of power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half rejected.
BytyOKD.cz’s civil society, which has marked the new terms as "inaccurate and unfair", recommends that employers not sign and wait until 7 December when public advice on how to deal with it.
But the man just has his hand on it.
"One says it, the other says it," it's dark.
It's a big deregulatory lab.
After the New Year, he is waiting for a large majority of the apartments in the Czech Republic that are still rent-free.
Currently, therefore, it decided to visit "laborator" personally.
The RPG is one of the four in Ostravsk and is already full on Tuesday in the ninth morning.
Right next to the door is the security agency and the device that is in it.
"I've got 2011", the light special button on his touch screen.
A piece of paper with a number out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your figure is already on the big screen under the waiting basket.
You're on the line for half a quarter.
After a while, an older married couple come to the house, but the new ones are obviously not available in the waiting room.
Most people have come to deal with common problems, such as requests for correction, certain events, and so forth.
The letters with new rental contracts are sent to Ostravsk to the postal registers of most of the 44 thousand inhabitants of RPG portfolia gross from half of November.
RPG Byty in letters proposes an increase of 15 to 38 per cent.
A special transfer to new loans was opened at the customer centre on 18 November.
"It runs over a week, so it's just in the run," the workers respond to the delay after the client is represented as a journalist.
The deregulatory and the former Hortic rooms are the local hot topics.
Before the elections, the President of Parliament and the Ostravian cousin Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD was arrested quite quietly, and now local newspapers are filled with him.
"Two years after them, I want a new position."
"They didn't change the desk on my back," said the man mentioned at the outset.
At the most, according to the workers, the taxpayers are coming to convince themselves that they will get a discount from the loan if they sign the time when RPG in the special offer promises them.
Half-time rent discounts will also be received by other tenants who sign the new contract by 15 December.
Javier's "deregulative" break, but the question is definitely not closed.
"There were only about forty-five of the 360 clients here in 2011 due to the rent for the year 2011," the workers suggest.
RPG will propose an individual meeting of the contract where it will be needed on the website and its posts.
However, if both parties disagree, they will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It's not about threats, but about information about only possible and completely legitimate procedure," the RPG warns on its pages.
"There won't be a judge here," one of the RPG Byty's employees thinks and the man on the street before the client centre gives her part of the truth.
"I have 13 thousand breaths and I have five thousand to eat, I don't have to judge," he says.
But the worker's getting back, he'll just find out.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorak tells them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait," he says.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, their economic need is increased.
"The remaining rent still does not meet even more necessary for the free maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Paul Klimès, director of the resident portfolio of RPG Byty's company, that the real estate of the housing fund is the main reason for the increase in loans.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest in the housing of four billion, for four years from 2011 to 2014 it must be 5.2 billion.
A large-scale screen raised in the ceiling against the pulstro-sedacles of the Havrian waiting room is still covering a number of reddished information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less relates to 31 200, which is more than 90% of RPG's."
"And it will always be more than 7,50 Kč per square meter and a month," appears on the screen.
Only in 400 bytes from RPG portfolio will rent up to 38 per cent.
"In these cases an increase from extremely low 19,66 Kč per square metre is indicated," warns the RPG.
The next year, 2600 apartments will remain the same.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulatory will not be able to rent on a scale, but will be distributed up to four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another undertaking: all money from raising the rent (see graph) gives the company back to the apartments, especially in warm support - new windows and heating.
They must be given priority to the people who sign the agreement on an increase in loans.
The office belongs to the school, they understand the architects.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is a new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
No one would expect to hide a mini-colon with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, adjoining furniture, buying toys and even a miniatur garden on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of the employees of Arch.Design can visit her.
The Arch.Design project-architonic company, whose workshops have taken a number of significant fire buildings, has counted with space for its company mini-colon already from the first exhibitions of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people over the age of a baby, and it was her concern that the projectors and architects could get back to work quickly.
As soon as possible, the school is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees under the social program.
Manufacturers and architects have the opportunity to include a special job with child care.
The mini-colon thought of the Arch.Design staff themselves and, with the help of leadership, managed to obtain the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Ministry of Finance is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment and the National Budget of the ČR.
Thanks to the grant funding (appropriate of 2,8 million Kč) the equipment and equipment could be purchased and provided with a qualified staff and service within two years.
After the closure of the financial grant (2 years) the Arch.Design company has the obligation to carry out a mini-colon at its own cost for 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and, with the application for a grant, significantly helped the Economic Rating company.
Péchi ensures a qualified staff, a nurse and an MSP teacher are paid to children all day long, so children can go to school without age limitations, although most of them are 3 years old.
Because it's about "minisculence", there can be only five children at the same time, but it's getting worse during the day.
Schooling is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchy of establishment in the company.
Despite individual training and care, the programme supplement in the mini-school is comparable to the pre-school education framework programme.
Children are not only playing here, but they are assured that they have a quality education - from basic knowledge to preparation for school courses, they also learn English.
The class is equipped not only with toys, sports games, but also with computers that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can always control their children and give up stress with late delivery of children from school away from their parents ’ workplace.
Parents thus use more productive working time.
It's not surprising that there's a natural loyalty relationship between an employee - an employee.
Arch.Design has thus joined the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the collection of new employees, they are friends to the family and through this program they have promoted personal marketing.
The house from the coast is also fascinating for 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudí.
The lake looks like the back of the right liver, the backyard reminds of the dinosaura and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local homes, thanks to his organic design, he served the dream of a house from the bone.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, haircuts and brains, a fascade that reminds of shoes and all-too-fascious haircuts, this is all typical of Antoni Gaudí's set.
The nests of the house play the sound line, the soft colors and textures that mark nature and animals.
A detailed observation is to see geometry, rhythm, and precisely thought order.
During the night, the whole phase of the house is even more dramatic, it's lit up so that it's even cooler.
The feeling of guilt and the crucifixion of the objects with the same size appears in the interiors.
The tree in the valleys copies the branches of the branch, the trunks, the beautiful fronts of the door, the trunk and the leaves.
The house of Batló, located in the fourth Eixample on the Russian shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43, was built in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, wealthy industrialist Joseph Batló, originally insisted on building old buildings and building a whole new one, soon even adopted Gaudí's idea of unusual and lighter construction.
The cynic house of Casa Batló, but Antoni Gaudi didn't build it on his own.
He worked with architect Joseph Maria Jujol.
Right on his projector, the decorations for the representative property owner and the use of the brain at the stage were created.
She also worked at the stage with a number of other artists and artists.
The joint work on the designs of the house of Casa Batló started with the successful collaboration of Jujola with Gaudí.
Jujol divided himself into the building of the house of Gaudí, Casa Milá and the park of Güell, where there are other works of Gaudí.
From the local homes of interest after completion, he served with his organic form of the "House of the Cost".
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the window, began to call it a "dwelling house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of holy Jiří, the patron of Catalánska.
The hidden religious motives also include other sociological elements of the building.
Gaudi proposed at his time a unique system of central heating with the surrounding roads and typical compartments.
The bickering may appear to be a quarter of their five-step shield.
At the time of Gaudi’s creation, he had absolutely no respect for those building regulations and refused to agree with them.
At the start of the construction of the network, the construction permit was received from the city, but the planned reconstruction data were so important that two years later, the city council was broken down and requested the adjustment.
For example, the building was packed with pilots to the public walker.
On the contrary, only fifteen days after the city’s challenge, Joseph Batló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two of the highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower patters.
In the gallery in the second floor there was a social hall and a third floor of the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The property was found to be clandestine.
The entire six-story house is covered with a storage room that can stand up to the same air terrace.
The main features of the reconstruction would be the destruction of all true tasks and direct lines and their replacements with closed walls.
Gaudi also worked with the modern concept of proposed space.
The open-ended opening of the salon doors may offer a full range of opportunities for greater companies to communicate without maintaining the privacy needed for further discussions.
In addition to the new phases, the house with Gaudí’s refurbished was also a non-traditional settlement and two roofs.
It also triggers a Gaudí game with light, blue and white-smoothed glasses that are fitted with inner doors and lamps.
The game has two colors that give the maximum light in all patterns of the house.
It is easy to establish the principle that white light reflects more light than darkness, which the sun’s wings take away.
The house Casa Batló, which was registered in 2005 to the fund of the world’s grandson Unesco, can be visited by everyone.
In the first floor of the house is the most spacious and dignifiedly accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step until 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous face.
They survived because they found out that it was a very good business and, more importantly, they extended their visits to the common and underground areas, including the middle terraces.
It is definitely not necessary, making 16,50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and tourist crews have a 20 per cent discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of entry into other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with the nice candles, you need to chat quickly with one of the residents of the kitchen and visit it directly at home.
How to choose matrices and plants: women have other requirements than men
They've never built a doll, but the quality of the leaves, so matrices and plants, they're giving a really good bed.
It must also be added harmonically to address the specific users.
In the selection, he decides a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health status and ownership.
It is also important that the type of interior to which the matrices and the plants grow.
A typical example?
Maybe on weekend chalupies where they don't regularly meet, they're not suitable latex matrices, because they're less "crazy".
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane matrix.
At the same time, it is necessary to turn it around regularly.
If they don't have a lot of breathing channels in their brain, and still lying on a hard board, they hold a flux: they could even be exposed under them.
In the selection, he also decides the practice.
Those who spend longer time in a foreign country where they often use a lot of high matrices with a fascinating species will find it hard to feel good on the low and hard surface.
"Most of all the hockeys who have returned from NHL are worried that they won't get up here."
"On their broken shoulders, legs and shoulders, the matrices needed a kind of funny line of paint."
"This is also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misappropriate "information" from clubs and dogs," explains Sylva Hadamsky, who specializes in the stolen property.
Many hockeys, but also other customers, so a couple of years ago, the mother-in-law had a dinner dinner.
"Today it's okay, the appropriate matrice needs Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a fighter with NHL to evaluate the line of pay.
This "star" just works.
It optimises its noise and body according to absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing bothers you, you're not going to turn into a heavy trap at night.
Just sleep better.
The line pen also serves as a protection against interlocutions.
When selecting the size of the matrice to your height, add the length of the walk, which is approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of about 180 cm so need bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm double, then 180 cm.
In individual beds, such as singles, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For a comfortable and possible visit.
"There is a rule for a wide bed simple: when lying on the back, you should have your hands gently bent in the back," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, Czech Czech dignitaries and decorators, who have been paying for several years and presents it to professional schools.
In a double box, you need each of your own plants and matrices, but here you are careful about buying to sweeten the height of your matrices.
Otherwise, there will be nothing more to raise growth to different heights, however, it must not be done in any frame of mind.
Iron matrices should have a minimum height of 14 cm, types with a supply layer of at least 15 centimetres, count at least three centimetres on the shape and thickness.
"When it comes to your hand or to your mother's touch, you must definitely not feel it," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each matrix requires a certain type of growth.
The whole bed, when the matrices and the floor are like mature sieves, have nothing to do with the bedrooms.
Mothers are in a bad mood, they can't figure out their ways, which is already common today.
And since we usually spend 0.2 to 0.75 l of the pot per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the matrices start to remember one big (and buried) network.
Therefore, experts reject advertising statements on the life of mothers for up to 25 years or even life assurances.
But everything has its own.
And that's why it's advice from the seller's practice: with a width of 120 or 140 cm hygiene and work not to give a pictureable drawing, but add a better matracian mirror, which you can easily collect and examine.
Although matrices are usually produced throughout the whole process today, so we get two parts (for sleep and the size of the work is very important!), however, manipulation in larger types (and in one person) may be able to remember the light load file in the line with difficulty.
Do you have a hard desk in bed?
Never!
At least on bed for one night's visits.
However, keep the disc (if it has no more) with windscreens and use the matrices with a supply layer and a minimum height of 15 cm with the syringes (with it.Tashchenfederkern) and the cypress type.
Polyurethane matrices on such a basis do not appear.
In non-absorbable lamela plants 14 to 18 lamelas will be suitable latex or sandwich matrices (a combination of latex and coconuts), but you will always pay for the growth with a larger number of lamela, 28 and more where lamelas in the bender area are doubled and their noise can be regulated.
Lammel plants do not look at matrices with a given cross, because they do not respond to needles.
According to the configuration of the lammel, it can also be accessed by such an armchair.
It's about a special cut-off of a needle that allows you to press or even push the needle so that the shoulder is gently "closed".
For men who have "the shoulder across the back", it's definitely important.
It is even remembered by the mackerel producers who in the "Panski" began to use the freezing zone right in the area of the shoulder.
They also remember women - they also touch the soft surfaces in their wheelchairs.
For the most advanced customers, circulatory or destinic growth is determined by such multi-torn measurement.
The pressure is divided into more points and lowers the pressure.
However, when you use the right matrices and the growth of the wrong powder (large and "dungy"), most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the powder has to support the head and tails only apply to the shoulders in order to release the shoulder straps.
The appropriate size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which prefers, for example, Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the powder should be equal (a layer with a branch of a branch tree or a cut into a matrice) to the height of the frame.
Modern matrices have only a few common features with the original strawberries filled with grass.
Their manufacturers continue to use natural materials or at least direct.
The trend was just in the womb.
The raw materials made of polyurethane beet are recovered by natural oils, such as sugar and soybeans.
They're using almost every known producer.
"It was in the womb that the brain was made from the material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of matrices, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can even touch the microcapsule to let you clean the freshness of the forest or the elevators.
There is also division for men and women.
While the man "squares" a plant extract from the chest to absorb heat and cool the body, the woman's "top".
The extract of red peppers increases the circulation of blood, so it's the worst part of the heat.
Today's favorites?
The matrices made from the studied bread (with more pores with a broken bona fide structure, are much more common than the common polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combinations of the different noises of the studied pins and the "lines" pins create a multizone matrix that knows exactly where to be head, bear and patty.
For quality matrices, you will pay from seven thousand crowns and heights.
Those who meet the health parameters have a lower rate of DPH, are protected as health aid.
As the first in the Czech Republic to this benefit of Gumotex.
The fourth on matrices and growth is not easy.
At times it may be necessary to use the shares of manufacturers or sellers who offer two matrices at one price.
Maybe Magniflex is offering Duofreeze matrices with all memory memory in view of 11 990 crowns.
The other one can already be set free.
The iron of the lines or the viscolastic edges with an open rebellion structure and high frequency began with the "cosmic" temperature of Tempur material.
It originally emerged as a material for NASA because at the beginning, astronomers were exposed to enormous pressure.
The temperature in the heat will melt, in the cold it will cool away.
The human body’s heat is so perfect that it adapts and distributes its pressure optimally.
That's why it's perfect against the noise, but it's also to increase the comfort of sleep.
Viscolastic paints are used not only for matrices but also for medical products, should be used for special powders under legs that relax the legs and the liver system.
For example, foreign producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver as well.
People's monitoring devices want the more parents, the more they want their children to be like that.
Fear of owning a child leads more people to the idea of monitoring through GPS.
The system originally designed for the flight of cars can also monitor the movement of people, and this should help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year Anicky Janatk.
The device is still about as big as the cheese box, but soon it can only be as big as the watch.
A lot of people were afraid of the case of missing Anička and began asking for the means to protect their children better.
And for the price of ruining their own.
"We are trying to say to everyone that it is not about any savings, but about another means to reduce the likelihood of some tragedy," says Peter Pilin of the company Macro Weil, which is one of the providers of monitoring facilities on the Czech market.
"I accept that in certain cases it may be possible to use such devices, perhaps if they are given to someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't noticed with such a case yet."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "crab" serves and how it is used in the case of need.
Children’s psychologist Dana Bočk’s cautions that if a child doesn’t want to wear anything like that, he just gets rid of it.
"And very young children show great creativity in how some things are willing to lose if they don't want to be under control."
"The great expectations were originally in the parents of mobile phones, but they can run the same way as this tracking device," Bočková says.
It also argues that if the attack actually did, such a device would help.
"As for a prepared egg, the nurse will always make sure that the child has no electronics that could betray his position."
"Now it's a phone."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will also look for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by mass advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always take a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it is assumed that similar devices can help in the event of a continuous attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čecha of the RC Monitoring company, which offers monitoring services both for cars and for individuals, and in the event of an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, it may be helpful.
"The device may be set to regular removal of the position after a certain period of time."
"If it comes to his injury, at least the last place of the person concerned will be available."
"The more sophisticated devices have built up and cloned, so even if the person just slipped in and remained unmoveable, the device immediately comes out of the warning device with a pitching position," says Czech.
According to him, similar services can also carry smart mobile phones with navigation, where they can also play special software.
The problem of the current tracking units is that it is related to devices similar to those of the size of the syringe or smaller mobile phones.
It's always so terrible to lose them.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, this is why now testing devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This will have the greatest benefit in the fact that the attacker does not have to know the tracking device at all."
"Or he's known for some time and can give the police more time," he adds.
As soon as the tracking devices develop into frames or wires, they will continue to use the same technology as it is used for the monitoring of vehicles.
It is a combination of the location of the GPS (which is used by regular auto navigation) and the functions of the mobile phone that the current position of the vehicle.
The army has a fire-fighting shot to crush the Czechs, but it's only two years old.
The Czech army has dug up 445 miles [445 km] of snow, which melts the markets.
A month later, the Ministry of Defence added a 224 - mile [224 km] shadow to it.
The military's got supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the duration of the shadow is two, maximum four years.
The army bought a fire-fighting shots from the stock market STV Group, a.k.a. 40 million crowns.
The general government in charge of the purchase of such a large quantity of frozen MF DNAs has described that soldiers in training consume 60 kilometres of fuel each year.
However, it appears from the proposals of the military pyrotechnics described by the MF DNES, that then a very intensive pyrotechnic training should be conducted every year by all generals, officers of military command, secretaries or officers.
Minister of Defence Alexandra Vondru and the commander of the army of Vlastimil Picka is not recognized.
It would only be possible to justify the annual consumption of weapons of 60 kilometres of fuel.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand pounds.
And even if that were true, the arms stocks would last for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, the basic training of each new professional would be more than two meters of fun fun, as experts say, the army would ensure - and with increased demand for women or special units - resources for the 225 years mentioned.
The Brigadiers of quick detection have recently personally complained that they do not have nearly any weapons of arms, so they are also shooting because of the need for money.
He's not talking about the lack of the underpants.
"And my head doesn't care that they buy so much tobacco from us again."
"But that's their decision, and they know what's going to happen to them."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as traders try to answer," says business manager STV Group Jan Décky.
The Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek argues that hundreds of miles of stolen shells and that the army will have the resources of this "munice" for at least ten years.
Jan Thank you from the STV Group, however, speaks only about the four-year life of fire and police or military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"In the perfect storage they can be, too, the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier because of the crisis of the army, does not want to publish a name.
After a lifetime, each municipality must be thoroughly tested whether it is still active and does not threaten soldiers in life.
But these tests aren't free and they're worth more money.
Another argument of the ministry is a multi-scaling peak of 445 kilometres of cloudy snow.
"We have been in possession of about sixteen per cent less than the low supply of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," Pješek, a spokesman for the purchase ministry, comments.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of fire extinguishers of police pyrotechnics that liquidate ammunition from the second world war or from the Soviet army is no longer more than 1,500 metres.
And the police always only order such a lot to consume these coins even before life expires.
It proved to her that because of the safety of pyrotechnics, it can get more and more modern and even more common types of shadow.
The Ministry of Defence has already had significant difficulties with liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition since the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two-hundred-and-a-half-a-half-year Czech Slovak army was preparing for arrest in Rhine.
Here, according to the Czech pyrotechnics MF DNES, is waiting for a couple of years to deal with this problem: it will liquidate hundreds of miles of old trailers, which today buys "lacino".
Now, I'm getting off the contacts I've got with the competition.
The winning place in the competition for the Year of Life helped Lukáši Pytloun to sell his hotel French.
During the victory of last year's competition for the Year, the eight-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberce became a businessman.
His story of success is like a movie.
You like Pytloun's trip.
And in fact, he realized that in Liberci there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
With the support of foreign brigades and with the help of the bank loan, he bought a rented house with five rooms.
The fact that he was still a third-year-old high school student was a big distraction.
"The toughest difference between the quality and the price of living in us has not been left to me to do anything about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first rebuilt apartment started to be hired by foreign workers.
All the profits were invested back into the house, which was gradually transferred to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberci.
The most comfortable of these were the modern four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, came another, as well as quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in the island of Tisse, where we have sold our French concept and other interests about the French hotel Pytloun are voting," says the Polish daily number one.
"And on this sale of the hotel's licence to carry out the hotel, the right victory was shared in the competition for the Year of Life," said Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberci and around.
"People knew me on the streets, they were more and more gratuitous to me, and I have to say that it was nice," she recalls.
Participation in competition strongly recommends to all who are trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to celebrate. Every visit is good.
He says you're getting a bunch of contacts and notes that he might not even get.
"Some of the people I met with, thanks to the competition, I started trading regularly."
The glory associated with success according to him came so little to every employee.
And that he's got about seventy.
"I warn them that they are more loyal and proud to share in something that has gained general recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of good work for all of us."
"It's my name that's thrown to the front," says Luke Pytloun.
It's a quieter year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory quickly had the consequences of the crisis.
But thanks to the goal of victory, Farmet has more time for himself.
For the first place in the last anniversary of the Vodafone Company’s competition, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel Zžárský, came to the house in Slovenia last year.
At that time, he assessed the efforts he had made by means of a small tool industry in the Czech Skalica company with the promotional work.
"I can say that the evaluation raised not only me, but all my employees and increased our awareness of the competition agreement," said the London winner today.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet's company, it was a pleasure to do something useful.
And so when the state offered the father of Karl Žžárské to rent a small workshop as compensation for Communists' property, he was long gone, refused a career at a firm where he was working, and with some friends around his dad, he put the company on a plastic van.
Soon thereafter, they began to specialize in the leaves of plant oil.
After 18 years, they became the largest producer of automatic lismos in Central Europe.
More knowledge and, among the independent public, was obtained after success in competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to take the brand Farmet much better, but foreign partners also began to evaluate their cooperation with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Zžárski.
The full year, however, was not in the Farmet only in the symbol of the euphoria of victory.
The evaluation came from the economic results of the company by 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of the machine product.
A crisis that still has not touched the citizens, but companies have already set up their investment projects and have started to limit the purchases of new machines and technologies.
"Of course, this situation didn't surprise us."
"The markets had dropped by 40 percent, we had to limit the production and came to release," explains Karel Ząarski.
A life-threatening company must sometimes be able to take such non-popular measures.
But the situation was ruled, and the company was in profit, even though I was less than before the crisis.
However, what they did not find in the Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We have developed research and school environments, strengthened presentations at international fairs, received the main evaluations at home exhibitions," says Zžjarski.
They all testify that the crisis is behind them.
Markets are growing again and with them and the number of new employees.
"The new victory is a pleasant feeling from victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Züyarski.
An attempt to remove unreasonable rules
The survey on Absurdita year is a fourth part of the business clinic.
Some unreasonable rules have already been deleted.
The unfavourable winner of another Absurdita Annual Survey has become obliged to carry on to the Office documents that are also available online to officials.
It has decided more than a third of the less than four thousand votes.
For example, social security management required a paper extract from the trade register, although its official can obtain two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the poll, it's gonna change.
"The Czech Social Security Board has already issued a statement from the trade register on the controls in the payments will not be required," said ČSSZ Jana Buranjová.
Congratulations on all the regulations and regulations that companies and businessmen in Czech have to meet, and you are not going to break the meaning of Absurdita's competition this year.
This year is already the fourth part of the business chain of organised economic news and there is still a growing trend among the public.
If about three thousand voters participated in the vote, the vote would have been four thousand this year.
And it's not strange, the most diverse legal obligations that serve only to maintain business, we still have enough and enough.
"We must be in the number of leisters for recognition of taxes in the world," Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Farmers of the Czech Republic notes.
Simplification of businesses has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving in particular.
According to the World Bank, in view of the conditions for business, Czech Republic has placed at position 74, which is eight places higher than the moon.
The contester Absurdita was first announced in 2006 and is held each year according to the same scenario.
The administrative and bureaucratic reasons may be reported every year from the depth to the end of the summit when the conclusion of the competition is final.
The website is available at www.ffaroku.cz After the competition editor selects seven candidates for "anticen" and allows them to vote regularly over the Internet at www.ffaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Absurdita, who will get the most votes won.
More than one percentage, more than 105 regulations and regulations were notified to the annual survey.
The guys sent businessmen, but also professional salesmen and journalists.
Among the "fine" competitions, for example, the requirement for vehicles to be paid for the maintenance of the distance and speed lines, or for business with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the annual week of proposals is published on the competition pages.
The declaration of competition, which is always at the beginning of November at the Václavs village in Prague, is part of the hacking, which regularly participates in political and social life.
For example, in this year's campaign, Eva Freedov, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Livers of the Czech Republic or Peter Kužel, President of the Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic, participated.
"The economic prosperity cannot function where the business is threatened by the cracks under the legs, so my goal is to break down at least three dozen paragraphs, which today are just too complex," industry and trade minister Martin Kocourek said.
The effort to break the unreasonable regulation does not appear immediately.
In 2007, people were obliged to report three days before the health authority in a place where there is a permanent place of service, to take a stand at the exhibition or research.
This obligation was removed by the new social law.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was announced by the Office of Employment for its foreign employee within 30 days, was removed by the law on the so-called green card.
And to the third of all good.
In 2009 the regulation of physiotherapy was to have a large visual, refrigerator and two flexible weights.
This has been addressed in the annual health statement of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator disappears.
The new category assesses corporate liability companies
Values are ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
In the fifth anniversary of the competition for economic news, the newspaper is a category called the Responsible Company in 2010.
I am sending this competition to support intelligent and fair business.
"We would like to support companies that take into account the effects of their business on the environment and support community-based activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, the company of Vodafone, who is a complainant and a competitor in the event of a war of the year.
In the first year of the year, this special sub-category of the main competition of the Vadafone Company in 2010 was reported by companies that did not achieve the sole long-term objective.
Each experience is very inspiring and will be published on a separate article.
Although the object of its activities is one of the other diametrically similar, support and transparency may be considered to be common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities and others need personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, among all four full-public finalists, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of non-formal sports teams among employees who are then participating in various sports tournaments.
Another example is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the trust fund for the sponsoring of children with disabilities for seven years.
A paper from Podrebrad, which has more than 70 per cent of its health-care staff, is also available for the title of the Central Bank’s responsible companies and was placed in the company’s third country in the competition with the Vadaphone Company for the year.
At Olomouk, the accountant MiRyz Soft, who introduced a given working time, was further reduced to 35 hours a week, but not significantly reduced wages.
The title of the jury also made it possible to buy from Czech producers primarily, support civil activities in the immediate environment, and provide four environmental environments.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and our administrations have at least an impact on the environment," explains unit Milusz Rynzar.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from Austria again thinks about the health of its employees and has arranged ergonomics and keyboards for each notebook, supporting their work from home and using catering services provided by local protected workers on their business activities.
"In addition, we support the dedication of a person in the darkness, which helps the local Roma community specifically," says the representative of Ondréj Suchi.
At the latest, they are also in favour of the activities of the company Praní and cleaning from the Karlovarsk Country, which contributes to their pension insurance by their employees in the form of standard bonuses.
"We are also contributing to fear, transport, increased qualifications and recreation," said Josef Strapč of the Czasch Bruntal Building Company, victory in the Moravskoslezsk country.
All countries of the finalist competition of the Vodafone Company of the year have been automatically notified to the category of responsible company, who have answered the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the applicant and sent it by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the editor.
"If the representatives of the competition firm did not answer the questions, the competitions could not participate in the company responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the "main" competition of the Vodafone Company of the year."
"Only a self-reporting is not possible for this competition, because it is a subcategories of the company's main competition for the year," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose's executive agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzni, the police arrested in public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzni, the anti-corruption police were arrested in the past days.
The detectives set up a local businessman in the media and dealers with the realities of Luboši G.
He has tried to manipulate the real-time public competition in order to obtain a specific interest from the country offered in the competition.
He was supposed to pay half a million dollars for it.
"I can only confirm at the moment that the police are bringing one person to war through public bans and public competition," said the Chief Justice of the Plenary State Representative, Antonie Greena, with the fact that further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Sixty-three-year-old police officers were released after 24 hours.
The extent to which the public competition could have an impact can only be reflected in the minimum official information.
The talk by the Land Fund of Lubomíra Black on the question of the Law indicated that the police were actually involved in a decided workshop in Plzni, which was during public competition.
"It was about a client, not our employee," she pointed out.
The public competition is entitled "Requires for the award of land transfer grants under land law" and runs where more eligible applicants are concerned about the land offered.
"These persons in the context of the challenge offer a higher value of their refund payments to be carried out before the land value has been declared."
"On the basis of the claims offered, there will be a series of beneficiaries and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest rates," explained the speaking fund.
Love G. evidently had information about who responded to the call, and because he was also a right-minded person, because he bought a number of refund payments, he offered an interested party that he was not participating in the competition.
Well, that's exactly what he meant.
This would explain that he had such a huge sum of money in custody.
Love G. had over standard contacts on PF in Plzny in the past.
He described in the case of former chief PF Václava Sankota, who was convicted of being released in the restoration of land for which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
At that time, Luboš G. received from the Fund, for example, land designated for the construction of public communications, in particular in a place where an entrance magistrates were to be established in the Borská area of the industrial area.
Later, he made a very good change with the master behind the house in the city’s own historic center, which had a much higher value.
At that time, she had to join the factory because otherwise, the blockade would threaten the building.
Housing housing allowance per month
Homes will have to be paid from winter to summer not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and storage, heat supplies and some plants and rentals.
The family will have to get out of the money from the cold to the hundreds of corn months more than now.
The electricity costs up to 4.6 percent, the electricity will be about 2 percent more expensive, and in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and in many places also support the supply of central heating.
The electricity consumption should be housed in the houses annually for the stock market as far as now.
The price of power electricity has been reduced by all main suppliers, so there is a significant increase in support for energy production from renewable sources, especially photovoltaic.
The river flows gently, even when people are the most hot and have the highest consumption.
Each year, therefore, it must also be counted by hundreds more.
While electricity and electricity are sold throughout the Republic, the price change of central printing is better than the place.
Price increases are mainly planned for larger cities.
For example, the house in Pardubiči or the City of the King pays from January for central printing of about 50 kroner per month, more than 1000 krun per year for families in Liberci.
The people of Prague are also at risk that more than 9 per cent of them have water and waste, and that the city is increasing rent from infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, he's gonna pay 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague, however, will remain below the comparison of the total population.
On the north of Čech, where the prices are now between the highest, it has a water and sandy surface of 7.4 per cent.
For example, the price growth of renting in 450 thousand rental apartments, where the regulation ends in winter, can be very high.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which in Austria over Labe owns about 2,500 apartments, is able to increase from cold rent to 100%.
Those who won't agree with the new rent are willing to give company to the court.
The regulated loans paid by people in about 300 thousand homes could grow to 10 percent next year.
The Czech children are drunk by the fernet and noise. The beer is from the fashion, it's getting a little less.
Fernet, rum, vodka, excellent and better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that end up with the most frequent treatment of smokers who haven't been in their hands for fifteen years.
The exception is not children who are treated from opioids in the hospital repeatedly.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who meet with similar cases at the adoption of a child health department.
"Some beer or wine are completely unspoiled, because it lasts a long time before you drink them."
"Trendem is certainly a strong alcohol," he sent to the Children's Hospital in the Central Czech People's Republic of Pelikán.
"When they are able to pull the father's lavender out of the net, it needs whiskey, but otherwise the fernet and the vodka will take over."
"The vodka has the advantage that they put it into the hole and it's not so much to feel," explained the receptionist.
And for the truth, he's also being given the School Hospital of Motol Eva Jurin.
"The most common thing is fernet or room."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially at basic schools."
"In some cases it was about a sleigh that they brought out of the house," pointed Jurinov.
According to Pelican, there are 13 or fourteen drinks on the hospital’s hospital entrance relatively common beer.
Before the Horovices, where he has been working since the year, he worked for ten years right at the Paediatrics in Motole, where the saunas enjoy the abandoned schools from a wide area.
"A girl lay with us about four times."
"The career started in twelve years when it was brought to us with 3.5 alcohol in blood in addition to in combination with ecstasy," the doctor wrote in particular a serious case.
"She was at a show in the Holeszowices on some dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't come at all especially that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," he shared.
It is not just the parents ’ interest or even their significant tolerance for drinking their own offspring is considered to be the main cause of growing children’s drinking.
However, according to experts in children, it is not possible to speak about independence in the right sense.
"I mean, alcohol is understood to be a several-year chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena that belong to it, and it's not in children."
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is a rather significant family-social background," explained the receptionist Pelikán.
According to a speech by Jurin, at the Paediatric Clinic in Motole, they hospitaled up to half of the adult population in November.
However, only those with severe intoxification who had to remain in the hospital will be provided with statistics.
The children who carry their parents after an ambulance treatment, if any, are at home with the police, are never counted.
In addition to the cases where children sit only after school and drink the rest of their hair, there are three seasonal exercises that can be dealt with: the Virgin Mary, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
"It either sings regret from the wrong statement or celebrates the beginning of the holiday."
"I've lived on the convent at the entrance and seven children's shelters together," Pelikán subsisted.
The opilec who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is in the favor of the one who spends his day at home with an unacceptable cocaine.
Early headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are also associated with induction infusions with glucose and animals that fail the body.
"They're really better on it, because they have a great evening experience and good excitement and nothing hurts."
"They are only suspicious of where they are," Pelikán agreed with the fact that sometimes it causes patients to suffer from at least the cost of their treatment.
The transfer of the sanitka and hospitalization to the acute leukemia is also going to be made up of tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used it as an excuse when I counted on the children immediately and then calculated how many of their funerals remained and that they could also spend the entire summer on the Brigade to make themselves available for this one evening," Pelikán added.
However, according to the Regressive Management Board, in which the costs of treatment should be eliminated after parents are removed, in the case of child abusers do not apply.
Two L-159 planes are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 flights from all five vessels, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the transport flight Casa C-295M, in the afternoon to the Spanish Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is seated.
It's the first thing this type of machine has appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
In the winter, they were only for vacations or pre-primary years.
This is a bidirectional version L-159T1, which has already been carried out by the Czech army and which have been flying.
The remaining three machines are L-159 units.
These are currently held in Aero Vodochody and the trade intermediary - Omnipol - has already taken over last week.
When the plane is physically rectified from Vodohod, it's not according to Jan Pejška of the press committee we're already known.
"The individual L-159 flights for the change were excluded from the long-term flights imposed, without any additional revenue and investment from the Ministry's resort."
"Two-sided L-159T1s have been changed in the current state and the same," said Law Pejšek.
He added that the army would not be left without bilateral flights because in May 2009, the Ministry signed with Aerem Vodochody a contract of 200 million kroner for the conversion of four L-159 non-required machines into two dual-use machines.
One new plane took over the army in July, the other we'll take to the end of the year.
According to Pejška, the EADS claimed that the aircraft is engaged in the army of some alien countries.
"You are clearly indicated in the contract that the L-159 air carrier is an EADS company and will serve as a pilot from NATO."
"That's why there's a pick-up thing that's how this thing will be realized," Pejšek said.
In the past, economic newspapers have pointed out, for example, that the Spanish army of L-159 is not interested.
The exchange of five L-159 for one flight to Casa and the purchase of another three flights to 3.5 billion kroner has been approved by the government of Mirka Topolánka.
The Ministry of Defence did not refer to the purchase of the electoral order and made a statement directly to EADS.
The subsequent defence leader argued that the amendment supported future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and used only 24, the rest of which she wanted to sell.
The purchase of Casa's plane will probably have a court hearing.
The European Commission also appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice because the aircraft had to be selected on the basis of a European trend and never a single producer.
The army has already taken over the three-year-old Casa, the last of which should be flying to the Prussian airport of Kbely within fourteen days.
A different indicator than a ring means a lower risk of cancer
Men who have an indicator greater than a ring are exposed to less risk of developing cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion of the study published in the middle by the British magazine cancer.
It can relate to the cold male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of risk of prostate cancer, especially for men up to 60 years," said a co-author of Ros Eeles, professor of cancer research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should submit to the cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other risk factors such as family health stress, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, there were more than 1500 cancer patients in Britain and more than three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the students had a sign on their right hands than a ring.
It paid for them the same probability of prostitution as 19 per cent of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of those who had an indicator greater than a ring, however, the risk was 33 per cent, a decrease of up to 87 per cent for men.
The length of two mentioned fingers - created in the prenatal period - is clearly reflecting the different levels of sexual hormones that the child is exposed to in the brain.
Less testosterone corresponds to a further indicator.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone directly supports growing prostate cancer.
The former Czech genetics and former President of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes for ČTK said that he knew about this study, but he does not think that the relationship between long fingers and cancer would be "completely demonstrated".
Czechs are under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and on the roads, most of the snowy snows, railways in many places traveled all night.
It is closed in the morning between 89 and 93 km from the road to Rozwadov because of a number of lack of cost and personal cars and is also D1 in Brna in the direction of Prague.
The newspaper said it was the Central Autobot Club (UAMK).
At 91 miles [91 km], the truck was parked, two expensive cars were hit, no accident required injury.
A number of personal cars were also completed.
The problems are also at D1 distance to 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks broke in there.
The drivers should sit quietly behind Brne at 190 kilometers or go across Brno and then spend 182 kilometers on Kyvalce.
There's a couple of kilometer columns.
There's also an accident on the D11 street, and it's coming to Prague right now.
In Prague there are several centimetre snow types, temperatures indicate less than seven degrees Celsius.
Cars, for example, are built on Prosek, which is also built in Štérboholska.
The safest means of transport is a metro.
Tramvaj runs late, for example, on the road between Karl's place and the town of Mira.
At 8:00 a.m., he's gonna have to sit down again at the Prussian crisis scene again.
The railways and airports are also facing problems.
The Czech dragons had already had to break down seven fast connections for the snow.
The problems, for example, have gone from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
The Russian airport was closed from 11 o'clock in the middle of the night to 5 o'clock in the morning.
Most of the roads in south Moravia are already dry, but only with increased caution.
In Switzerland, there are three additional railways, in Brnäńsk, the places of the formation of the language of the snow and in Blanescu are necessary to achieve some communication in the above-mentioned snow resorts.
To the most reached, Switzerland belonged.
There are now closed roads: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatice - Miljesovie.
They're gonna have to put the brakes on.
When they're released, they can't go back yet.
There is a need for caution in the region of the White Carpaths.
The ČTK has been introduced on the roads, which are kept only by inert dust due to the protection of nature.
In Czech, it fell from two to ten inches [2 to 10 cm] of snow, most of it fell in northern Czechs, sometimes up to 18 inches [18 cm].
In the Moravskoslez region, about 15 inches [15 cm] of snow fell.
The snow in the Czech Republic is slowly rising.
American soldiers have a new "fast weapon"
The U.S. Army has set up a new "swift" weapon in Afghanistan, now known only under code XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic gun will affect the dark conflict with the Taliban and the "change of game" in their prosperity.
The new weapon is something like a little super-pretty piece.
Its design suggests a laser with precision for several meters.
Special loads of 25 mm raw, produced for this gun and containing high fuel, actually work as small granite.
Threats can be programmed so that they'll explode not only in an attempt to reach the goal, but in any case they'll have their ballistic love.
So you can use them against enemies who hide behind a barrier, behind a wall, or in a shelter.
The sword is not usually protected, and when the deadly rain of the ossuaries falls on it, it can turn it out of battle.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of the XM-25, a new gun is the first weapon to win, which is used by "light" technology.
"The bird with it is basically going to find a target, a laser paper that determines the distance, so it gets a clear point of purpose, according to which it corrects the design and cuts the angle."
"Let's say you've planned 543 meters."
"If you press the bag, the gun will strike and fire the arrow at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be transferred
Group Fujitsu is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will be transferred to their workplace in June of the next year from the available administrative building at the Marienbader-municipation in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As in the middle, a giant in the area specializing in computers and their maintenance was transferred to the next year by 400 men and women from their place of work from the available administrative building at the Marienbader-nämt in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in the Lyons Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the Finnish language, there should be another 100 other jobs in the group that are already divided into the region, at the appropriate time.
The offer of rent was mainly attractive and large-scale offices in Astro Park were more responsive to the employee's working method.
Fujitsu was also in Bad Homburg only at the rent.
Captain Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central seat with excellent infrastructure."
The exclusive connection with the airport is just as important for the global company as Fujitsu.
The recent movement of an important undertaking in the region brought joy to the winners and to the disappointment of the wounded.
The leading economic rapporteur in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said it was possible to obtain a "global player".
It's just a fantastic expression of trust in this place.
Fujitsu is heading to the city, breakfast is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Old Bad Homburg, Michael Korwiss (Green), has regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was first informed by the management of its purpose.
"Of course we offered our help," said Korvis.
Friendly contacts, however, did not change the difficulty of computer manufacturers with the owner of the property at the Marienbader station.
As a result, there were reasonable economic reasons.
Now one thing is to avoid a long absence in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and the owner of the building are cooperative."
The house at the Rathaus Museum, which has recently been used by Fujitsu, and its neighbors, the Kleine Verticale, belonged to the other buildings in the Marienbader town for the most discussed construction purposes of the city.
Between the airport and the factory, it became a joint project of the city and a private projector such as the city entrance, which was criticized for the massive construction of the area that previously served as a parking lot and also for the high buildings.
In 2001 a company of investment advice and rating Feri, a software manufacturer for road distribution systems, Start Amadeus, moved to the house, as well as a manufacturer of Fujitsu computers, who was still connected to Siemens company.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 together with Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and were sold in Madrid by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA.
Fujitsu group from Tokyo is identified as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computers and servers available and provides necessary services.
The district in the Rīna and Mohan region is one of the largest in Germany, but most of the employees of Fujitsu are in Munich.
Bad Homburg is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, another subsidiary in this site will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building, Astro Park was located for this purpose 7,000 square metres.
In the complex - its name is highlighted by the star plant, which is 20 years old, sitting in addition to other central chains of the electronic and electronic industry.
Amazon kicks the server - attacks against Assangem
Wikileaks gets into trouble.
The Amazon Internet Service launched a platform for advertising on its servers.
It may be that this has happened to a political pressure after the statistics of secret diplomatic missions have been published.
Founder Wikileaks Assange is officially held in Great Britain.
Wikileaks, the advertising platform, is getting in the United States under increasing pressure.
Internet activists have lost access to their available home server in America and are now looking for internet homes in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and businesses to fight Wikileaks.
And the Founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is on the list of Interpols sought, should be held in accordance with a press contribution to the Great Britain.
"Wickleaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in the free country," they announced active announcements of the service of short news on Twitter in the middle (local time).
A short time ago, Amazon's online company came up with Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used to publish secret diplomatic coverage Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to manage a high number of access to documents.
With the help of Twitter, Wikileaks explained this step: "Well - our dollars will now be lost because we employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, they should stop selling books.
The Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's former staff took over, published CNN television station based on information from Lieberman's office.
The President of the Senate Committee for the Defence of the House of Amazon threatened the fight, informing the British Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to join this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman, among other things, called for a ban on the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks is one illegal, unbelievably, and therefore our national security poses a threat and endangers life on the whole of the planet," said one non-Secretian senator's statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
Founder Wikileaks Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list of found Interpol.
According to a report in London's "The Independent" newspaper, the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard is known for its exact location.
Internet activists have always marked an investigation in Sweden for the intrepidness of their opponents.
Speaking of Wikileaks Kristinn Hraffsson in London, he said there was an explosion.
"Doconces were challenges to Julian Assange's murder."
That's why Assange is afraid of his safety, said Hraffsson.
That's why the Wikileaks depositor will keep hiding.
Hraffsson was obviously responding to North America's products.
In the United States, former Republican Governor Arkansasu, Mike Huckabee, requested that the person responsible for publishing Wikileaks be charged and corrected for fraud.
In Canada, a leader of the government, Stephen Harper, said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use a "target flight".
Meanwhile, she was discussed between the White House and the Assange speech shooting.
American President Baracka Obamy, Robert Gibbs, called it "a funny and absurd" that Assange asked for a representative of the foreign ministry of Hillary Clinton, if he was responsible for the recent published Spanish challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of a person with web pages," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now investigating the safety of its databases.
The Special Commissioner was appointed representative of the Centre for Anti-Terrorist Action, Russell Travers, to the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of the "needed refurbishment in the structure", which is necessary after the release of the message from the release to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine how the whole government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it would like to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they were to get into danger because of the release on Wikileaks.
"We have made everything available to get in touch with them," said Foreign Minister Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them, though it would be necessary."
Winter University
"Gelato University" in Bolon is preparing frozen sugars for a better annual period.
The basic course for a future winterer, which lasts three days, is a great deal of interest and visitors come from around the world.
Where's the ice cream?
From Gelatier and Gelatai.
Gelatiere, a little old-fashioned Czech ice cream, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio delivers a frozen butter from the cold box, puts it into the dishes and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream, he's not gonna get rid of the Galato-University of Italian Carpigian companies.
In 2003, the manufacturer of frozen machinery at the University of Winters was set up to meet the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatier, which lasts for three days, is an enormous interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, several special courses are also offered on chocolate butter and practice in their own refrigerator.
Someone complains in his Midlife-Crisis after a new career, others look at the heavy ice of their inexplicable waves.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all worlds - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the move of Slow-Food and wants to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Even in Berlin, she was a business consultant and wanted to start her own business after years of hard work.
Two young Egyptians dream that they'll open a frozen oven in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil wanted to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman at Julia's home, because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
Unsatisfying is not only good taste, but also a delicious taste and good consistency.
Luciano is not forgotten during his school in the south and its own kitchen: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a need for a romantic dose."
The first step of production seems to be all simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, milk, milk powder, sugar and stabilisation into a large mix, which all plays an electronic program at 85 degrees and then runs at four degrees.
Then he turns on the kitchen machine and removes a pasteurized white basic cream, based on all kinds of milk creams.
At the same time, the teacher is asked questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano warns, to let himself be led by a spirit of ignorance.
Who speaks of cold "only from natural passions", apparently using stabilisers - most natural product, like a guarantor's mouth from guarantor mirrors.
Of course it is possible to make ice cream and without stabilisers, but it has to be sold for one day or another, and the customer has to take off the ice itself.
Certain variations of basic weights are allowed.
It's gonna be more intense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano separates in the taste of ice cream according to the tastes that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit and in the sweetness department.
In addition, there are insects and worms.
"Your contributors will try to introduce a lot of aromatized vows."
"But you should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and pure fruit.
Or frozen from the white background weight that changes the eggs on the yellow cream and the egg on the basis of the various chocolate test.
Now he's able to take a course in freezing machines.
Luciano is always allowed to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and liqueur butter - whether or not with eggs or without them in a basic quantity, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is being carried out with fruity kinds of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruity pyre - given the taste it's not always better.
Liskoorice butter must not taste more oscillating if it contains more oscilloscopes.
The most popular ice cream made by the group, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabiliser.
The first time the exported mixture is excited by the taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of frozen milk is a purely starting task: If a lot of sugar be used, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
There is a need for extra portions of sugar in the citric acid.
Luciano produces a device that determines the contents of the sugar in the egg (the veins are measured by the muscle from the roots).
The luck tables make the numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much as it used to be.
It does not only help the automatic production of basic weight.
There is also a device which, at the same time, produces a pre-mixture of the frozen mixture into the cream and maintains at least the temperature.
And over all the automation, we're not going to get away with the small discrepancies.
Brasilan Gustavo will save himself and his colleagues by the bottom of a fruit pyre when he is removed from the control of the size mixer.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time when something like this happens."
Monitors won't give you Vitamin D — but sunlight will...
The European Food Authority for Efsa is engaged in an industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This charge is now referred to by a group of Testbiotists experts, which is considered to be an independent institution to address the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a splice theory, but we have well documented it," said in the middle of Munich's Chief Testbiotech Christoph Thenn.
The leading group of Efsa experts for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa professionals have been engaged in a contract with their own Ilsi pilots for several years.
This is a financial case like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has participated in the crucial way in controlling the Efsa genetic plants regulations and is so clearly interested, he criticizes Then.
The rules of the Efsa are fully in line with the full paragraphs of the Ilsi documents and are not so a copy of the industry that should be controlled by the Italian Parliament.
It's already a matter of what Testbiots warn of on the scene of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efsa, with no supplements or transitional periods, passed to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and then changed the parties.
In addition, the Central German (MDR) resolution has recently removed the EU's staffing agency to control industrial lobby, which has raised the interest of both the Ministry of Environment and the EU's Members.
In the meantime, Efsa can't recognize the threat of interest.
It works with all the serial data, so also with the industry, if they are highly skilled, is indicated in one statement.
The experts working for Ephesus are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But he's got to fix it.
Cooper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is only marked as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - except for the risk of biotechnology without lobbying contracts.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that at the present time genetically modified plants in animals have not been tested and that genetic plants do not react to the effects of the environment.
"We want to know what he's doing, for example, genetically modified corn on the ground," says Thenn.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins rather than the whole genetic growth, which does not result in side effects.
"If they don't look for the risk, how could they be found then?" he asks sadly, then.
At the same time, Angelika Hilbeck agreed.
The scientific laboratory has studied genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical High School in Curry.
In this area, industry is trying the same as in the United States, and now in Europe, it is still more influential or discredited by critical scientists.
That's why there's hardly any scientists who wouldn't be involved with the group anymore.
Most of them do not publish studies that are critical to society.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
Stone stage
Uli Gsell also ordered some, about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of a tower in Stuttgart, a dormitory on the back.
She was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
The experience is: In September the bars came and started shooting a large corner of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar climate reduction.
When the building was stopped, most of the crests were in the pockets.
It's split into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
A warrior with Crailsheim, a soft rough stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a Saturday in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He's got a few of these shirts.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't disappear."
It says, "The left and the left stone, the simple and the right."
When one of them broke up, he died after a cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what to do with those shirts yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
A stone stop from Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tübingen at the former French Army Museum, where Manuel Rongen built his stone mine.
A 44-year-old man is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who came out during the strike in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were planted on a stake or lost on a deposition," says in his office, a wooden building that was formerly a housekeeper.
He claims he was betrayed and threatened when, in the shadow of all the news, he bought the rest of the northern wing from a company that carries out demolitions.
But he talked to S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that the demons can't do it.
And when that's happening, it's still the smartest when stones continue to use it.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, priced at a cost of between €6.50 and €14.
As a reminder, some also hope to bring him back to the rebuilt building.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cost 25 large expensive cars.
About half is still in the forest, the rest of it has been sold for a long time.
Farmers, national gardeners, housekeepers.
They came from all the kitchens and took what came into the kitchen and the trailer.
The stones of the story of Stuttgart have long changed into "darks" or as the rest of the scenes.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political intervention."
He's sitting in his field car and going on a walk after his 20th hectar kingdom.
He studied in front of the law, the studio stopped, later biology, then he became interested in computers, and eventually he became a stone dealer.
And a lover of stones.
He's got 40,000 tons of stones.
He owns his own treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer with old stones in the Republic.
It's cold.
In the snow, the artist is lying on a piece of paper.
"One time they were at the Marien bridge in Dražjana," he says.
A writer from Labe, yellow, warm, excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on our way up the woods.
It points to a group: a red pessimist, a former part of the countryside in Karlsruhe.
And then.
"A nice travertine."
One time, those squares were at the Neckartadon court in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidential in Stuttgart, red granite from Sankt Blasien temple, a tube from the hospital in Heilbron.
What a job, what a job, what a way.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were previously handyed and carried with the help of simple chasms and running vehicles, he becomes quite active.
"It would be a scandal if something like that happened."
He's not rich, he's not very rich at all.
The stone dealer today employs 14 people, and in addition, up into the forest, they have planted stones, one sugar, one cup, one glass and one garden.
"We're working hard, but it's comforting," says the one who evaluates the rest.
He's got to go to Colina in the meantime.
There'll be rocks there, too.
High-potential talent race
There's a lot of people in the neighborhood.
16 students are stuck in breads with rice, raisins and sweetness.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Car Manufacturers of Volkswagen invited students to the workshop.
Together with VW's developers here, they should talk about the car of the future - and that's the way to get to know Volkswagen.
A lot of companies are trying to get the smartest head in the race, just like VW, successful and successful in co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: What may be the first to steal from the most profitable graduates in the audience, even before they get to the labour market and take care of others.
Since universities do not provide any list of students' success, companies are trying to show exceptional talents in practical-oriented projects and get them.
At TU Braunschweig the car company is trying to get talent next day.
One young lady from the personal department distributes props, rubber rings and discs with VW logo.
He provides reliable young talent about programmes in practice, student jobs, and points them out on the way to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is looking at the project together with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students will get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"In the meantime, students can get to know each other, get to know the interesting candidates, and think about who would be acting as a co-workers."
Such cooperation, according to Sele, is not unusual.
But the news is that he's so open about the students.
"Jinak was rather an essential professional project," says Sele.
The fight against pure absolutes will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer select their employees from long-term representatives.
On the contrary, efforts must be made and efforts must be made, in particular, of highly qualified labour force.
In particular, the graduates of engineering teams have excellent coordination positions.
According to VDI's Svazu, the German engineers remained in the ranks of 40,000 uncontained positions.
And according to VDI's forecast, there's still a shortage of engineers.
For the auditory and advisory company KPMG, Roman Dykt is on the hunt for talents.
It organises a handy Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern base race where participants need to find a route according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send these eight dedicated students to the United States next year.
At the same time, participants can look at the KPMG area and contact the company.
Firstly, it shall be decided on two selection paths who will participate.
Only Créme de la Créme from many interested people fly to the United States.
In the High potentials of the universities, they will pay under the Dikts they will continue to be stricter laws.
"We want to separate ourselves from the rest of the race."
"A simple trip to the beach was too small for us."
Looks like the talent hunter Dykta's lucky.
"We remained in contact with all participants like this in the past year."
"Some will soon finish the study and plan to get to work," she says.
In addition to direct speech on the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises present classics on third parties.
"We're trying to contact the graduates at the professional exhibitions."
"For example on Intersolar," suggests Sitha Stübe, the leading solar technology manufacturer's personal department.
The company from Bonn employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Steps know the problem with young workers.
At the present time, 35 posts have been posted on the website of companies.
"At the present time, it's just complicated, it's free space."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another possibility is contacting teachers at universities.
Solarworld works with various high schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors know that we can do practice or write a degree job."
Solar specialist doesn't order any expensive advertising actions.
Instead, the company tries to ease other benefits: personal atmosphere, low hierarchies and easy communication.
"Great companies can't offer it often," says the head of the staff department of Stébe.
When looking for work, money doesn't play a major role for a long time.
Flexible working time, child care or good practice options are other factors that make this possible.
Solarworld based on a study of the Great Place to Work 55. place among 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute is the annual list of best German employees.
In addition, employees are asked how they are at peace with their work and the working environment and follow the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the staff department of Stébe hopes that her placement will bring points to the employers for work.
"I believe that stakeholders are particularly informed about the external evaluations of potential employees," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good experience as an employer.
He's recommending his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, this is the first internal measure.
"The best way to look at yourself as an attractive employee is through your own employees," he says.
It is officially called the Internal Employment Branding, and therefore the placing of employees on the market within the framework of their own employees.
"Supposing employees is the best envoys."
When a company is well-known for its people and they identify themselves with the company, they will make themselves available to their employees among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with a ride," says Kriegler.
Both stop the new romans
During the next few years, the U.S. State of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico, has not yet reached a new red river.
The Washington government issued the corresponding order - and thus cancelled the previous plans with the finality of the plan.
New markets are still under ban in front of the Atlantic coast.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar sent it in the middle.
The reason for the direct order that should be paid at least for the following five years is the explosion at the bottom of the Deepwater Horizon.
Before this accident, which left ten employees alive and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled an attack on the opposition and the industry of his will to allow for new markets in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The rest of the population is trying to reduce the US dependence on the supplements from the country.
To date, it is not explicitly explained who is responsible for the destruction of the oil crop in the lake.
In the middle of the crisis, the British Energy Group is a BP which is faced with billions of requests.
The investigation commission entrusted to Obama should submit the results during the week.
In October, Minister inside Ken Salazar canceled the award order he paid for the explosion.
As a result, various rosy groups of applications were submitted for new gardening purposes.
Both of them and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters from becoming more closely controlled and strict security regulations.
At the present time, the control authority is essentially reformed, which has warned itself of many corrupt charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would reduce the lucrative opportunities of taxpayers for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that more precise regulation will significantly reduce the volume of heavy oil in the sea.
"The government plans are the largest speed for the growth of the oil and steel industry," says the results of the current study in the BDO Advisory Group - even before the middle ban.
American Energy Alliance is still struggling with insecurity in the area: "No one knows exactly what changes are going on."
Investments in new labour projects are under way until the call is made - for growth.
Region Ogoni Sparrows
The water in the rivers is oily, flowing like a pump: billions of litres of unique roses have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corruption, and illegal smoking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't touch yourself," says the environmental journalist, "you'll get a lot of bad shit in front of your target today."
37-year-old Nigeriaanec was following the attempt to photograph the boy who is sailing through the water that surrounds the snow: this scene moves into the water lake with spiritual colors almost as beautiful.
The fact that under the blue surface of the snow-cracked roses, it's not seen.
Previously, she had gathered enough grain here, reports Esther Bad on the edge of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, a bit of floating water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large number of roses came into the vast area.
The fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must spend at least six hours to get to the water where the fish are: the region of Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger river, belongs to one of the biggest frozen areas in the world.
The route along the river of mangrove pools with a large number of side points is the first known whole range of the village.
A man's engine burns instead of light water, it burns a box and whoever pushes his hand into the water, pulls out the oil rings.
The roots of manoeuvres depend on the land as a black piece of medicine, the leaves that emerge from palm leaves leave their leaves unsatisfied.
We're looking for beautiful birds, which are usually provided in cold areas: As soon as the engine is quiet on the floor, it spreads in the front row, where it smells like pumps, scary silence.
"What is being played here is the ecological leadership of war," laments Celestine Akpobari, "we live in constant fear of health."
The comparison with war is justified.
The Ogooni settlement area is a vital field where it has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago the first residents of Europe gathered here, here in the 1980s, created the first battle with later-adjusted writer Ken Saro-Wowa, where the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was very dangerous for employees.
To date, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while the whole area of the three sizes of Switzerland is more than 5000 square miles [7,000 sq km] of driving more than two million black gold barrels, it lies a rough field in the Ogoni area, this situation is very unstable for the group.
Every several hundred meters depend on the water of the steel structure as a dry soybeans: "Funny Trees", so much so called the heads of the garden openings.
They're 50 years old, mostly at sea.
Every minute, the head of the garden opens, Akpobari reports, and then pours a constant drop of roses into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters per 50 years went into the ecosystem: Every year, the amount of roses that came to the sea in Aljašky in the disaster of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest disasters in the history of mankind.
They're arguing who's still responsible for the continuing ecological accident.
While the Shell Group marks a sabout and organized robin theft of more than 90 per cent of the pollution, it speaks of the environmental protection of the living environment about empty heads of the gates and uncluttered guides, such as the main cause.
Shell demands much less safety regulations than in the world, said a group in 2008 US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Except for the number of drivers, it's just "a few times higher than the others".
In a place that looks from far away as abandoned, oil-pressed part under the wide sky, comes out of manoeuvres: they are completely wet and after the circle from the oil.
Under one of the many courts, which are partly linked with leadership, partly voluntarily scattered across the country, fire is burning: illegal small refinery.
Rope's been burning in the fire court for hours, explains Michael, the lead team.
Before running from driving to the bottom of the tank, later cap at the end of driving the kerosin and the end of the oil.
In this way Michael and his four employees make up up to four judges per 300 litres: "We'll do that 34,000 Naira" - around $22.
Residents use chronic shortness of weight in the largest black African state.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A relatively low price of 40 cents per litre of oil can still be passed by illegal producers: because they have free raw materials.
It comes from "bunkers", who are engaged to lead everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, in the whole area of the Niger River, the country loses at least 16 million litres of oil per day.
But only a relatively small portion of provisionally stored raw materials are illegal: most of the fully organised criminal network, which also has to belong to politics and high positions of representatives of the army, to tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate, whether caused by the disaster of the citizens and their stocks or their lax method of production, considers Akpobari activists to be a clean academic.
"If the same companies were not considered to be thieves and if they did not destroy the livelihood of fishermen, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, the relationship with Ogoni is especially so damaged to Shell that it appears only in the view of the departure of the group: "Maybe other nations such as China as better will be shown."
Michael's sad.
"The tallest time for you to make a mistake," says the famous manufacturer.
"The soldiers can come at any time."
If they find a special military unit, they're not going to be threatened with imprisonment, but a painful charge.
Also, soldiers who come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to benefit from the raw materials.
"That damn thing got our country in all respects to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Inspectors have found a dangerous construction error in engines A380
A380 obviously has a great security undertaking.
Researchers have found a possible construction error that could lead to a "distortion of the engine".
Kantas Airport wants to complain about the engine manufacturer.
The travel airbus of the Kantas company had apparently more happiness at the start of November than has been known: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority has found a great security undertaking on some A380 engines - and now warns against possible construction failure.
The undertaking may have serious consequences: a single oil connection could result in dust due to the need, this Thursday was set out in a published statement by the ATSB Authority.
This fact could lead to a "dangerous engine crash".
It's about the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 flights of the A380 series.
Among them, there is also an airbus of Kantas, who had to arrive in Singapore on 4 November.
Australia's airline has now taken legal steps against British turbine producers.
The appeal was filed at the Australian Federal Court of Justice in Sydney, allowing further legal measures against this company.
The head of Kantas Alan Joyce said his company would ask for compensation for an incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and they damaged the nose.
Rolls-Royce identified the cause of the damage to fuel oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be switched around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with the planes equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, speecher ATSB Martin Dolan said.
The safety deficiencies were considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency engine had arrived, Kantas left his flying company A380 on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its units A380 across the country.
Lufthansa has replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.
Double flight is the largest personal flight in the world.
National cuts cause chaos in the right
The Germans are all white: almost all over the country have snowed through the night.
On many roads the government chaos, trains and aircraft connections have been destroyed.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Germany's winter of hate: almost the entire Republic fell on Thursday at winter temperatures - leading to many places to transport chaos.
It lies in some places north and east up to 15 inches [15 cm] snow.
On a few distances and a lot of roads, there is a very limited transport.
At A7 in Flensburg, the railway service was still in progress, but did not lead to new dreams.
There was still a strong wave wind over the Baltic Sea.
The BSH is expected to be at the Baltic Sea coast in Šlesvik-Holštínsk on the afternoon of the storm with a water position of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snow shelters in Saskatchewan have caused significant problems in the streets and in the public roads.
According to the centre of the bad weather, Meteomedia was therefore the highest rate in Switzerland for the plague - even the highest rate.
In part, 30 centimetres of the new snow, strong and fresh winds caused a storm.
There were several expensive and personal cars left there during the night.
Also in Saskatchewan-Anhalt, police authorities reported serious road problems.
On A2, the wind and snow caused a slow operation and shock.
In Durinsk, there were problems with snow at A4 and A9.
According to the German drama, there is a great deal of difficulty in Sasku-Anhaltsk, Durynsk and in northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, turned trees on the tracks or broken mountain directions and exits.
In Saska, a long journey from Lipska to Norimberg was to be stopped.
In the door-to-door Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Mnichov.
165 passengers got in the train from passengers and rescuers loaded with blankets, food and drink.
Snow wind war through the train.
In large German airports, snow winds have been destroyed for many years.
According to the information centres for the years has already been reported from Mnichov for years.
In Frankfurt to Mohan, it has been broken down by Fraport for 40 years.
The maintenance of the train is in constant contact.
There were only a few passengers on the airport, but 400 full beds were prepared for them.
A lot of roads have already come to me in the middle of the night.
Last night, one driver of a cost-effective car died in a train crash on a train in eastern Holstínsk.
The driver was easily injured.
A similar accident occurred near Norimberka due to an accident: a cost car was also caught on a railway journey because the vehicle was driven.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - a trail from Bayreuth to Norimberg, which remained until the morning hours were closed.
And a 30-year-old woman died after she moved to Aschaffenburg with her car.
Meteorologists, however, have a good message: snow will remain in the form of light rain, and will therefore be raised in the light of the wind.
But the wind will melt.
Except in the Baltic Sea, there'll be quick winds on the force of the storm.
But it's going to be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for couples
Deutsche Bank wants to settle with its mark: according to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two coins with officers at the headquarters of Frankfurt.
Property could amount to EUR 500 million.
Deutsche Bank just renovate its seat of the group: two-year-olds in the Frenchfurt bank quarter were modernized; however, bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
Now, however, he obviously wants the financial cost group to renovate again - and he's looking for the buyers for both of the darknessheads, as he informs "Financial Times Deutschland" with a call to speak.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still testing whether it's more meaningful properties to own or sell and then find it again," he said.
This is why the largest credit institution in Germany will return to its company headquarters in the short term.
The Bank took a fresh-two-price first in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from its own fund investors and then renovate it accordingly.
Energy transfer of sex according to data of around EUR 200 million.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
The experts from the area refer to the value of the new text among the thresholds referred to in the Greentowers at the price of around EUR 500 million.
The speaker said that it was not decided whether the building would be reselled into the property of the fund or an independent investor.
Thousands are tired of dead horrendous
More than 10,000 people have won the memory of sleepy mountaintops on New Zealand, who have been declared dead after several explosions down there.
It has not yet been possible to release the dead because the security situation continues to be complex.
Nearly two weeks ago, the town of Greymouth arrived at the Pike River Mine.
29 tops of the age of 17 to 62 were down.
To the store where the accident occurred, the probe was dropped, but it didn't reveal any step in life.
As a result of high concentrations of evaporative fluids and subsequent explosions, safety forces could not be found.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts emerged from having no chance of survival.
He hasn't been able to release the dead yet.
Now they've lost the memory of dead neighbors and friends.
In Greymouth on the south of New Zealand, tens of thousands of people gathered during the sun’s time.
They've been in the dark for two minutes.
29 tables, helmets, lights and names of crowns were built for the celebration of the memorials of the tombs.
Also pictures and personal things, such as clothes and surfing fingers, have found their place here.
In the state state buildings, the trains were on half the yards.
New Zealand hoped that the topmen would again come out of the "deep country" on the ground, said the memory action of the Prime Minister's New Zealand President John Key.
"But they never came home."
He can't get away with his son until he sees his dead, said Laurie Drew, whose son Zen was trapped down.
A number of foreign diplomats were also participated in the Memorial event in addition to the Prime Minister's president and the victim's visits.
During the explosion on 19 November, British and South African mountain rangers were also attacked.
The rescuers started by putting a fire in the deep bottom on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the current gas is released, it begins with the freezing of high temperature inside the floor, said police president Gary Knowles.
Get the hell out of here, soldier!
Is the horror going on to an artist's movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refung is trying to regain the old border with his war era "Wallallalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he said "Wallallalla Rising"?
The busy Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and in large slaughters almost with the overprivileged strength of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young Spanish savages who are looking for blood action because our garden helps the cruel methods of killing and its enemies even the insides of the breast when it has bad cold.
On the other hand, as is actually called, during the entire film it will not say a word and the rest of the articles will bring at least one or two candles or will be allowed to bow to the strastyful dying screams.
Otherwise, it smells and plays in a very beautiful, beautiful, cosy territory of Scotland, which offers the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for the adult superiority of cinema with an interest in existentialism and a very comfortable set of cameras.
It's good if there's a movie of more target groups, it's just damage when they get apart.
Director Winding Refn, after he applied his wild and styling trilogy on drug dealers "Pusher", is considered to be a Danish version of Director Quentina Tarantina, but the stocks are protected to approach his work to be more humoured by the main product or less brutal to the artistic public.
Most of the performers of an artist’s cinema are obviously allowed to perform all manner of brains and internalities.
Activists will be released at the latest at the moment when the United Nations is released for free explanation with a group of violent Christian missionaries on board Jerusalem and will remain alive forever in the air and the tongue until it reaches America and remains silent.
It's not surprising, then, that Wallalla Rising didn't get into the kitchen in Germany and now he was just released on DVD.
It is particularly harmful for beautiful gatherings, but also because of the private façade, places where blood is shed, is hiding a shocking movie that deserves a little attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogue or exact action, it's all an atmosphere, a hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for a great escape.
The reff doesn't even give him a moment of release and slow him down with his nightmares and a hormonal hypnotic soundtrack, especially an unfavourable hate that will break out of his heart.
Just a little blond boy who helps the One, leaves something like innocence, all the others are motivated by evil.
Of all the one host whose motives are never explained, which will become a time for enemies and a transition from war to war with hell, possibly a devil messenger.
He's making a deal, maybe, but only for those who're in charge.
"Wahalla Rising" is a fascinating movie that is possible to hate and admire, for breaking, breaking and eating.
Let's go.
Landing work
The IAEA nuclear power agency has a new warning on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country is protecting expression, and it's not even allowed to control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli warplanes F-15 and the 4th building in Syria will be attacked.
They are located on the Euphrates coast; the nearest city is 30 kilometers away and the name is Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Authority (IAEA), its name shall be published when it is referred to as a reactor which has been set up by Syria with the help of North Korea in this quarter hidden in the valley, which is exempt from the sale.
On the basis of a communication from the US-American Foreign Service CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village el-Kibar, was well placed on the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be installed.
The technology of the 20s doesn't work on anything else.
The CIA has presented video with unscathed satellite photos.
Using computer animation, she explained where the reactor components could be before the destruction, it should refer to a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
Moreover, there were still some photographs that showed the building close or even inside.
The reactor was just a short time before the launch, but still without burning articles.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it doesn't matter much more than a few more times, even the chaos has increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently announced in his memory that the CIA was very sure that Syria was in El-Kibar reactor, but essentially it did not have the basis that there is an "active nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
Some reporting services in Europe are even more careful and speak only about "a data reactor", even though the CIA's presentations consider "a reliable one".
They lack clear evidence, just like IAEA.
When asked how he is sure that he has a reactor in front of him, the UN high diplomat in summer, IAEA has only "a sufficient amount of material to answer questions".
In fact, the court "unused military buildings" was quickly dismissed by the Syrians, and they also had a proper level of ground.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, the IAEA team was under the leadership of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in El-Kibar, who was made by people.
In addition, IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial sellers from the time after the attack, which should be higher than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these restrictions are not on the market because he bought exclusively an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
That's why the IAEA cannot confirm their rights.
Syria has always claimed that she never had a secret nuclear programme and has not set up a reactor.
The Uranian comes from Israel's weapons, the Damascus is revealed.
But that's what returned the IAEA after the partial analysis.
From that time on, Damaszek refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite closures.
In addition, he ordered the auditors to have another inspection in El-Kibar and access to a few bombed buildings.
But Israel is also mild - tempered.
"We will never comment on this," confirmed a recent official opinion in the current ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case will be carried out without delay since June 2008 and "in view of the firm's reliability" as admitted by the high Western diplomat in the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - a serious breach of the nuclear arms ban agreement that the IAEA considers.
The IAEA considers it to be the key to progress in the process of three other devices that should be "in a functional connection" with a particular reactor - and there is still a difference between them.
The auditors did not then provide any information on any device or any of their functions or why they were suspects.
According to the news, Süddeutsche Zeitung is the IAEA internally marked as Marj as as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah, driven again by nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found them on satellite video sets, which is probably one of the suspects.
Apparently, there is a military base within or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - that is why Syria refuses to access the IAEA to these three places.
In Vienna, it claimed that Syria was afraid of such fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent to the United States to restore the military base.
Nuclear detectives were warned about the U.S. secret service device.
The IAEA also has the bases and satellite images that the material was transported here and there between these three places and four quarters of the Euphrates.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one facility should be "in relation to fuel production".
However, there are no "no evidence of sensible activities", hence of the cultivation of uranium and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by an uranium network that is not covered.
But where the uranium comes from and where plutonium should be left on the bomb later, there are only likely answers to these central questions.
It is also unknown whether the pieces that could hide the important steps are stored in these three places.
The Jacobs disappeared from the land cost of expensive vehicles, and no one seems to have any information from where that court came from.
Just a few miles from El-Kibar away and on the other side of Euphruta lies the sundial part of al-Tibni, which in 1998 allowed Syria to check as an appropriate fund for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelly gave him into contact with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for a renouncing Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
Photos from the universe, however, show that, after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all suspected land jobs and removed large containers.
He could have talked about the deal, but he couldn't explain the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles are talking about the fact that IAEA has spent many months developing a revision plan, which would allow Syria to retain any military secret - only this myth shows how much interest the auditors have.
Damaszek, among other things, rejected this proposal.
If the western diplomats in Vienna were still satisfied with the fact that the reactor has been destroyed, and that's why this thing is not worse, US Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about special inspections, which is one of the strongest means that the video-based nuclear control agency has.
Chief of IAEA Yukiya Amano, who had to propose an inspection, has already spoken about "the possibilities that will be in the future," but it's still wrong.
This election poses a great risk: on the one hand, the need for a majority of the IIAA government council and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in scaling.
On the other hand, how does one diplomat warn, "What happens when they find nothing at all?"
Love in Wartime
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working in summer for the still unmanned regime, there have been difficulties.
She wrote her own scenario about a kind story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
He doesn't know much about it yet, but he doesn't.
She was referring to the fact that during the war in Yugoslavia, this Muslim woman fell in love with the Serbian man who raped her.
The Bosnian women's forces were protesting immediately, so they immediately moved planned attacks from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film was mixed up in Hungary and was in post-producing, but still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Women's War Victims' Organization wrote through the UN-Organization with the help of UNHCR Jolie refugees and requested a meeting with the heretic, informing now the Bosnian news - Jolie is also a major UN-Organization with the help of refugees.
It's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a week ago in Hungary, which they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the camps where it was attacked, merciful stories were not realized, and Jolie's position against the victim reveals enough about the scenario.
Her organization therefore recommended that the UN organization help the refugees to release Jolie as a volunteer informs Guardian.
What scene exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has been able to read her scenario, has allowed for smaller halls in Sarajevo to be found - it is not quite clear why Jolie has not responded.
The young author points out that in his film he does not follow any political idea that he has committed a major conflict in Yugoslavia, that he wants to show the terrible consequences of war and to give space to all the parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains intact.
There is another version of the film that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the start of the war and met again when she is as a Bosnian Muslim dragged into a Serbian camp where she serves as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than "the victim of rape is in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war - it's true.
Jolie assumes that there's a pressure on her that "is not fair and is based on false information".
Now she can be released from Hollywood's Hekers: By publicly illegally on the Internet, her stager has done so many times.
Nothing else
This evening it's once again good for Iry.
No way to go to jail.
The domestic team dominates very well over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans are happy to hear the voice of the song, the dumb feet.
Bailey-Pub in York Cork is hot, because players heat tennis balls up to three meters away into the beer chains - and they need to.
The "Pion Pong" is called the Biar Festival and is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and for this flight to Las Vegas on the world's bridge in the Piano Bridge in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this stuck beer game and sustainable information, it doesn't work very well.
Still, a 26-year-old man is trying to get involved, to answer such questions as to what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play in Las Vegas, going to New Zealand in January.
"I have such a wonderful feeling," she says.
"It's so far away and I still don't have a job."
Still: His friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "Furtherly she got her perfect job as Eventmanger, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of the bad look of the house, two of Tanner's three cousins have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT adviser in London.
Boys go away: Like Tanners, it looks like it's in many families on the island.
100 000 Irish leave at the time of the country's departure, the experts of the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of ESRI in Dublin.
They count up to the year 2015 with 200,000 immigrants.
For a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, they will come to a similar exploding wave as Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After ten years of accession, which brought great prosperity to Ireland, the disillusionment is now widening again.
The economic crisis is especially devastating to young people, educated in Ireland, who have just survived.
The loss of employment and social cohesion seemed absurd in these years.
Everyone needs it, money was too much.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men have been unemployed for three and a half years.
In Irish Times there are many letters of readers who complain, "In Ireland everything is going from the top."
"We should come up against politicians and bankers - who can, that goes away and our country will lose the entire generation."
"The last one, please, will be gone."
The student of Law of Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government offers no prospects for the future for young people.
"They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategies to create new jobs," says 20-year-old.
She notices how her colleagues vary from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is she'll have to move herself in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressive."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organises "WorkingAbroadExpo", a exhibition that offers a full service on foreign work.
"For starters on the labour market, work abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on the career market," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboards in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a career, but freedom and joy.
About what it's like to build something somewhere else, he knows about half a year ago Sean O'Donovan.
Because the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues at the building in Germany.
It's located in Gelsenkirchen's fashion house.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan will eventually get a rent at home, because he works in extra shifts so he can pay his rent at home.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," she says, when it first passes over the right of her own home for a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany at a house in Ireland where I'm not basically at all."
He laughs and walks in cold rooms.
The small house is located in a good fourth with maintained garages, a large expensive car park on the streets.
O'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago for EUR 380.000 - 100% funded by the loan.
"It was a crazy time, just money was without a lot of questions," he says.
Is he afraid it wouldn't work out with the money?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, a hot tea comes down and says, "I don't have children that I should live, and I'm young; even if everything turns dark, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn't like the order that he's hearing so often now.
"No one should be hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as before on this island," he says.
"When we work abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like Iro."
He laughs and then reports about his father who left for the last economic crisis to England.
"After seven years he was back and his life was running back to Ireland, quite simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the open future and just wait for another life to develop.
He's been working in London for years, too, and why shouldn't it be on New Zealand for him and his friend too?
But there is one more thing that concerns him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
They're afraid she could focus on the wedding celebration.
"Mostly no emotion," she says and drinks well.
"Oh, my God, it sounds so sad."
"Let's call it a holiday celebration, totally simple, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few here."
The practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private business.
The active activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer survey that took place in 18 countries and went exclusively to The Economist magazine.
Since the study has been regularly carried out since 1995, it can monitor changes in existing areas above all.
In an annual survey that ran into the shadow and began to run, two related things dominate.
The first of these is that Latin America has a relatively happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of the positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries in the Pacific region in South America has grown significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth is averaged 6% annually, the support for democracy grew from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
She also grew up in Mexico, where the economy reacted after a severe decline in production in the late 1990s.
But only about half of the questions raised in Mexico and Brazil, two most recent areas, are the conviction of democracy, which is a regional dimension (see figure 2).
About 44% of respondents throughout the region expressed peace with their country's functioning in practice, the same number as in the last year, but compared to 2001 when 25% was compared to the big growth (graph 3).
The total of 34% indicated that they trust snow in their country and 45% trust the government, once again it is the same number as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy collapsed in Latin America was a economic crisis.
Support during the world financial crisis was likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were suffering only a brief recession and were enjoying a strong recovery.
In addition, the stronger social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission of the Organisation of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased in 2009 only by 32% in 2009 and that in that year it was 32%.)
However, it changes in a broad spectrum from land to land (see Figure 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luise Inácia Luly da Silvy, is reflected in the broadly accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the situation of violent criminal activity deteriorated.
For the first time since the investigation, more respondents have seen Latin America as the most important problem of crime more than unemployment (see paragraph 5).
The total of 31% says that either they themselves or their neighbours have become victims of criminal activity in the last year, but this is a decrease compared to the 38% data from last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
The greater economic performance is reflected in growing support for private businesses and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the whole area say that private enterprises are needed for development, this percentage has grown from 56% in 2007 (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that enables the development of their countries, this percentage has grown from 47% since last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private businesses), although their Left President, Hugo Chávez, has many private companies.
Brazil is a country that has leadership in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (about 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, sales in the last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, sales 11% in the last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential countries in Mexico and in much of Central America, while Venezuela is more successful in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised choices
No one expected that the general elections in Haiti would be perfect on November 28th.
But they were much worse than the outsiders who are trying to help the conquered country to be afraid.
The volleyballs were full of Urs and repeated voting, voting lines scattered across the channels, broken volleyball rooms and alarming.
Free rooms opened after hours of delay.
Many of the Haitians, including many who were displaced because of the earthquake, fled across and tried to find out where they could go.
Some of them finally gave it up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of pre-supposed presidents, called for the debate and called for the vote to be cancelled.
The protests, some of which were violent, spread throughout the country.
Despite Edmond Mulet, a highly established UN official in Haiti, declared that "in many respects it was quite a good choice."
Observers from the Organization of the American States and the Caribbean Community have carefully said that "he does not believe that these imbalances, however serious, did not necessarily break the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority whose opposition votes are bound by René Préval, a non-popular candidate and his candidate Jude Celestin, shall notify the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected solvent is intended for ice cream.
Not all popular hopes are lost.
Two former opposition candidates Michel Martelli, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former lady, resigned from their original challenge to be declared free of charge.
The problem may arise, however, if Mr Celestin, who has little or no support between the voters, will be appointed by the electoral committee for obtaining a ruling file.
Because of the terrible epidemics of corruption and more than 1 million people who still live after the earthquake, there have been concerns that voluntary participation will be lower.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but for reasons of de-organisation, they were banned.
The 250 thousand evidence of identity that is necessary for voting remain briefly before the elections.
There's a lot in the bag.
The Tarci sees the election of legitimate and popular governments as a fundamental step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it's clear, then, that the Haitians are based on it themselves.
After the jumps to the center
In the weeks when she came here, she was pregnant by Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, with a public sympathies when her popularity moved from 20 to 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Despite this success in the successful campaign for the second functional period of elections in the coming year, it can be based on the fact that Mrs. Fernández’s frustration with his wife, leader and political partner, Néstore Kirchner, is not compatible.
And in these terms, everything's going to be done.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy and after his wife successfully became president, had been accustomed to drawing up budgets that were consistent with tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first pair to lose another income for the favor.
Mrs. Fernández's government has lost most of it in the late year of Congress.
But the opposition was divided and further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner on 27 October infarction.
Some members of the ruling political party of Peronist joined Mrs. Fernández.
However, after Chaotit's meetings (which led to the falsification and prosecution of the government from corruption), Congress was unable to accept the 2011 budget.
"I don't agree," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also be paid for the next year, while the president will have more space to spend on leisure.
The economy is overloaded: this year is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but many private opinions and opinions are talking about numbers that are close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who came to the office in 2003, when Argentina was experiencing economic collapse, placed the priority on growth and poverty reduction more than on inflation control.
He refused to join the MMF, pressed the private sector and cleaned the INDEC, a statistical agency that was involved in monitoring official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now settle this policy?
She called for a meeting between private companies and committee transfers.
And her officials say they want to limit growth by 18% next year.
The economy was supported by an increase in world prices for the export of Argentina agricultural products.
But inflation broke the growth based on major deficits in 2002.
That may be why Mrs. Fernández is telling us that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government established an agreement with the debtor who previously refused the restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Now Mrs. Fernández's face is the deal with the faithful governments that are formed in the Paris Club, which owes $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact be out of the control of MMF as usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the minister of the economy announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance", in order to design a new national consumer price index that would recall the introduction to the INDEC cleaning.
It is not quite clear whether Mrs. Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of the working period when the husband is no longer her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get support from the middle class, which is inspired by churchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentinians from the summer's vacation, they'll have their own sympathies.
If he wants to win another election, he will have to decide whether there will be no need to express many of the views that her husband has held in politics.
Half-life heating for China
The Taiwanese volunteers are closer to a closer relationship with the fortress.
What does Taiwan think of her big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 billion voters, 70% of the eligible, voted on 27 November of the age and councils of the city in five urban districts, which can be considered to be the broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. President Ma is the only representative of the feelings that are firmly governed and firmly established in business relations, including agreements on partial free trade, in the largest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma has passed the test, but it's only true.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) had completed three out of five senior officials, he was unable to win most votes.
According to this Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is committed to greater independence in Taiwan, received nearly 50% of all votes against 45% of KMT.
If it were to talk about the presidential will, President Ma would have trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has decreased by about 8%.
The first was the DPP side together with KMT in the city councils.
The volleyballs were played as the majority of Taiwanese volleyballs, which include partial volleyball cars and mass gathering with trainers against dressed girls.
The participation was even a mandatory secret attempt on the accent.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chana, the honour president of KMT, was to act for KMT's candidates in the evening of the election.
The man from the roof shot young Mr. Lien clean up his face, hurt her, and killed a monster.
It was not strictly determined whether the weapon was intended to hurt Mr. Liena or to face a conflict with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leading DPP, claims that the shooting affected the volition, suspects fall on the DPP and leads to KMT.
Almost the only big win of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how she remained behind the question of her own strength.
Instead, the candidates were involved in plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
KMT therefore tends to avoid government duties in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also left behind the emergence of anti-Chinese positions.
It is a reaction to the reality and to realize that the Chinese trade has a fundamental role to play in the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. President Ma confirmed for his part that China's policy is acceptable for most Taiwan.
From the Beijing government, it can be expected that it will continue to continue in commercial payments, together with its strategy to restore Taiwan to its state.
China did not spend time sending a mediator to Taipei to arrange a summaries on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in a series of ways.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
In any case, the DPP party appeared on its own.
Two years ago she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000-08 was a fugitive and a stay of clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation developed, which is moderated and DPP works hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was summoned as a DPP candidate to the president, such as Su Tseng-changem, who stood the office under Mr. Chen.
Their side now does everything to show that they can also work with Peking.
Ms. Tsai has published plans for research institutions that serve as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their meetings can be conducted without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai reports to the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "confidential alternative" to Mr. Ma's busy access to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be upset with this song.
In a statement issued from his target, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would do better if they continued to believe that Taiwan is a single country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatics not to apply for president.
But even without Mr. Chena's consent, the DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessment was wrong, even over the transition pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His unfathomableness may be based, in particular, on unemployment and a profound breakdown between the rich and the poor.
Speaking KMT says he reorganizes his cabinet, just like the local areas.
The strong proposals for Taiwan's support for bonding friendships are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chianga, a prominent publisher, "the point from which it's not a return has already fallen."
Nomination at the price Grammy: Jazzzová song Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
The President's request and the people have to take a look at the law.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old bastist and singer chosen by President Obama to present at the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, is marked as one of the surprises of the Grammy prize this year with nominations in the category of the best new artist.
In view of the fact that Spalding was celebrated as a railway stage since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with the rules of Grammy, when the artist should not issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious album from 2010 "Chamber Music Society" has certainly recorded the steps of the past and thanks to her ageless vocal style and the dead hand with the first pop, fun and Latin influence, we can talk about Spalding as a success, which was recorded in 2003 by Nora Jones, the closest equivalent to the voter in Grammy, who are looking for similar railway work in this category for the last year.
Jinde jurors Grammy's right evaluate the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, triggering, refreshing the ride of the album, which was a hot favorite in the late years.
Iyer will compete against the album of James Moody's tried saxophonist, Moody 4B, and John Beasley's keyman, Positootly.
Thrombone Shorty, a graphic favorite from New Orleans and a prestigious guest in the HBO "Treme" series was assessed in the contemporary railway category, which is otherwise impressed by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorbera albums.
The dive group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained a number of credit recognitions in the category of big files when in competition it became a commercial jazz Children Ensemble and still courageous Dave Holland, whose live album with the cover "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how to have a free hand base as a capillary.
Nominations Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classic music categories
Nominations in classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd Grammy annual prices.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" have a piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a number of three points.
The Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphonie No. 4 "Los Angeles" appeared among the famous competitions in South California, a work organized by Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The co-founder at L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance of evaluation.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, collection and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music year has five named Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Malinson.
At the classic album, Bruckner and his Symphonie received no. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" from Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacificum - the Art of the Castrate" introducing various artists; and Verdiho "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for categories of operas, nominations are Berg and "Lulu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse a "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Marinesky Theatre; a Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated for Grammy for modern stock, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionateté Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graphiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had a premier at Disney Hall in January 2009 at the exhibition, which was played by L.A. Philharmonic under the tactical Esa-Pekka Salonna.
About 30 minutes of work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to an ex-combatant of Michael Khodorkovsky, who has been imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for the instrumental exhibition of soloists with orchestra.
L.A.'s composer noted that he wrote 15 minutes of work especially for the Mandlin interpreter Avi Avitila, who attended a concert with Metropolis Ensemble in New York.
"I wrote it with the help of tons from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received nominations in the category for orchestral performance, to lead Chicago Symphony in recording Stravinsk's work.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nominations were the pianist Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the poet Paul Jacobs; the artist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the so-called vocal soloists were only women, including Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the transitional category of the classics, she received the nominations of the sopranoist Jesse Norman for her "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned meeting in Temecule is approved by the planning committee
The planned meeting in Temecule received a unanimous support from the local planning commission in more than five hours often from a zealous public witness.
Critics have attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the cessation of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically motivated.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews whom you remember," Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, said on Thursday.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always triumphs."
"The opposition is minimal" added.
"Those who are opposed only shout out loud."
"We have really good people at our disposal."
The meeting started at six o’clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight when the majority of the people who were for or against the centre were held discussions. These voices were equally divided, the press-Enterprise gives.
The discussions continued on the web pages of the news.
"America no longer exists," said one comment.
"We are the planet's opponents with Socho's freedom fall into the sand."
"America's style."
The planned Islamic Centre also launched protests in other parts of the country, including the proximity of the Ground Zero, a tragedy that took place on 11 September 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley, I have Mahmoud Harmous violence.
His religious village, which read about 135 families, joined the Riverside County after a year without an incident, but he added more and more space than the storage space that he found together with the producer of filter systems.
The new mixture of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and grow to 43 feet.
She should take a seat at the 4,32 acre on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
The opposition may continue to call the city council on the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new life types on Earth or elsewhere
The appearance of strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of their animals, expands the space to look for new forms of life on Earth and possibly even further.
Researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has possibilities that are outside the main cells that were already considered and fundamental.
"This organism has two abilities."
"It can grow either by phosphorous or arsenic."
"This reality is very special, but it's not proof that it's a kind of really 'foreign' life form," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science.
It has long been considered necessary for the life of six main cells - carbon, hydrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and acid.
However, scientists have found that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after they are replaced by fossils.
"It's starting to impress you what's still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, the co-author of the news.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, Anbar said.
The study focuses on the microorganisms found on Earth.
However, the report on this newspaper was published to discuss it, which did not reflect the details of the finding, produced a wide range of speculations on the Internet that the report reflects the appearance of foreign life.
It's not like that.
The phenomenon "shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other cells that stimulate biochemistry and that the seed of the cells we consider to be 'standard' must not be so essential for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, Great Britain.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the restoration of one's first in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't an appropriate finding.
Felisa Wolfe-Symon from the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arzen and phosphoric are very similar cells, considering that the microbe that is exposed to both cells can be able to compensate for each other.
"Arzen is expensive mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorous."
"As a result, organisms can be very difficult to separate these cells from themselves."
"But the arsenic is so different that it doesn't work the same as the phosphor. When it comes to the organism, it begins to work in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and present an increasing concentration of arsenic, which are bacteria capable of adapting and growing.
Microbes grow better in the process of phosphorous function, but given that they can also survive with replaced arzene, it increases the possibility that the form of life that uses arzene may appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or month where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an expert microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, said that the idea of an arsenic that could be replaced by a phosphorous is not new, but never found an example that would prove to be true.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that he could use the earlier forms of life.
"This means that there may be other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early days of Earth," Foster, who was not part of the research team Wolfe-Symon.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found, informing the sheriff of the Los Angeles area on Thursday.
Four exhibition dogs - two objects and a lot of pembroke corgis - broke in the evening when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel.
Two dogs were found in the middle of the afternoon and two dogs were left in the middle of the evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles area.
"The good news is the dogs are okay," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where dogs were found in which place he did not share detailed information about their findings.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," said Whitmore.
"We keep the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek were not forced to express themselves to the case.
They were very happy when their two objects were found in the valley of Downey in the middle of the afternoon.
Sheriff's representatives found out and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akity Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old Didi's phenomenon, were unharmed, communicated to the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, members of the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to participate in this week of regional competition on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unattended until their appearance late in the middle.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend the AKC/Eukunuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they were planning to show Trace.
The other dogs had to compete in other competitions planned in the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek said The Times in the middle.
South California is just one stop on nearly a month's trip to Paris by dogs.
Peek and Rickard entered the motel on Monday night.
They often sleep in the bikes and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - the boxer tents, the Parson Russell terriere and the British warehouse - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it should be colder.
They opened a little window so dogs can have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported stealing a car in 6 o'clock in the morning.
Peek said he'd offer an answer to anyone who's going to take them to broken dogs, and dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It wasn't clear on Thursday whether the prices would be made.
Lev is ready to take back now when the restructuring of MGM comes from the court of final approval
After 18 months of drought and insecurity, the MGM finally got green so that it could start again.
The New York Federal Insolvency Court officially announced on Thursday "before the hit" the creditors' plan to rent about $5 billion debt and clean the road for 86 years by an old entertainment company aimed at producing and producing films and television shows.
Fourthly, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Competition Order does not leave any legal impediments to the re-start of Spyglas Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who become the main leading student.
The number of employees is 320 of the originals more than 400.
MGM shall not be excluded from Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase does not qualify for planned financial resources of up to 500 million dollars to finance new MGM operations and production.
Now it's about connecting to the investment bank, which needs 75 million dollars and funding is expected around half a quarter of a week.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co.’s investment bank was hired to advise management on how to solve its finances, since management was fighting to allow interest payments of $300 million a year.
This Serbian president, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former director-general of Enron's company, and an expert at the factory, known for his work on Krispy Krem Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM financial difficulties and 140 students of the study lasted a long time before expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted a number of stakeholders, none of them were willing to pay 2 billion US dollars plus funding that the creditors asked for.
During the summer of the year, everything was back on the rolling stock and the MGM team started to work on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal turmoil, the plan was finally approved by the end of October.
When MGM is officially awarded the competition in the following weeks, Moelise and Coopera will receive multi-hamilion bonus in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which already received $1.2 million, will be paid $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies that account for their services, which run the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for success, i.e. a " Success Fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production in the MGM, which issued only one film this year and to put together seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in funding two films that the book "Hobit" will propose, together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between 265 million and 275 million dollars to finance its share of the two films that will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns around 18% of MGM debt, sought the opportunity to listen to the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent interaction between the two companies did not end up in agreement.
Technological toys that keep your budget on the prize in the balance sheet
The leading candidate for the year is the most amazing iPad game followed by the video system. In both cases, it is one of the best ways to calculate the fee.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99 and one game Kinect is equal to 10 coral reefs or about 48 miles from Play-Doh.
But there's a way to keep your budget in balance.
I recently visited three national players - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic games I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law works; the annual technology games have a lot more energy, and that is, at the same prices, if not something lower, compared with last year.
While there have been relatively fewer new games with shared websites, two of the most famous games of this type, Webbinz and Club Penguin, are offered more.
It increases the number of players with button batteries, just like a player with battery supplyers.
Here are some recommendations.
(All the prices mentioned are from Toys "R" Us, except for cases which are otherwise marked.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, 3 years old) are the flying creatures that sing when you touch them quickly.
At one click, the animal will release the tone and the second press will begin to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmonically.
Warning: As soon as you start kicking, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of music and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, 2 years old)
Last year, I earned a 14-hand animated woman who can play the game of Simon Says and can also have a month's walk thanks to her innovatively tied legs with the blocking of a car.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's game, even though their parents are struggling with a lack of voice control.
If you're a 80-year-old child, you might remember Alphee, one of the first computer learning games.
He's back, (hasbro/Playscool, $40, for children from 3 years), with a bag full of whiskers that are designed to change the ride into a business with a self-restraint, attractive work bag.
If you send on a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the most cheap option with easy use, with keyboard shortcuts, although games do not have as effective as Leopster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change in the Leapster range from Leopfrog, with a new and clearer display.
No version is compatible with the older ones.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for children aged 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce her and e-books and has a slot on SD card that allows her to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children under 8 years) is a five-piece file that is not larger than a tape recorder, each of which has a LED display.
The purpose is to create words by placing a box in a row before it takes time; it is great for competition in the improvised creation of the word.
Still more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
At the highest level, two games were represented in the games of Wekkins and Club Penguin.
If you want to buy your child online game from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figurre Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years of age, which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child will receive enough credit in the Club Penguin store on two favorite items.
This could include a bicycle brush or a Puffle animal.
Something bigger than your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano ($10, for children aged 5 years), the latest of a series of microbots on a button battery.
Brouk is moving fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in the appropriate direction.
It's fun when you make a mess out of the box and see if he can find his way out.
It's very slow, too.
This one of us was able to fall off the kitchen table and spend some time in the dust of our dog.
Introducing easier police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin went to his place, carefully checking his orders and issuing orders with the military authority.
He wanted the women's members - Chinese state officials of the city order, scared and terrified for their strong steps and violence - to have a certain home on the hill of the surrounding.
"Get up straight!"
Hurry up!
Show them, the chips of silence, "like beautiful girls!"
Four large young girls in white gloves and the same olive coffees and pancakes stood in the eye.
Four pairs of black boots are sorted according to the rule.
The four heads of the head are perfectly seated on the feet that are perfectly bound with blue and white lips.
"I personally think they seem moderate," said Mr. Tang overextendedly.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of urban viewers in China.
One city ordered new branches to have high school education.
The province of Guangdong has changed the silk-green uniforms to a slightly more attractive fashion.
Wuhan, in central China, restored his views on the armed forces: in one report, it was reported that in 2009 50 officials were unjustly engaged in a car with prostitutes and looked at the owners, when the underlying salesperson fell down and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city time of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose surgery as the main form.
Since 2003, he has been complementing his city police with 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their views, orientation and age.
The aim is to show the police also more nicer, the female side, in addition to the rough pages.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johannsson alone would have had trouble getting into the secret Chinese urban groups.
Argument would be critical for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police are allowed only to file a city complaint, to issue orders and other administrative orders.
But Chinese media often attract a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei knocked out an unsatisfied widow after using her cell phone to find out how they started in the case of protesting against the director.
In the last year, police training was conducted in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual, there was a different description of how to effectively harm customers without blood.
This year a subcontractor with melanoma in Shanghai got into a five-police robbery and suffered a left brain injury.
One video game full of violence that can be accessed on the Internet reflects Chinese police, as they attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan feared the government," China Daily, a national release, said in the late year after the next debate on tactics.
The paper was "very thorough cleaning."
The sceptics say that such access is not enough.
After injecting in October the interest of eight new women's police officers, the head of The Beijing Evening News asked whether women have real responsibilities or are only divorced.
The answer seems to be from both sides.
The period required women's representations from 18 to 22 years of age with a good position and "five faces in the right proportion."
Adaptations should be higher than average - then higher than 1.6 meters.
Service at the age of 26.
Officials claim that work is psychologically too expensive for women over 25 years.
"Your images are important," said one of the most famous police officers on Rednet.com, such as government websites.
"The candidates must first demonstrate external qualities which then identify other, including height, weight, face, etc."
Then comes a series of behaviors and "internal quality".
Women are like flowers, he said, and he added, "In addition to being pregnant, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the representative of the director of the district of the city, does not agree very much with this description.
But he pointed out that higher requirements are also common in China for other employment, and that is both of them.
It's just like a requirement on the face-to-face ratio.
Which means that the issue of good reflection is discussed between China.
Healthy touching or freezing is certainly not paid.
"He can't let a cruel or cruel man serve us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who has a look at Baoguang's place near the monastery, has 22 years of age, faces as a jabula and a very well-kept mouth.
It doesn't matter if the reason for her opinion could be seismic, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her partner, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says, "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They do not object to their limited performance, they say, because their career ambitions are more than just moving merchants into a street where they can perform their work.
Each morning, the group stands against more than ten traders running or on the streets and tries to sell as many towels and tofu as possible before they are escaped.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've already told you so many times!" said Ms. Xu, when the shopkeeper ran away, and in time he left his bike with a car with nozzles.
The police are describing their duties as more monotonous than the buyer.
"Every day goes basically the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in his volition marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that women's police have no power as their male rivals so that the goods can be enjoyed by the sellers.
They can only threaten to tell their male leaders the truth.
The trend is then to protect them from sudden public events of hostility to the official device that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan, gathered after spreading false reports of the murder of the seller by the police.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in night hours; 14 government vehicles were converted or burned.
Xindu's still escaped such violence.
But comfort can be guaranteed only by the hardship.
Just two blocks from the quiet town of Baoguang, where the police were watching this morning, more than 50 people were gathered on the street corner.
The police had a motorcycle that was repaired at the driver's place inside the store, as required by the rules.
The owner of the car could cry as he wanted.
15 minutes before the police, face-to-face, race-to-vehicle-to-vehicles, and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator of the team of men, remained behind, his white report turned around to hide his name.
Like women's cops, the coordinators are men over 40 years of age who have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain and freeze images.
"Sometimes we fight verbically."
"Sometimes we fight physics," said Mr. Li constantly.
"Mostly it's the public that starts with it."
The prosecutors won't charge Senator Ensign.
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge involving his affair with the former campaign counselor and his efforts to secure the lobby, informing the senator in the midst of the lawyer.
The decision concludes with the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, the Norwegian Republic, has taken by chance and has been considered as a potential Republican candidate for the president for 2012. His affair has reached national title and has damaged his career.
Mr. Ensigna's office said he was a decision that was followed almost a year after the survey, "surely happy".
The senator could still face disciplinary action in the Senate's ethical commission.
Lawyers Mr Ensign said that the Ministry of Justice " informed us that Senator Ensign would no longer have the purpose of examining and that it is not intended to bring charges against him in this regard."
The Ministry of Justice refused to disclose the case.
The decision was surprising to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal recruitment ban.
Discussions, e-mails and other documents published in New York Times in October 2009 indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to Mr. Hampton's and his wife, Cynthia's torture.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a volunteer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after Mr. Hampton was hired to hunt for them so many documents and conversations.
Since Hampton was a senior assistant to Mr Ensign, he was expelled from the law from the lobbying of his former employee or Senate for a year.
The ethical experts claim that the unusual arrangements of Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were prior to a friend's affair, appeared in dispute with the ban on lobbying.
Among the evidence that was published "there has been a finding that there is a clear case of the preparation of a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients who are investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawmakers, they said that the Ministry was careful about political complaints, after a large number of accidents, including the decision to stop the appeal against former Senator Ted Stevens during the prosecution of the State opposition.
Federal complainants "responsively hid weapons", said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of the Organisation for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a legal group that placed several difficulties against Mr Ensignov in this matter.
"This is based on the fact that the laws do not apply to high-level government officials," he added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Justice of Mr Ensign, delivered a speech on Monday that he was called by the State representative of the Ministry of Justice and then the second day, and told him that the Ministry had not been looking for any charges against his client.
The defence team, Mr Ensigna, cooperates with the complainant in an attempt to convince him that the senator, as his authority has packed in the middle statement, "has agreed with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments that he gave to the state officials.
"I am not pleased to look at the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month the Federal Voluntary Commission decided to suspend an examination of its own difficulties, in which the ethical group claims that the payment of Ensign Hampton’s parents exceeded the federal voluntary law by over $96 000.
The voluntary commission indicated that she had no evidence to prove that the money had nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was the company NV Energy, the main company of the German company that has long supported the senator.
An e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyist, leading Mr. Ensign - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "burned" the Ministry within about the item under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also participated in lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Norwegian client, Allegiant Air, and called for the Minister of Transport to attend the meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton's appointment at Lobbish.
When the report on the affair was first published last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and declined to his office, as in the order of the fourth Republican leader in Senat.
After a multi-month stay, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third holiday season in Senat.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the objective of examining the criminal proceedings of his speech, Mr. Jennifer Cooper stated that the senator hopes that the ethical commission will soon follow the Ministry of Justice and complete the investigation.
"Senator Ensign is pleased to continue in his hard work on behalf of the Norwegian people," she further said.
Crew of the Cheshire City Turns on Twitter
In a series of court cases, half of them wrote the same letter.
A minute later, they sent news of a terrible witness over Twitter.
At the end of the interview, more than 140,000 reports on Twitter have been filed by rape and forced children into a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the case was brought to trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced to the murder of three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, and had to be brought to an end with the execution of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already given the court an appeal with requests and arguments that the court would probably employ for years.
One of the most procrastinations is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the expanded use of Twitter by main reporters - created a "circuit atmosphere" and this expanded, unambiguous disclosure of information with exciting details then launched a report in a decision to influence the public opinion.
This claim could lead the judge to ask whether, with the introduction of new technologies, there is also a need for new rules in court.
"As I have experienced in this transformation, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the court scene affects the right of a fair process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief prosecutor of Mr. Hayese.
The Court of Justice of the European Court of Justice of the European Union has specifically rejected claims regarding the effect of the previous week and that the media have been "fully controlled" and that there is no evidence to indicate that the jury acted under public influence.
But it's probably not about the last word in this case.
Over the entire decade, the Court recognized that the reporting of notoriety cases could raise questions about the justice of the proceedings.
In the 1966 Supreme Court of the United States judgment, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard version Maxwell, the "carnival atmosphere" was agreed on in the case of Sheppard's version of Maxwell, in the case of the media.
Some have been convinced that this criminal act was inspired by television shows and film "Smoothing".
Some lawyers said that the appeal court, which examined Hayes' judgment about half a century later, could be surprised by the argument that there could be a need for new rules that determine how to communicate with the courts, which was unrepresentable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media" in the above-mentioned cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was done voluntarily.
Professor Donohue pointed out that some judges may be confused by the idea that restrictions on media communication can make the process more just.
The Twitter case is only one of many stressed lawyers Mr Hayes, who would be able to argue for years in order to carry out the judgment.
For example, the prosecutor claims that in the case of Mr Hayes, if Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of the potential rapporteurs by showing them a criminal picture of the threat.
Some of the rapporteurs indicated that they were frightened by the photograph of the victim that happened to Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The prosecutors claim that they also refuse the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a judge who was critical of the state officials and that his decision did not put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The cops weren't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They pointed out in the contest against the value raised last month that the case was dominated by a report in Connecticut and was discussed during a voluntary campaign of candidates to the Governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media continued to share emotions about the case.
"The day he bought the media, the cameras and the reporters in front of the court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something here that has not been seen in New Haven since, and one might also be about the whole country row."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the discussions, some journalists claimed that the unambiguous reporting of the report was more exciting than the reports later stated and that the court should, in their view, guide the field of other processes.
But some lawyers called for appeals to courts with commonly used arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are working on this right.
In their archives they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the matter of Dr. Sheppard's judgment, because of the broad process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "this is the Sheppard version of Maxwell 21st century."
Can a friendship overcome corruption?
After the campaign, which was remarkablely impressive and negative, this week in Washington revealed a small amount of hypocrisy.
Is it the first owner of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusion moment before the quick return to the party war in the capital?
The next meeting of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders did not produce any key statements on the main topics to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, there was a two-way debate on the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as the definition of their joint responsibilities, rather than the empty episode of the party's engagement.
The President's public meeting was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that the close presence over a period of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological spread that the members continue to divide.
And it's pretty difficult to claim that she started a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in the test period - they are harming each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the Volcano's tolerance to the renewed foreign war.
Therefore, it was also in-depth meeting and its subsequent assessment of participants carried out with minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republics are too wide and too deep to propose a rapid change of measurements that have been made here for the last two years.
Whether it's about the issue of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are far away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least quickly.
"It's no question whether the regulatory concerns have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The volleyballs blew the party's emotions, and then they ran away.
It's good."
In a number of issues, especially those that are to be held at the meetings, there is a small opportunity for republicans and democratics to find solutions.
Bush's tax cut at the end of the year and nobody thinks it's decent.
Both parties want to find a way to protect some or all, and that's either lasting or temporary.
Similarly, a likely compromise on the duty in unemployment is only because the Republicans cannot see how they support the reduction of taxes for the poor, while the unemployed refuse unemployment support.
After the evening meeting in the White House, there is already more optimism about possible agreements on these issues, together with ratification of the new arrest warrants.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily involve two political parties when the 112th Congress calls on the summer.
It's probably a bad time, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing things that have to be done, psychology will soon return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is significantly extended - to the fact that the hypocrisy is a true cooperation.
"I look at all events between the present and the year 2012 as a stage box when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
The Republican leaders are now facing a dangerous rise, knowing that they must act in accordance with their promises and that they must reduce government spending and break the new health care law.
These thresholds are clear in the initial responses to the recommendation on deficits, which include the reform of the tax legislation and the increase of some taxes, the increase in the age of debt and the reduction of expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken up one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to their opinion, have developed the pressure of deficit issues to the public programme in a way that cannot be ignored.
However, 14 votes are required in the 18th Member States to be able to present their plan as a formal recommendation and therefore to fight against the number that may be as close as possible.
The greatest contradiction is between the elected officials in the report, who suggest that in the case of financial issues, we have, at least today, small funds or wills for compromise.
Galston proposes two phases in the battle between the White House and the parliamentary republics.
The first year will begin in the form of foreign conflicts, when the Republic of Obama develops a solution to budgeting, taxation and health care, followed by greater foreign cooperation.
What's going to happen to the posse?
Public opinion.
There is plenty of evidence that despite the latest elections, most Americans still want to see two sides working together.
If it could be addressed to the pact as it was in 1995, then both parties would be very keen to monitor the public's reactions.
Anyone will risk lowering the votes, likely changing the course, and will seek compromise.
This can be a optimistic view of the matter.
Pageability and orientation are today greater than it has been in the mid-1990s and shows that there has been a greater ideological gap between the Obama and the parliamentary republics than in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
Similarly, both sides see 2010 as a front for the most important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the hypocrisy that appeared this week would blind many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common basis on issues that still divide them.
The published American document refers to Moscow as a corruption prevention
The city’s management is in the hands of the "kleptocratration" and it continues to cover some of the charges and charges on the way to Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia has issued reports from the U.S.
The police and the Federal Security Service have a high level of protection clauses that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Each type of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "the vertical authority" - takes himself when the money starts to climb over the hill.
A note sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrleh was published in the medium via WikiLeaks on their websites.
The record is based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at the time Yuri Luzhkov was still older and accused her of much corruption.
He was elected in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only follow the minimum changes in purity.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who had been the leading construction company for many years, continued to blame corruption, and won several complaints for such a charge.
In September he said to the Russian TV station when he was asked about the evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's a thing."
Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their company is corrupted, it will be shown to be voting.
It is not unusual to meet with such details in such a way as to be heard in a bilingual report, and it is also unlikely that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its association with criminal lives have led some to call it 'disfunctional' and confirm that the government works more like a cleavage than a government," says the report.
"Criminal elements are happy with the so-called 'krista' (a term from the world of crime and mafia which literally means 'strech' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of State Representatives, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analytics have identified and a traceable structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is on his own top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the Army are at second level."
"And finally at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in some areas, because some services are not provided in the city."
The report says that the FSB is taking money from the largest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "the owners of trade in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (more than organized criminal groups) because they have not only weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also protected by the law."
"That's why protection from criminal gangs is no longer in practice."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection alone can already have difficulties; and those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay enough fast are closed down under different orders.
He talked about the fight with corruption several times, but he admitted that he had only made little progress.
The Ambassad report speaks of men carrying suitcases, probably promoted to the Kremlin alone.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev has to rely on bureaucracy," said George Satarov, director of the Moscow research team in India in a recent conversation.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"There is no part of the political class, because there are no political classes in Russia anymore."
Without politics, without opposition, without power sharing, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem suggests that Russia's corruption is worldwide more than $300 billion annually.
The country is ranked at 154 in a recent study on the global perception of corruption of the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the country is ranked at least after the most corrupted).
The publication of the report of the American embassy that appeared in Moscow until late evenings certainly did not call upon the Russian government to intervene, even if it was only to the extent that the Moscow deficit could be blamed for Luzhkov, it could be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue in the matter of solving the problem.
In his speech to CNN with Larry Kingget, Putin told Putin that documents that WikiLeaks had published could be fragmented and responded to the statement that American diplomats call him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The whole issue is that it is about our mutual competence, which is an important factor of home policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't assume that this would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethical."
Veterans of Red Khmer are forced to match the past
In the struggle of the bright concrete school, with its broken and ol' walls, the director of the school of Anlong Veng High School, who set it up, the leader of the Rudý Khummer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves the Moca."
"He was a good leader and looked after his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
The leader in this remote country of the Rudí Khmero in the northwestern Cambodia, known as the "response" for his wealth during the Rudí Khammer government, remains popular, where he established hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers are still alive.
But this year, 12 years after the Rudi Khmer government was released, a long-term loyalty was also acquired in Anlong Vengo.
In depth, the victim was on the side of truth and reconciliation was allowed to meet publicly with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided a lecture explaining the history of the Red Khmer and their former soldiers for the first time.
And in June, the UN and Cambodia Court of Justice announced the first review of the former member of the Rudý Khammer, the trial of some leader, the notorically known violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, for 35 years in prison.
With any such progress, he grew a disquiet between the veterans of the Rudý Khammer in Anlong Veng, which is complicated by the efforts to re-enter Cambodia's society.
"Among the former Rudy Khmery is fear and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, the leading documentary centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life between Rudy Khmery was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the reign of the Rudý Khammer in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, 1.7 million people were treated or died of hunger, disease, or treatment.
When the Vietnamese attacked and raided the government of Paul Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and his soldiers were transferred to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they started a rebellion that lasted until the last stop in December 1998.
Paul Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary conducted a party war from their base in mountains and jungles in western Cambodia while Ta Mok cultivated a standing in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was known for its first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of Red Khmer warriors began to be transferred to the government that led up to the capitals Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was occupied by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangrek in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their prizes were no longer respected, most of the former Red Crescent warriors were attracted to the ordinary Cambodian foreign life and many of them are nostalgicly remembered during the famine.
Although several elite Rudj Khammers maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their positions remain weak, as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefits," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Justice, which leads the public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They're surrounded by utopian agro-ideologies of the regime."
"There were no regulations on the performance of the trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who entered Rudy Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he was appointed a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under Rudy Khmer was good," he said.
"This Mok has enjoyed it all."
"But now life is hard because we have to make sure everything is on our own."
The passing court of the Rudy Khmer also called for concern.
At the beginning of the next year, the court will examine Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Rudý Khammer.
The Court shall order the removal of the perpetrators and the persons responsible for the crime, but it has not been said whether it will continue in these four cases.
It was just a little to calm down the concerns in Anlong Venge.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, which was a regional leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Rudý Khammer at the end of the seventy years.
In 2007, researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia said that she had taken note of the construction of the Trapeang Thma building, a project that probably lost thousands of dedicated workers.
A recent couple evening Im Chaem returned from work to his wooden house on a spinal road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to rise and the walls appeared over the clear grass, Im Cham refused to talk about his past between Rudy Khmery.
If the court called her, she'd refuse to go.
"In Cambodia there is peace and stability," she said.
"If there's another criminal incident, there'll be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from the Red Khmer in 1978, also repeatedly warned that he would come to instability if the court was looking for further suspects, even though the experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury in it the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk said from the documentation center.
"Measure in Khmer dimensions means hiding broken bones," he said.
"Our duty is to give these broken bones together so that we can understand."
The Centre has issued the first teachers approved by the Government of Rudy Khmerich, with 75 pages and the name "The History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as an addendum to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Rudý Khammer.
Just like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Rudý Khammerch, and the city’s connections with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that a new school helps students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family refuses a lot of teachers and judges," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be judged."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and more difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, schools and courts are beginning to have an impact, he sent out further.
The Ruds of Khmer here still have a strong scar.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains, the road is extended by the river and is stretched by the detached plastic bags, which leads to the black-shadow, covered with a wooden beam.
The body of Paul Pota was buried here in a cave of pneumatics after his death in 1998.
Noom Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman at the corner of the train said he doesn't know much about the men who were buried there.
"But I have a strong spirit, many local people go here and pray to him," she said.
Noum Sothea was born and planned to visit the place of Paul Pota's rest, where she would bring every adult banana in hopes of bringing her happiness.
Belarus agrees that its weapons stocks appear on the basis of uranium
In a surprising victory in the campaign of President Obama on ensuring nuclear material throughout the world, the Belarusian government announced that their stocks of highly armed uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons, are being exposed.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the security summit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergey Martyn.
After years the U.S. government tried to convince Belarus to develop a highly popular uranus and seemed to have been born on the rocks of the river.
But the U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months, a number of armed operations had been carried out with Belarus in order to remove 187 free weapons on the basis of uranium from the Belarusian research device.
This provided a basis for the medium-term agreement to remove the remaining material - about 500 pounds, according to the official who spoke under the terms of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement showed itself to be one of the most important results of the 47th National Summit on Nuclear Safety in the depth at which Belarus was scheduled.
And it was obviously good here to ensure that the former Soviet Republic was invited to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place on the summit on nuclear safety 2012."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Lugono, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group that supports nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement a "great, important step" from Belarus.
Both promised in Prague in April 2009 that they would secure all sensitive nuclear material throughout the world for four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to rid themselves of all their resources of a highly prized uranium.
Belarus will be seven.
A dozen countries have done so for George W. Bush's administration.
In the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukašenko announced that his people would never take their uranus.
"We have a highly refined uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for weapons and less refined uranium," said Lukašenko.
"It's our comedy... we're not going to make a spy bomb and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, a few months ago Belarus joined the United States and expressed its interest in reaching an agreement.
The first undertaking to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily detected, the officials announced.
He was put on a special train which traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian system for coordination and liquidation, the officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and a plane was carried out, the officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of which contributed to the Belarusian research system a less popular uranium that is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"All was well coordinated and conducted on the basis of trust", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bienevski, the Director of the Energy Ministry working for Global Thread Reduction.
James Martin Center for the Study on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons This year suggested that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the manufacture of weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint declaration, force its stocks to be removed by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been under attack throughout the year, especially because of the cruel repression of human rights by Lukašenka.
But the average statement indicates the possibility of a progressive silence.
"We see progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that further respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its citizens," he said.
The Spanish government has not done anything since the CIA's planes.
The Spanish Government has not done any damages to the CIA's flights carried over to the Taliban and members of Al-Qaida to Guantánamo via the Spanish territory, as expressed in their telegram of the United States Ambassador to Madrid.
This is illustrated by the documents provided by the Wikileaks denik El País, where he also writes that the former prime minister, María Teresa Fernández de la Vego, requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "may show that he has the appropriate consideration of the other flights flying Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, after a communication from the Council of Europe, in which thousands of States, including Spain, had been charged with human rights violations, a meeting was held between U.S. High Representative Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vego.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's communication "swifted the Zapater's government from the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vegova pointed out that Spain has no problem with the years of secret services across its territory.
"They just want to be informed", so they don't be "sustained intruder," Aguirre reports in one of the documents.
Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the American public that the Spanish government "wanted to give this concern as much as possible, but because it was in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed Velvyslanect that in his case, it was not intended to block the court's initiative to request the withdrawal of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence for CIA years.
"This information does not contain any incriminating material or any sensitive information," explained Velvieslanetti after talking with the prosecutor.
However, the United States expressed more concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the withdrawal of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent scholars will be complicated by our efforts to resolve this case indiscriminately between governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the U.S. referendum, and Minister Alfreda Péreze Rubalcaby, the speaker said that "even though the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they would expect," he had already instructed his colleagues, "to avoid perceived comments with a view to reducing tension".
The speaker also expresses his concern about the political party of Partido Popular (PP; Czech Lidová page - see also) in this regard.
"And through its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Party of Popular will not hesitate to use any indications that Zapatero's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the United States union, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if it could have negative consequences for the government of the United States," he notes.

When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week to Palmy.
However, it is clear from the content of her communication that the relationship was broken.
In March 2008, he was on his own at Menorce, and he wrote, "Alberto's someone angry that I went to work."
"When I told him that, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with a little day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about the text message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address I'm sending to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave my mother with a child, I'll take him when I get back," she says.
in May she says about her return to her apartment: "I'll go there this week, but I'll stay until 19, because I have to go to work to avoid this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, we'll take our son to ourselves.
"It will be with someone to be with, then with me, and never again in life will I leave him with someone other than my mother," mistakenly intended in view of her bad relationship.
There's another contribution here in June.
When this report is published, it is assumed that the child who was born on the island of the first day of this month and was probably killed 10 is already dead.
"Cesar is calm on the one hand, but not on the other."
"He's on one side with me and he likes it here, but on the other hand he goes almost every day to school."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to the summer school, and I'll save some money for the horse."
Seventy-seven-year-olds.
"A big piece of Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I didn't know what video on the e-mail, see how he likes it, he's meeting with me, sex is needed."
The third report says, "The boy's fine, he's going to the summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one news about Victor, the current partners, "he's giving me money."
On the Internet, Moniques are contributing to the bloated animes and mania.
She even had her own on MySpace, now audited where she was going to say "Muki ex prison".
"Teror by the gallon (motto) "
The last man with whom she lived, a soldier, expresses his sorrow and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a free mother.
Last night, Monica entered the provincial court in Palma, where she came from the main centre of Menorce.
The prosecutor, Carlos Maceda, pointed out that the suspect doesn't remember how everything happened and that "she didn't have to hurt a little bit."
Previously, she admitted that César had been in the van and had put his body in the kitchen.
The defense officer and the prosecutor are asking for a psychiatric examination.
People would get 4 cross-sections in Snow and PSC (Socialist side of Catalánska - p.m.) would lose 9 orders
with the results of 28 November, the PP party could have the main word on the workshops in Lérida, Tarragon and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes taken and the number of Members tested during recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Lid's side of the Catalan – see also) already has an idea of the general elections, whether it will ever occur or never, its views are more positive than the number of votes in the national elections, since it is usually one such turn for Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in general, while in 2006 the number was only 316,222.
Last week, PPC (Lid side of Catalan) received 384.091 votes.
If this trend is maintained, supported by the transmission of votes from PSC and the loyality of PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if the end of the general election was to be completed, PPC could, in November, acquire 12 Members to the remaining 8, page CIU (Convergence and Union, Czech Trade and Union) would also receive 4 mandates (now having 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 circles (not having 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalan has a fundamental meaning for PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis, the ERA (Levic Republican side of Catalanska - no.) would have lost one delegation - now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalan - No.) would still have one mandate, if any, another one.
However, according to the voluntary calendar, the most recent delivery will end in May 2011, where people can also have an impact on the end of the rule of socialists in the four main provincial cities and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the most planned budget appropriations of EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree with the possibility that PSC could lose its offices in Barcelona, Tarragon, Léride and Geron, where socialists would not have received most and not be able to turn to their traditional connections, the ERA and ICV parties.
In view of the Republican debate, it would not be possible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona Presidency - as it is necessary to obtain at least 5% votes.
The PP side increased the number of votes won in four main cities and could have a decisive impact on Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragon.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the operation in Tarragon, where they jointly ruled with the PP prior to the current age, Joseph Félix Balleteros.
In Léride, the PP received only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose elderly Angel Ross had very good relations with Marian Rajoye - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also obtained other significant workshops such as Badalon, Casteldalels or Reus.
At the present time, PP is represented at 34 workshops in Catalan and would like to create candidates as many cities as possible.
The Catalan bunk provided thousands of passports to Al-Qaida organisation
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian who were detained by the General Information Commission in Barcelona, created a geo-disciplinary building in Thailand, which included travel passports to various Al-Qaida groups, including "Tygri Freedom of Tamil Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the second group named was the author of an interview in Bombaji, during which 106 persons died in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior aims to investigate this concern with a great deal to ensure that the "operation of Campai" helps to weaken Al-Qaida's international equipment and "restrict its operational capacity".
Investigators suggest that during two years when it was active in Catalan, it was possible to send thousands of travel passports to Thailand, where they were distributed and then provided with groups that created the criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaida organization so that their "wars" could travel freely across borders in Europe and other western countries.
This broken bridge was not the only active one that had the Jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units in addition to the Thai services have also participated in these investigations, and it cannot therefore be ruled out that in the following days, it will not enter other European countries into similar steps, as it was last night in Barcelona.
In relation to this operation (when Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Aguambiade) developed further in Thailand, where Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikallaya Kybumrung were employed.
It was just those men who led the Bangkok bunker in Spain and elsewhere in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was abolished in 2009, was particularly stolen by tourists who met the demands of Islamists.
This means that documents had to be for men between 25 and 45 years of age, had to be paid for several years and had to be without a well-known visa.
The investigation documents indicate that there are no facts yet known that would be linked to the attacks by Catalanca in Bombay, despite the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the group that took the passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it is clear that a few days before this attack, about $1,000 was sent from the Catalan transfer agency, which was "inserted" to purchase a ticket to mobile phones, which later were used by members of the "command", which killed 106 people.
The police have already taken a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) asks for Mass to terminate the Fiscal Agreement
The President of the PPC (Lidova side of Catalánska) Alicia Sánchez-Camachova had an opportunity yesterday to present his terms and conditions personally to Arturo Masov, for which he was willing to support his presentation to the President of the Generalitat; these conditions were consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority was economic recovery and risk management as an economic agreement which the leaders of the nationalists wanted to propose during their mandate.
The president of the Catalan people was sent to the meeting with Arthur Mass with 18 parliamentary crises held in the elections last week, which was more than satisfactory to obtain permission, so the CIU candidate needs at least one of the formations of the opposition to hold a vote on his arrival at the office.
As far as possible with the PP, the future alliances that nationalists would like to maintain in the Snow will come to an end with the general will, but the discussions that will lead in these days with the rest of the political leaders are not in the Catalan spirit.
With regard to the President of the PP, in order to obtain her support for the implementation of the function, "it will have to end with all the dedicated and freed events", as well as with the economic agreement - similar to the one that the leader of the CIU even wanted to vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to speed up the excessive political equipment of self-government and reduce parental and donor taxes.
Details about Mas's entry into function will be left under PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
The mass had already met with Joaquin Nadala (PSC), who had promised a firm opposition, Joan Herrerou (ICV) and today with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Citadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidariat Catalana).
The manager of the geriatric device ensures that there has been no death due to "a failure of the measure"
Olot's exhibitions do not show that their baker killed more than 11 customers
The management of the Geriatric Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to alleviate the damage caused by the criminal behaviour of Joan Villy Dilmé, a pacifist, who, in the meantime, was employed here, killed at least one hundred seniors who cared for.
The director of this house for seniors Joan Sala delivered to the lawyer of the facility, Joan Canady, and announced that "the acceptance of the house of La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the guilty" responsible for the murder, as well as "the law and responsibility compel us to give up this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to a good name, which can be endured by this institution because of the fact that there has not yet been criminal fishing activities, the great threat to the house of La Caritat now poses the requirements for severe damage already being calculated by legal representatives of the rest of the family.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime was already committed in August 2009 and that he has not been able to kill since then
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight clients at home for seniors with the suspicion that in many cases no dead doctor personally visited, even though, in view of the age and the poor condition of the patients, everything appeared on the phone.
La Caritat, through his director, strongly rejected this nationality yesterday and stressed that "the lack of action could not be in any case due to what happened".
Legal representative La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party, apart from its own accused, would be allowed to make a mistake".
The man now quoted as "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 murders yesterday and confirmed that the first crime was allowed on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later killed another old man.
In this case, death caused too much insulin dose, unlike the first case, when using the mixture of comforting tablets.
Director La Caritat indicated that it is difficult to control staff access to medications.
The insulin and coke of sedatives were likely in six cases of nine cases used by this sedative to cause the patients to die in their efforts to relieve their suffering.
However, the first analysis that is currently being carried out in the laboratory should show if Vila was unable and actually looking for his first victim less cruel death or killed by the use of the dog, as he admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat they do not believe in medical claims and they do not conclude that the number of murderers can be higher than the one he admitted to, and justify their behavior in different versions given by the Vila court with the knowledge that he must change his conduct when it appeared that he killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be just available to make the whole scope of this concern clear.
European Central Bank of Threats
Investors responded yesterday morning to the threat of the President of the European Central Bank Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The regional differences were closed by force and the shares of the European bank amounted to more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro is just above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-liquid market, which, although it is due to decline, is done - but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
Investors will stay for a while before they lose their concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to take back the liquidity peace today, and tomorrow we will have to call for a quarter of a year.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy a State debt for the ineffectiveness and elimination of all the excessive liquidity measures within a period of time and to leave unlimited access only within one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that liquidity peace will presuppose "minimumly to the March" and will receive a three-month tender with unlimited access to the end of this quarter so that they can guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue to buy debt in their programme and that they will even announce its intensity.
If it is not fully expected, it will create a new market reaction from yesterday, and if they continue to be blind in gaining the measure of liquidity, God is with us!
The same was at the meeting in April, where they claimed that they did not even consider buying long-term securities, and came to the market collapse - tomorrow history could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be reliable and sustainable.
In May, it announced the Pancer's strike in the afternoon and announced in the middle that it had already captured many of them, which led to further market distortions.
Yesterday's invitation to change for a year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of previous prices.
As the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting the market change in demand, which came after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, figures were published representing losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent a total of 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, with the possibility of becoming private capital, otherwise being settled.
Although Ireland has no credibility, since the crisis did not leave stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable and help to reduce insecurity within the framework of the aid plan.
However, the next afternoon, the government will need to gain the approval of the new budget by Parliament and there will still be insufficient support, so the government remains uncertain in Ireland.
Angela Merkel measured the tone of her speech in order to release the pressure in the face of the next EU summit of December 14, on which we need to come to a political compromise that would show that we are the Union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner while the others would prefer Beethoven's Board to be happy.
In Spain yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatization, employment recovery measures - to other investors it sounds like the four-year period from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Tricheta and Zapatera explains why the Spanish bourgeois has grown by 4.5%, so twice as other European bears.
Unlike us, the government’s reaction and the Spanish National Banks were quick and convincing - we are suffering from the effects of surprise.
Today, we have a key bid for a three-year period that will result in the effect of Trichet, for which we hope there will be a great demand that will help to raise doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Requesting a rescue plan would be for Spain's suicide.
They would give us what we don't need - in El Tesora there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in the market - further high rates and market access would close our days.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to continue to apply Caesar's women's strategies - "not only to be it, but also to feel it."
We can do it.
The President of the Eulen Group will attack Vega Sicilia's company with his children
Bours in the open conflict in the family of Álvarez, owned by Eulen and El Enebro, are not involved.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after what he called "the whole unknown", the legal meeting of El Enebro's company scheduled for 16 this month and the required five of his seven offspring, on which they should try to exploit their majority and strengthen themselves with the help of the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicily.
David Álvarez and his son Jesús David and María José are taking over a legal group for the new chapter of their dispute on the governance of the part of society.
The founder of the largest maintenance of business services is not likely to be willing to take part in his debate on the membership of the ruling El Enebro Group.
of its Administrative Committee, five of its seven descendants were appointed as alternates during the meeting of the shareholders on 18 January of this year and their object is entered in the Trade Register.
The hearing of the El Enebro group scheduled for the sixteenth month, which was approved by the Office of the Trade Court No. 2 in Madrid, resumed the funeral in the Lone family of Álvarez.
The appeal to the Court is until the dispute is resolved by the only legal means which guarantees the Commission's vote.
The last step of Juana Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elviry of the Álvarez Mezquirizovés is considered by David Álvarez to be "a reliable means of his five children serving by the Court of Justice and a clear legal basis for strengthening and improving the 18th meeting, which was totally non-payment".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack of this association as a "all-inclusive".
Self-protagonists, who are discrepancies, have already tried without success to appeal to the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned by other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, manages seven descendants of David Álvareze 100% capital.
However, according to the family protocols, the Group's founder requires the right to use 51% of the capital.
This concern is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when the case is referred to in the case of a court attack. The date of the infringement has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software proposes perfection in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered Formula 1 series in 2004, his story in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one had taken too seriously the possibility of this new future team, and despite the recent trend, all of them were on the troumf Ferrari Fernando Alons.
Before we want to lower the horsepower of the champion, German Sebastian Vettella, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, in Formula 1 the legend was born in the world - a "silent weapon", by Siemens, which the internationalist Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to do so as a winning team.
In fact, it is an effective software that has been introduced by the German company to the market in 2007 for the purposes of a very distant car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to propose assembly lines in production camps around the world, in energy sports and for high precision devices.
Its objective is to reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, which can be avoided by excessive mistakes and expenses.
The PLM facilitated the development of Canon photo equipment, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most popular commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, the leading industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this software has enabled Red Bull team to perform "in a few hours, in almost real time" modification and perfectionation that are otherwise detected during the race and test.
Russwurm says that in 1992, there were about 10 technicians who were able to operate at a maximum of three or four perfectings over a period of one period.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young qualified professionals are working on an efficient information technology that analyzes and proposes any type of vehicle modification.
The director of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all the elements of the Red Bull race vehicles with the exception of the engine that is fully compatible with Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be transferred from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser production systems and highly technologically advanced motors.
The only limit for this technical facility is the amount of $40 million representing a maximum of which can be issued by each Formula 1 team for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a 50 km radius of London's race of spy technology that serves to propose and manufacture his own race vehicles.
It's about two buildings where I'm restricted to access, especially for journalists.
Everything that's played here is considered "great secret."
The list of participants in this project reads 580 persons including two pilots - the Vettel and Mark Webber.
Herdino Red Bull is in Formula 1 without any doubt a fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
Under the unmeaning technological means that the brand of energy drinks has introduced into their participation in sports circles, other protagonists whose assistance is invaluable are not known.
The chief of manufacturing technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in research and development of vehicles contributed to 50% victory and the rest was the envy of drivers.
At present, this measure has changed and technology stands for 85% success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that the vetter or Webber will never be replaced by accounting technology because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP organises 20 own trades in cooperation with local distributors during two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with his trading partner, Pont Reyes, opened his first exclusive sale in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first from the network of 20 trades of ranges 80 to 100 m2, which this international company plans to open in Spain for the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing shops such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte English.
The Vice-President of the Spanish HP Helena Herrero, for example, introduced a new stop shop at the Barcelona Gran Vía, which belongs to Pont Reyes, where HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has reached a plan to set up 200 sales sites in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish trades.
The first sales were opened last week in Bucharest, Romania, and in Belgrade, Serbia, and the trade in Barcelona is then the third.
Herrero didn't want to reveal where other sales would be opened, yet she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrero, which also runs the staff systems of the HP, assured that the openness of trade philosophy will remain the same - using local distributors who have sector experience and expertise.
The North American company here is working with an exclusive design of equipment sold (with products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also responsible for the insurance of trade personnel.
Helena Herrero said it would be a matter of franchising, and stressed that the exclusive network has been sold to "improve the customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises in the purchase, service, sales service and even the coast".
Trade in Barcelona is part of a worldwide pilot pioneer programme designed to address any problems with computer devices in the garage.
The online service is offered with a technical centre in Maastricht (Nissoland).
"So we'll be able to solve problems within 10 minutes, which otherwise may last for two days."
"This system is specially designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contract service of technical assistance," Helena Herrer pointed out yesterday.
Sababell concludes that "crazy" for three years to his competitors millions of customers
More optimistic than any other chief, a member of the Bank Bank Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a financial burden to the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
It is still calculated by reducing the rates that will be tried to compensate for the decline in bank payments and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to be able to get millions of private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years and the power to survive under difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to living without the need to turn to public aid in the FROB, to get a market share of millions of new private customers - 70,000 respectively, if those who might leave the bank - since until now, the constitution was more likely to attract small and medium-sized businesses and large businesses than small customers.
This year the bank has already received 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Its share in the market makes it more than 10% of its private customers.
Another of the fundamental ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or it can also be said that it is likely to reduce the costs that the bank will show when the results are presented for the period.
There are no banking institutions currently considering setting goals and publishing them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell concluded his program of Optim, established four years ago, although originally in three years, but the situation on the market required enlargement for another period.
Clients who leave the trailer will be their main target group.
At a meeting organized by the APIE, Guardiola continued that 2011 will be "hard and very important".
It is thought that the road from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, for two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector.
And while he believes that the passive war - which reduces the margins - results in the price of the risk that banks and customers pay for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity, he has already moved to the prices of loans that compensate for the reduction of the margin.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will represent a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the cage yet, but the differences are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued its networks on Thursday order to reduce long-term loans and raise prices of differences - see CincoDías on 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the trend in banking "there is no reduction of provision", but here is a "competitive framework".
The Sabadell Bank's strategic plan is based on organic growth, while the group does not normally exclude corporate operations.
It does not guarantee itself that in Spain, "they will demand greater sizes."
"The next year won't stay on the stone stone," he said.
It asserts that capital needs are "reduced properly" and does not exclude some Spanish institutions from entering the red numbers.
And it shows that the FROB can place funds on the market before new capital measures.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it continues to pose a serious problem for some banks to predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It means that they cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to obtain short-term funding through the repo rate, which reduces the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of fuses by-products
The Director-General of the CECA refused yesterday that another wave of wind would be set up and continued at the speed with which the reorganisation of the sector was carried out.
When the Spanish co-operation process was launched, several institutions were assured that this first phase was non-participating and waiting for a second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederal Association (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday announced that a new wave of these operations should be launched.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, incorporated Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as second round, what is happening is the contracts."
"The majority is fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 constitutions, we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already ready and protected by the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well in this regard," the manager noted.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of the leading and executive officials of Aragon - see Minutes) Olavarrieta said that the concentration process is being carried out "as soon as possible and we must be very satisfied as it is shown in payments that have now, not now, appeared in business plans with the Spanish National Bank," he highlighted.
"To move from 45 partners with an average active amount of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be greater and thus more consistent with the Basel Treaty," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are many happy opinions about the slow process", which indicate "the lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to remind us that we must be in the end of the year".
General Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta said last night that Spain has the most pressing financial system throughout Europe and "probably" and in the world, and those who doubt it have joined in "insufficient knowledge".
The director pointed out that in the current prevailing economic situation, we can "be calm" with regard to financial institutions and partners and the system which has managed "very important" concentration process and which continues to "as fast as possible".
He also recalled that Spain’s banking was very good at the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Veterans and red German lines
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but set conditions for the Union as a whole.
The pressure on the thirds has tested two government responses.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed a new adaptation measure, from a reduction in taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, by regulation of private mediation agencies or a reduction of EUR 426 for non-employed persons, to 49% of AENA (Spain Airports and air traffic management - see recitals 30%), the airport manager Barajas and El Prat.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, joined the critics at the address of Chancellor Angely Merkel because of her responsibility for resolving the current crisis.
How do they interpret these movements?
It was said that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
Rather, it is another item in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which leads to the idea of keeping old traditions that hold much of the rest of the members.
Faces in the face of European opposition in Germany begin to speculate about three possible routes from the crisis.
The first of these represents a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany, but also Rakousko or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the mine area.
The second is to return to March - although it can now be seen as a scif, this version has extensive public support, which is close to 50% of the population.
The third option is that, according to the German proposals, the processing of the euro with greater macroeconomic vision, the budgetary presence, the trials for the state, the possible reimbursement of payments for some of them, and the expansion of possible costs for regulation in the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so now there is no space for drawings.
Firstly, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission undertook deficits in 2009 the German Government had launched a constitutional reform in order to prevent them from leaving in 2016.
This was the first sign of a dispute between what Germany considered to be the right (fiscal presence plans and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners did, including France.
The company showed this Central European country when Merkel’s disease challenged the decision on Greece’s rescue.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the preservation of Greece.
Finally, in recent October, Merkel again expressed his clear view when he called for the reform of the European Union's agreements so that it would be possible to save some Member State and at the same time to have a private trust obligation not to have part of the costs.
This statement was interpreted as anti-European as it accelerated the Irish crisis and all the others.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat moderate manner, was approved and we should follow the Union reform process, which should allow this measure from 2013.
The Germans crossed a red line that was not suitable for crossing.
And it informs us that, even though it is now necessary to take measures that are obviously not in agreement, this date will end with the old functioning of the euro.
The year 2013 will represent the emergence of a new currency zone in which Member States are severely penalized and may have to report payments, and the private sector will also have to pay some of the costs.
Germany points out that we need to make a direct step towards growth by increasing support and investment, moderate consumption, productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on search and construction, with huge margins in the payment balance, which the governments in the years to come in Spain are simply not able to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not only about the recovery of public deficit by 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions, we might be able to make a mistake on our own.
I hope these contemporary turbulence will bring more relief.
And that we're using the opportunities that they give us for the year 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his two statements (reforms linked to meeting large companies from the past Saturdays and earlier announcements of new measures) indicate that, through criticism to Merche's address, he opened the way of thinking that things should be done.
However, the red line that Germany has drawn is here, and it doesn't seem to want to go with her.
And from the possibilities you can consider, the release of the euro area can't completely force the serious countries out of existence.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and rules
Finnty, who spoke of Alonso and Ramos in an agreement with Ajaxe, showed a deep desire never to avoid punishment.
It was thought that the release of two players from Real Madrid (Xabiho Alons and Sergia Ramose) in the League of Masters against Ajaxu on November 23 resulted in the destruction of the sea incoherence of whether this is or not a non-portable behaviour and whether UEFA should not be represented by both football players.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which had their team clearly won) the names of the players lost the time they had to play in order to test the judge, and this showed them another yellow card.
In this way both players will be fully punished in the following attacks against Auxerre - while Real Madrid will end in its group in the head - and they will be able, free of charge, to proceed to another phase.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary commission sentenced coach José Mourin to two fines and convicted players received a monetary sentence.
The production of yellow cards under similar conditions is no new practice, although it is mostly common in the photoballs.
It's so wide that it's part of the etos of the photoball, so the rules that are not written on the grid, but they're following.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that her participant was a Real Madrid team (which, in his imaginative softness and feeling, which had already been attributed to the similar acts of his players), and, as it seems, also thanks to the dramatization of Maurinhem, which thus adds to his long history of comedian and procurator of another episode.
In any case, the debate concerns whether this type of conduct which is not expressly prohibited is contrary to the principles of sport, and whether it comes to law enforcement; the effect of the action respecting the rules of sport, which it seems, is trying to cover.
It's said what kind of damage this behavior causes a sports spirit.
One of the appropriate sports behaviour is the physical incompatibility of players who were not injured in these cases, who did not come to a violent game.
Another of these appropriate features of the pure game is to avoid the fact that the players have been against the opposite team of benefits - which is not here either.
So the paradox of the act of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not come to what we normally characterise as a law or law enforcement, did not come to a hidden violation of rules in order to avoid sanctions, although this behavior should be the most appropriate to the purpose of punishment.
They're waiting and they're happy to be punished.
The next question, however, is what the benefits will be for the offenders from their deliberate transition.
Here it is necessary to note that the opposition does not reach an uneven position, and that no progress is achieved in the current package, because the obvious consequence is that the team will have fewer players alone.
And it's not even a useful strategy in another game, because the club won't be able to count with these players.
Clearly, the outcome is that players will start another phase of the League of Masters without a card that could threaten their participation in future events.
However, there is a long-term benefit and a certain degree of uncertainty, so first of all, it can be eliminated by the team, and in spite of this encounter, the players of the punishment will be lifted, and they will pass into the second car, where there is one card less than in the first round.
So as the car goes on, it won't be quite clear if it's a profit.
Briefly and well, these negotiations are not against the sports spirit, which is part of a strategic decision that will allow maximum benefits under the rules.
In the case where we live here, players should not have to avoid being punished (which would have been a clear case of breaking rules), they would rather have chosen when it was given to him.
They have made strategic decisions without avoiding or avoiding punishment.
Although there is no limit between the depth and the behaviour of the rules, I believe that in this case there was a single degree of depth.
It seems to me that the police are responsible for two reasons: for two self-reliances and for the way in which the transmission of instructions has been carried out to be carried out since they were conducted.
The damage to the sports principles of these shares is not as ethical as aesthetic.
War offering for dinners in Barcelona
The tenth calendar concentrates the year's holiday reserved for December 16th and December 17.
Soon, there will be a celebration of hired single workers who want to lose between 20 and 30 euros.
Just like the Turkish med or lottery, the coming Sunday comes again, the premixtures that continue to be the oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but the crisis has left them in the struggle to get customers down to prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, they agree with the questions of entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
In order to complete the complexity of the numbers, he concentrated this year's calendar (when the Saturday day came on Friday), the application for a week from 13 December, resulting in a daily booking by the team (16 and 17), while there was hardly any operation in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the years began, there are many companies that have broken down the collective evenings for accounting reasons.
In order not to abandon traditions, many employees pay rent on their own party dinners.
Regardless of the situation, many require prices at the limit of pregnancy, says the president of the Restaurant Association Gremi de Restoración de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the restaurant's patronage shall not be considered at this time to predict what the celebration of this month will be.
"People think it's a good idea before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but when it comes to price issues, they're careful," he adds.
Trades are going well for those who offer quality and good service at a affordable price, says and recalls that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down and most customers want to lose around 25 euros now.
The survey in various devices shows that the greatest effort of the reservation request is on evening 17 December.
The Soteras Group reports a real booking boom on this Friday, while most of the requirements are for discounts up to 30 euros, which have prompted the offer menu, whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another significant company, Andylana, which has read 16 devices in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), has brought the speciality of the annual calendar with more time reservations and since the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu from which everyone should choose is moving from 19.95 to 30 euros," they say.
In the AN Group, which consists of El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, there remain optimistic after the second half of the profits increase and have relatively solid views on the Christmas market.
The sources of this company point out that the 18th December will also be fulfilled on the day of the premise between friends.
To their six group menu, they added the menu of the evening, starting at 30 euros or more, as they recorded in comparison with the year of Monday, the customer's trend to lose 10% more than for other items such as coffee (Spain’s forest wine - after the change).
They also noted that there are already companies that call their employees again and that the size of the group seems to be something bigger.
Vice-President of the Fecasarm company (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Free Time Centre in Barcelona) Henri Goma believes that she begins to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings "lived", even though customers "record to maximum".
He didn't even pay for this wedding party. He's paid for it.
Pakistan's nuclear programme has produced a great disillusion in the USA
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "more rapid than any other country".
The Wikileaks documents confirm the relationship between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States of Pakistan and the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by the Wikileaks portal, confirms the extraordinary discomfort that wakes up a Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
According to the clear and significant details that offer the content of the communication and the opinion of representatives of the North American diplomat in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states, in terms of nuclear security, instead of raising, "is on the way," and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that its weapons are not mounted, but they are consistent with the work to reduce their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons why Washington is involved.
This calculates in Pakistan's Anne W. Patterson in a report before visiting the National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear devices to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the reported breakdown of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The increase in the number of persons associated with nuclear arsenals and the program of controlled shootings is not only observed in the United States but also in Russia, as a growing and representative reason to be on guard.
"Pakistan had to hire a staff with a strong religious faith in order to protect nuclear devices; given the fall in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or targeted shooting programmes," said expert Jurij Korelov from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at their meetings with their U.S. colleagues.
The largest news document published by the server Julian Assange is the further downturn between the United States and Pakistan in terms of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and an increase in the rate of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Deceptively issued by the ambassador in the spring, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "Transparence does not often exist; aid offers remain unresponsible or are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national news service worker for South Asia, notes that "and through the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other state in the world."
St. Petersson also asks Washington that during his visit to General Ashfaq Kayani's army chief, "they have well explained," that "the Pakistani army must end with the silent support of the terrorist groups."
She's at the Wikileaks boss.
Both appoint a high-ranked worker responsible for the fight against terrorism in order to avoid new offenders.
Interpol presents a "green challenge" with the aim of investigating and determining where Assange could be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange are creating a complex labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain facts.
Interpol announced an "external challenge" yesterday, i.e. a series of notes, to "localization and monitoring of movement" Assange.
However, there is no classical order for detention.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates to November 20.
And there is nothing more than four million diplomatic documents to do with the last ultimatum, even with accusations of sexual abuse that Australia faces in Sweden.
According to this, the legal representative of the company Wikileaks Mark Stephens assures us that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was November 20th, when the International Police Council, sitting in the French Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, did not disclose it until yesterday when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions for identification or location of Assangoo "with the aim of getting on and leaving it temporarily."
Although Interpol is unable to arrange detention of persons affected by the Red Challenge, many Member States, as the organisations have explained, consider such a number of notes to be available for arrest - it must be ensured by the national police component - especially in cases where States have a mutual agreement on the extradition of detainees, such as Sweden and England, where Assange would likely be found.
This step angered Asging's lawyers who had published the texts yesterday that announced that nine-year-old Wikileaks was willing to answer the questions of Swedish authorities using the video conference.
They also recall that Asggen requested and subsequently obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutors of his case, which compares with the legendary Lavlovic Beriju, chief of Stalin's security.
"This is a hom and not a legal trace," he writes.
While the whole world is looking for her - and his mother from Australia boasts the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, in Germany.
in the afternoon, he provided Skype with an unknown interview with the Time newspaper chief - in this interview he asked the Foreign Minister of the United States to resign Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for the U.S. diplomats' order to carry out spies in the UN and violate international agreements signed by the United States, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the White House printer Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for dementia as "a funny and absurd."
"I'm not quite sure why we should be interested in the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he told CNN.
The alone Obama trusted a highly appointed employee responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusella Traverse, in order to interfere with other authors of documents.
The aim of the speaker, Baracka, is to stop adding Assange to the importance of contrasting the views of conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be the chairman of the National Security Committee in the Lower Room, asked the Foreign Ministry to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among the terrorist organization, "in order to attract and attract anyone who would financially assist them or otherwise provide assistance".
Tom Flaangan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's adviser, who announced that Assange should be "killed", and then he had to call.
"We should both print a reward or use a free plane or something like that."
Whoever didn't talk, Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former Governor of Arkansas and a potential candidate for president.
"Whoever is in the government, whoever is responsible for the theft of information, has allowed the court and any other penalty than the correction would be too peaceful," declared at Fox Station
Puigcercós is looking for "floating" in the ERC.
The Republican Leader will allow a secret vote to be held on its behalf.
Huguet proposes more plural execution and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós has apparently found a recipe to fight a few internal revolutions in the ERA series (Levikova Republican side of Catalánska - p.m.), which is unprecedented in the loss of 11 Members and half votes.
The president of the party is aware that his gesture regarding demissions seems insufficient to former leader Josep Lluíse Caroda-Roviry, and he also knows that the impact of this sector is already as weak as his own leader, and that he cannot make it as much of his own age as other missing losses.
Therefore, the leader of Levice will try to get new criticisms through the freezing, which will help him turn to the popular elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the General Committee would be able to speak in secret to his detention.
With the vocal cords, I'll never raise my hands.
If Carodians want to vote before the President, they will be able to do so without fear of the defence measures.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid discrimination and discrimination against his own people.
In several discussions, he claimed that he would not be considered a confirmed half-vote and one-on-one, but added, without making it clear that he would also not have a good result "by bulharska".
The staff of the Caroda require more than they can afford - which they consider to be a gesture that has no bearing, since Puigcercós has the power to take over the sessions of the greatest body.
But given that they don't have enough to be able to make a mission, they'll try to remember an executive plan from now on to spring.
For this reason, they are expected to participate in the preparation of a strategic reorientation document, which may lead to the vote of the National Council on 18 days a month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the commitment to move the convention already in late 2011.
The ERC leader stated that "multilinguality" damages stability, and that his aim is to once and for all, the organization is able to carry its spinal cord behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be a distinctive article signed by the current consultant Joseph Huguet on his blog.
After taking the view of Puigcercós's ideology, this innovation counselor took over the fact that the leader will be confirmed as "a substitute for several objectives".
And he named them five, out of which there are two.
The first is "recommination" of executives in order to represent at least 90% of the members, which means also new forms that are from the Carod's forced sector.
A second goal can be a big news story.
Huguet suggests that the ERC will complete its meeting as a functioning mechanism.
It is thus fighting for reform of the state so that the Congress can be concluded by means of elected delegations.
The conclusion of the model of the meeting system, except in the Spanish political party system, is the objective of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction for the last two weeks.
However, the 2008 Baptist meeting decided that the meeting should be reviewed at the special Congress on State Reform.
This concern is still pending, as the situation within the party has been reflected in the resolution of this matter.
Now, without the growing critical sectors, it could be appropriate once again to stay and try to close it once again.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico reported 4 cases compared with 2010.
During the November period, 23 people were killed in Mexico, less than four times as reported by the MILLENIO.
Among the murders are three women and a couple of separate bodies are found in the Gulf of Mexico.
In the last month, there are 390 killings in Mexico, probably associated with organized crime.
Among the cases are the deaths in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the Toluca period.
The victim suffered at least three shots, a further morning from kindness to his head and had his hands and feet tied to his leg.
The next day a body was found in the kitchen, which was placed in the rear of the vehicle over the Mixtecas street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán colony, during Naucalpan.
On Thursday, 4 November, at least three fatal shots of torture were revealed by the body’s associates at Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal in the summer of Villa Guerrero.
According to the body, she found a report that was probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacan.
A day later, in Nezahualcóyotl, a ten - year - old man was shot eight times after he left his house and wanted to start collecting waste.
On November 7th, two victims were shot at the head of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, 30 years old, during the Ecatepec period.
In Chalco there was a dead man shot in the head on a long road in the El Naranjo colony, and there was a calibre gun in the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the waste water channel in the Playa Golondrin colony.
The rescue files were made by a thorough search of other parts of it, yet they were not found.
The Tepotzotlan residents reported finding bodies with their hands tied back and their head fixed on Pena Colorada.
A man had a shot from a gun to a gun.
In half a month, two men were notified of the murder of two men who were arrested in the bedroom and left in the parking space of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda during the Atizapán de Zaragoza, who were also killed.
The day after that, it was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony during the Los Reyes La Paz cardboard box, which contained the human head.
in the nearby colony was found the remains of the body, wrapped in a black plastic bag, reported by El Incorregible.
On the seventh day, two dead women were caught in the bedroom in the Zoquiapan camp during the Ixtapaluca period, and the second morning there was a murdered man in Huixquilucan who was in a zeltomodal room, which was primarily reported to have been killed in his body, identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaluca there was a woman without a sign of life with two arms in her pocket.
The tattoo of the sacred status of Santa Muert (the word "Holy Death" – p.m.), as well as the patrons of hers, was shown on the skin.
At the end of the month, in the town of Zinacantepec, a dead man was found in the car with at least three shots and a report signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, two men were found with their head covered with sand and a report was found in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim's report was probably one of the criminal organizations in which it was said, "This will happen to those who do not. "
two bodies were found in Ecatepec, who did not send signs of torture and had a linked conclusion, within a taxi left behind by the Centre for Justice in the San Augustine colony.
The last day of the month, two men were found in the Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them was a wall and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with sand and left a message; while the other was buried and found in the plastic barrel in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together, they found agents and a list of reports.
China achieves its objective to reduce the melting of liquids
The representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change COP16 found that its country had developed extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon footprints and stressed that it needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will achieve its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN climate change conference.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Contracting Parties to the UN Treaty on Climate Change, Su Wei ensured that his country had made an incalculable effort to reduce the carbon level and transform its industry.
He said his country had already invested 245 million dollars in the effort to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases over the last four years.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He pointed out that the Chinese strategy for climate change is divided into the following four posts: dialogue, capacity-building, institution-building and support of pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been made, including the lower approval of the new energy law, which includes the proposed objectives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
He further stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
As he said, several plans have been in progress or have already been completed, which have been financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, it was pointed out that the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the last five years, had received investment from the UN, government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change is also running, further the project of exchange of savings for the suspension of cereals and the project of mitigation and adaptation.
In the same table, Martin Krol, a professional adviser to this country for climate change, found that China's efforts were greater than he generally thought.
For example, the emissions of greenhouse gases on one citizen are 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts, for example, to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects further progress by 2020.
Exemption from Spain: César Nava
The National President of the PAN (Partido Action National, Czech National Action Party, etc.) stated that the former President of the Party was entitled to request his rights to the National Order Commission.
The National President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, found that the expulsion of Manuel Espiny Barrentos was legal and that the former President of this party was entitled to refer to the National Order Commission and to apply for his right.
In his speech, which was ordered by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the expulsion of Espina is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"It's an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonor."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address in his case by means of a complaint to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure of the International Council in order to agree on a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now is no time to think about 2012 and that she was never at the dedication table on the presidential candidate alliance.
Nava Vazquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will come out of the internal elections of the following 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be loved, strengthened.
"This (liance in 2012) is the theme that has never been at the dining table, at least not over time, was a goal for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The President of the PAN said that there is a 71-year dialogue on his side, and that is why "we don't get internal competition, but we're tired of it and it's strengthening us," he added.
He said that the Committee would be able to choose the best president or the president who will serve the PAN for the next three years without debate, so he would give the sign to "who the Committee will appoint".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, any of the five most proud of the Bureau of the Parties."
He suggested that the rise recorded by the party in the last July elections would be reflected in future rounds, even though "there is no time to think about 2012".
"There is no need for Governor Gabin Cué to perform this task."
In this context, he pointed out that these three governments, having roots in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the train and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, because "there are a lot of expectations and accusations in them, and I am sure that Gabino will have this expectation."
When we asked her about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón on the part of the PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, etc.) for his four years of government, César Nava invited the members of the PRI to think about the six-year period of former presidents Ernesta Zedilla and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the government of Zedilla and Salinase in the PRI is thought to have been better than the rule of Foxe and Claderón, let them begin to deny them to get out of their streets," he testified.
He claimed that the head of the Federal Executive Force has the right to express himself as he did during the event in the National Auditor, since there is no use of theft or censorship in that country.
Obama promotes on Twitter the law to support students without evidence
"If you think the adoption of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to accept this law," the president of the United States tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama today contributed to his personal social account on the Twitter network to national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legislate students without documents.
"If you think the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and hurry to accept this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet reference to a more comprehensive document requesting the public to unsolicited contact of senators, as the vote on this law is approaching.
"Because it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now it is time to let your opinion be taken," she says.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless an increase in the tax exemption from Bush's summer and government funding has been approved.
Such blockade, which was notified by the letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect voting on the Dream Act Act and other projects, such as ratification of a new Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons called the START.
When it was asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act Act and other proposals, the president expressed his belief that the next time a fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to set up a calendar for the remaining projects.
"I believe there's still enough time..."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the issue of taxes before the end of the year..."
I believe that we can reach agreements on this matter at some point and then we will be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Harry Reid Senate announced in the afternoon that he would request "voting for the conclusion of the debate" concerning the Dream Act, so the proposal for the legalization of students without evidence could be voted in the Senate on Thursday, although it is likely next week.
The senatorial approval of Dream Act or the law of the "American dream" would legislate the mass of 800 thousand young people who had been admitted to the United States 16 years ago, remained in the country for the last five years and were admitted to higher education institutions or to the army.
However, supporters need 60 votes in favour of the proposal, because several Republicans need help, so its associations make intensive efforts to ensure the approval of this law.
Democrats whose most Dream Act supports have 58 orders.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of India, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the supporters of the Dream Act project need to get several Republicans to decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the most closely associated, the senators of Maine Olimpi Snowe and Susan Colins are the senators of Florida George Lemieux, who complemented Senator Mela Martínez's mandate.
Other republicans who in the past supported Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchson from Texas, but told you that she is no longer supporting her.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet appeared.
Although Snömovna representatives are invited to another version, according to most analysts, Dream Act will face the greatest obstacle in the Senate.
with literature inserts the finger to the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "insert the finger to the wound" is the period of the Czech "order the finger on the head - after all.)
The second cycle of language pleasure was a walk where participants presented the literary gallery of presentation
"That's why I understand Sexem in Spanish, but... What's going on? What's waiting for me?", writer Luis Valenzuel, who was invited to start a second cycle of pleasure from the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and her question was used on this occasion as a title (in other places, the theme of the golden table was the Sex in the language, explained).
The finger to the wound "we bring to tears," brought an Argentina writer to the audience, composed mostly of young people, who met at the International Library in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the golden table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuele, Sergia Ramíreze, Mayry Monterès and Luis Garcíi Monter.
Luisa Valenzuele read the text delivered by Gonzal Celorio, which Schultze noted after a great story, in which Luisa appeared in the first person as a protagonist who, when looking for a diagnosis, comes from a doctor who does not receive an answer even if the same story is yes.
From the infector comes a confirmation: "patience is not my strong side, maybe it will be my wound."
Finally, after frustration with traumatologists who took her breath in the middle of the road, he explained that the morning is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalysis that reveals the secret: "the wound represents a really dissociated and symbolic is the tail."
The protagonist slowly woke up and concluded that "in the morning she was able to know only so much that she was really confused and that she did not exist," but found out that joy and passion in language had to go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel's game with both of them.
Nicaragujec Sergio Ramírez also appeared with a lovely report that called the Praise of the Inventory, in which the finger is not named in the morning, but at one time it will appear.
from the beginning of magic realism, she brought back the famous witch who played the clouds, who went away, or made the honour that one woman lost, this story that turned to speak to America, a big novel, where from the beginning his own chronicler who told her, is quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises the movement of the recipient's capitals.
"Cervantes, who found us all, laughed at the fictional witness presented in the future as real, but in another way he never managed to tell American stories with such educational skills that he even did so."
However, he highlighted that "these are crazy and liars who have more fantasy" and just where the reality and lies that no longer exist, which belong to one group and what is to the other, achieve the fictional literature of their top.
It's called the "servant tradition".
"We have what we have through his resignation."
Next Mayra highlighted and praised the diversity of interpretation, which enabled the invitation of the International Library of the Church of England to speak with his first word, Prst.
The Cuban-Portuguese writer showed his finger on the big front of the social violence that goes through her country - and divides it into Latin America - and is the result of commercial disputes and drug trafficking.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, and good music will close the secret compromise that is not of course intended," she said after stating that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the compromise created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
Last night, Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose appearance also cleared the cause of "this finger to the wound of the writer of the charged writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, as well as in intellectual habits and control of knowledge that violates dogmas, it is forgotten that "the fact that every attack is hidden from the small ones and that every attack is also a small one" is also a small one."
"To be the masters of our ideas and realities we need to be colorful: and to paint a significant number of times to put the finger into the wound and burden those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, blacks, mixed ideas and without coloring, and also to impose authority that prefers this black world," he said to support the meaning of the writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Rubén Omar Romano reads three paragraphs in the finals, during the career he lived good and bad, but he was already able to reach three possibilities on the rolling series.
in the duele of Santos Laguna and Monterey in the finals, there are also two different styles that identify with their techniques, teams that have a difference between themselves in results.
Rubén Omar Romano reads three breaks in the finals, during the career he lived good and bad, but he managed to reach out already on three occasions on the settlement series, but until now he left with an uninterrupted one, and that is why this opportunity for him is extraordinary.
Argentinic had to calm down with a silver medal, remained a step for victory and played with the same team of the following finals.
The Santistic Strategy as a coach came to its first finish in the Aupertura Tour 2002 when he was in the hands of the Morelia Club, with which he held a total of 4-2 against Toluce; then in the Clausura Tour 2003 he re-entered into a diluent double and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
With the club Santos Laguna in the Tournament of Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "dangerous" from Toluky, Rubén again endured a strike, although his team played against the "Uzenars" (the next review of the Deportivo Toluca Club - p.m.) after 210 minutes of games indistinct 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he won three times and had two opportunities to cover the title, but at the end of his three players passed from 11 steps and the team was thus patient to 4-3.
Rubén has already won two finals against the "Red Devils" from Toluky and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to escape the same judgment and escape the curse, and he could first celebrate the title, even though he says he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to talk about statistics, this is for the club, for the wedding I'm bound to, and the title would be for me, but it's the first thing," said the coach when he was stressed about the number that speaks in the final against him.
in the live memory, the previous finals, in which he confirmed many of them, "when we learned that until the decisive end of writing, we can't celebrate, we must be ready for action, just like the players, because we were ready to run away with the two pens last, and I think that we have learned in this, until the party is over, we can't celebrate."
She does not worry that this series could be decided in criminal shootings, she says to her players: "Never try to come to a series of criminal riots, try to end up in normal times, but there is never another chance, and we should be prepared for it, in the past tournament, we were prepared, but unfortunately the trial came wrong, perhaps because of the nerves or the difficulties we felt when it was titled in our hands, but we lost it in our body, and we hope that this time will not come to something like this."
Romano has the chance to stop being the second and taste the first praise that the titles bring.
United States of America Change the rules for the sharing of visas
People will have to turn to the Service Centre for visa applicants even before the meeting at the Consular Division; costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the water management process will be changed to the United States and consulate.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to turn to the Centre for Visa Applications (in particular from the ASC) even before consulting the Consular Division.
The staff from the ASC will collect biometric information from the applicant and you will be assessed by the Advisory Division prior to the conversation.
The new procedure will have certain benefits, including the following:
The total costs for the visa facility will be lower and no payment will be required for the agreement, the second for the processing of applications and the second for the provision of a transport service document.
The applicant shall pay only the only payment that covers all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to 140 dollars for tourist visas, 150 dollars for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for visas for traders and investors.
People who want to resume their visas will not have to conclude a conversation with the consular officer, but they will only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and receive fingerprints.
In view of the fact that biometric information will be collected in ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the Consular Division will spend less time than in the past.
Similarly, those who will request visas at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay extra fees for 26 dollars.

NASA announces the appearance of foreign life
The U.S. Space Agency agreed to a press conference tomorrow to present a statement that could lead to violence in the pursuit of foreign life.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) will inform the United States tomorrow, on Thursday, of an astrobiological phenomenon that could confirm the theory of the existence of foreign life.
The exhibition will be presented tomorrow at 13 hours of experts on astronomy, science based on study of origin, evolution, expansion and the future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the journalist, NASA assured her that she would present "a statement that causes violence in the pursuit of foreign life", which raised the speculation of experts from other countries.
The revelation could confirm that there are other creatures besides us and other creatures living in unhesitating conditions that were considered unaccompanied and which could represent the possibility that one of them would become intelligent creatures, like humans, if the better conditions in which they live.
It seems one of the microbes found on the island of Mono in the Yosemitic National Park in California, where it lives in the middle, which was considered too cheap for any form of life, since the lake is rich on the arsenic.
The creation of Arsen in some way uses his life and just this ability increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
Astrobiologists say, if these organisms use arsenic metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another, different form of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will announce the actual arrival of the announcement at the next press conference.
The conference is a participating geobiologist, Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of existence in Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that his chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PPD, PT, Convergence and Patron produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", they announce.
The 60th parliamentary period was not even started when the opposition block was launched in Congress, led by the PPD (Partido de la Revolación Democratica, Czech "Strana Democratic Revolution"), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Strana Jobs"), Convergencia (Czech "Shoda") and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvem, who had been declared independent, and these four were discussing one thing: the future of "bipartism" to Snow.
Prior to the start of the 60th parliamentary period, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynos Sparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PPD and Patron Montalvo "swear" against the reform of the Constitution, as it states.
This reform, they repeat, begins "bapartism", because now it will be two persons from the same number of sides who will rule Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarito Santos Aquilar, the coordinator of the PPD, were the only to vote against the Council led by Salvador López Britem from the PAN (Partido Action, Czech "National Action Party") and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo pointed out that these reforms institutionally create political marginalism by the party PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech "Revolving Institutional Party") and the PAN.
He stressed that during the next few days they would talk to the PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they did not, they would be re-examined by the two parties that ended the opposition coalition.
"When I came here (opposite coalica), I look at it because we're out of any decision, even if they don't even want to consider the opinions of others."
Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez from Convergencia indicated that they agree with the PRD, PT and Patron and will therefore create a pluralist group.
It can't be allowed, he continued that Congress after what was monopolial was now "double".
The hope of reform is not that there will be endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and now talks with other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez has added.
Ezequiel Reynos Sparza from the PT page explained that Congress has now become a "use" of two – in the introduction to the PAN and PRI.
"Only one side of it once ruled it, and today it is divided by two."
Mr. Montalvo asked for respect for the delegation's personality, to be given a place at the same table.
"To see us five Members who are likely to be nine, but right now see us in five, we have not left because of the stolen agreements outside, each in another group, we have agreed to find a place at the same table, since the problem is that in the reform that they have created and voted out, we are standing outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
It looks like another 200 thousand pesos for "supplier"
The office in Mazatlan will pay another check of the company's owner of supplying electricity.
Another check on something more than 200 thousand pesos was sent to the workshop by Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
The amount paid in this second half of the company's holdings of electricity is estimated at 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the workshop, this last check of number 9258447 was issued on 16 November this year, it was presented to a total of 200,144,56 pesos and as its subject, it was mentioned as "equity of unpaid payments".
Co-rapporteur Luis Miguel López Moreno pointed out that the property will be paid by this supplier, which was monitored by the Vrch State Audit Office for sales at high prices, another volume.
What has not been said is the whole area that still owes it to her, and how many more checks will still be sent in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't bought now, it's only paying for what we owe it, just like other suppliers," he said in one conversation.
The last checks were "born again" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 October 15, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although the company has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as a result of the law in the case of a company audited by the Vrch State Audit Office, to avoid the use of their services by other regulatory authorities, the contractor has found that the service of the consultant has not been used again.
In the past, after 25 July, D. Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by his consultants, who claimed that during the period from March 2008 to 9 June 2010, during the three-year period of the age of George Abel Lópeze Sáncheze, the city of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos by means of 42 checks.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she placed checks on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need maintenance
Tourist managers are struggling with the lack of foreign tourists because of the bad situation of Sáncheze Taboady in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the deep in the village of Sáncheze Taboady, the tourist sector in Mazatlan is asked to pay attention to areas and places that are in bad condition and do not show such presence in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders in Zone Dorada, recalled that they repeatedly asked to return to the home of the destination, and the bad things the tourists find here to be replaced with new activities or trails.
He pointed out that the wrong attitude of the street and of the passengers is affecting tourists who are passing through here and seeing a mess that has an adverse impact on close businesses.
"Politicals don't know what it is to shut down on one day of business, and they don't have a picture of markets that avoid, otherwise these concerns would not be solved so long and without proper planning."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the pay of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance from the workplace.
"The Council will have to assume responsibility and prevent such a repetition, it will have to pay preventive maintenance, not only to correct existing commitments," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, since not only because we are a tourist area, but also as citizens, we deserve a clean living place, the council should change its strategy of maintaining the city."
There are other places that seem to be neglected and murderable, such as the Mazatlánski Emblem and El Venadito (monment, socha jelena - ponn. recl.).
"In today's time tourists, regardless of their promotion, should offer a good product, and then a city that reflects the purity of their beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The need for attention has been ignored here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to all, maintenance is missing.
Speaking of a number of places to be arranged in cooperation with the workshop, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has a tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a tourist promoter, said that the preservation of tourist facilities in Mazatlan is costly because they are not properly used and do not make good home.
The success of Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and areas, however, which will need to be put in order first so that we can attract these places and bring them to the list we have to promote this destination."
IP requests for results by Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members to take great responsibility for their example in looking for better Sinaloy in various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary period is full of decent work and without agreement between the parties and the State enforcement forces the business sector in Mazatlan, as Sinaloa faces serious problems.
The 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 MPs PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Party of Nueva Alliance, two from the PPD, one from the PT, one from the Convergence and the last from the PVEM, which includes 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of the Congress is to enable them to implement sound guidance, commitments towards society and the various areas requiring responsible legislative work, and that they will not be repeated by the same party and patriarchal patronage.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 Members of the Congress be given much responsibility and went on the road for the better of Sinaloo in the various challenges ahead.
"We expect that the Members will actually exercise their rights without agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to satisfy their own interests and become the Carnival traditions of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the obligation to establish the necessary breaches which would impose the rule before the order.
"We want them to do decent work and are primarily committed to companies and sectors, because they were the Sinaloys, who gave them their voice in the past elections of confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the greatest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to collect all the strengths to achieve economic growth in the country, as the current economic situation is very complex.
It is most important that they undertake economic growth in order to create investment and infrastructure tenders, which support in some way the creation of jobs."
As regards travel, he requested new legislators to give him greater attention in the context of the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I realized that this is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is not targeted because it is an important economic activity, bringing value and investment, which is also directly opposed to agriculture."
In addition to providing funds to start-up tourism projects, Congress should help to add the state to security and help with the alcohol law that failed to resolve in the previous parliamentary periods.
They're looking for Three Kings.
Pancakes, cars and bicycles are together with other toys on the list of children invited to the Coronad Valenzuel family.
For their parents, it will be difficult to fulfill their three kings' wedding vows, since their home is read directly by 12 people and one mayor.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kašpar, Melichar and Baltazar will make toys and clothes that are so expensive.
The family lives in a humble shelter in the city of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because the husband doesn't have luck, but we're selling mandarins and hambores... and I'm gonna go out on the street on Sundays," said Cayetana Valenzuele Andrade's mother.
Four-year-old Adelaida is ahead of a woman or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Miss Barbie.
When it comes to decades José Alfred, he'd like to have a "monster" car for a while, and for his eight-month brother, Jesus, Cayeta would like to dress in a size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I'd like this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see the son', because it was very expensive," recalls Cayeta.
For older children who were right at school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a 12-year-old Isaiah size 10, which eight-year-old Miguel wears size 8.
The four-year-old José Juan's lack of tennis, so he's going to have a couple of five and a half or six.
If you want to help fill the dreams of children from the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can join the campaign "Look at Three Kings", and bring gifts or money in cash at the reception of the Noroeste diocese.
14 suspect drug dealers who were arrested
A tenth of the survey was carried out in Estonia, in the middle, in the framework of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of the Indian knop.
Forty persons were arrested and accused of various charges.
The visits took place in Sherbrook, Orford, and Stoke, mainly in places that served as a drug production.
"About 750 yards of an Indian horse, four kilograms of hair, money and equipment that served the production were fun," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a language police officer in Quebec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of which were thought by the chief of this network, two men from Sherbrook.
Prisoners had to be brought to the justice court in Sherbrook next after their arrest.
They could be accused of the production of an Indian konop, his keeping with the purpose of trading with him, stealing and stealing, among others.
These visits followed a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to access this arrest," said Mr. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 regional police officers to investigate the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, State Police in Sherbrook and Sherbrook Memphrémagog Police Department.
The illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal of the law of conservatives who, according to the Government, should regulate the problem of ships imposed by illegal passengers, will be clearly overcome , while all three opposition parties in the medium report that they cannot support it.
"A significant measure is the description of Chart."
"I stand directly on the side of the page that was building a complaint under your feet," announced librarian chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by a delegation after a week's meeting du caucus.
Liberals insist that the proposal of the law, as proposed, is a law that would allow for the maintenance of up to one year of any person coming from the ship, identified as a ship carrying an illegal carrier, to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
Chief of Quebec's Block, Gilles Duceppe, also pointed out that he can't support the proposed law because he's headed for the wrong target.
"We're against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, we'll see what the government does," Mr. Ducepe said.
The NPD criticism on the issue of immigration issues, Olivia Chow, rejected criticisms that want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigration.
"The non-democratic agreement with us to take action against the leaders of illegal passengers, and that is what we consider to be a good part of the other proposal, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the proposal of the law of conservatives, because it takes wine to be kept and is in custody for children for at least one year," explained Mrs. Chow.
Minister for Immigration Jason Kenney accused opposition parties.
"Canadians report together to the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that carry on to Canada and associate with it as a patolisar."
They expect Canada to take further action, Minister Kenney responded.
The government has not voted in favour of its proposal of law, which could lead the country to its resignation.
One conservative then said the QMI Agency would require the government to vote in order that every messenger who is opposed would respond to his presence in front of its voters.
New Unit Meaningless Sensitivity
Through the announcement that the establishment of permanent units for combating corruption and corruption is possible, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public investigation commission for this problem.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, urges that this opinion does not fall to memory: Québec has agreed with the Department of Investigation in New York to discuss this issue in January of the following year.
Metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why the fire alarm didn't surprise one of us.
It should be noted that during the meeting of the Standing Council on Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not implemented even though Robert Dutil was also present.
It was no longer necessary for the public security criticism, PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to assess this announcement as "the queen of the skull" and "amateur solution to the knee".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those who fear that political power has too much impact on the possible future of the unit.
"They shall be satisfied with the assurance: you shall see the result when we declare it."
"We know this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejeana Parenta, there is nothing to restore the hearing of witnesses in public proceedings.
"In addition, Mr Charrest is determined not to create this investigating commission, and people think, like you and I, it's hiding something," he explains.
"The only means to achieve the creation of a commission of inquiry is Jeana Charesta," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and politics at the Institute for the Education of High State Officials.
In order to be able to get out of this dark street, Quebec proposed to make a special strengthening of the general inspector so that he could investigate the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the General Inspectorate," he said.
It is also because Quebec could give inspectors the same powers as Commissioners that allow people to testify.
The establishment of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charter of Government records.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Third Law so that it would be better suited for this kind of criminal activity.
This requirement would arise from the Ombudsman for the operation of Marteau (Kladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that the judicature in this kind of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his associate in court, Rob Nicholson, is right about some of the amendments related to this letter.
In the operation of Jaro 2001, which belonged to a group of bikers, although the Third Law was not yet implemented, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa then left to make changes to the Gangsters Act.
The words under direct scrutiny.
A number of water flows have been under close control because of the heavy fighting that fell from yesterday in several regions of the province.
In the middle of the afternoon in Shawinigan on Mauritius came to the bottom of the ground.
Two houses were virtually evacuated.
Yesterday came to the next basement in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The train's broken.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, a number of regions of mighty battles, i.e. extended from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 other millimetres were not expected from day to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The cuts to the north of the river and to the valley of Outaouais were most marked.
It could fall up to 100 millimetres.
If we count these conflicts with the snow collected in some sectors, we can fear floods in some watercourses.
The rescue service of Quebec announced in the middle of the night a warning against the danger of the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The north, in Saint-Jérôme, in Les Laurentides, and in Chéne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of preliminary and uninterrupted controls.
In the area of de Lanaudière, there have been strong attacks on the development of certain lakes, in Sainte-Juliane, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the result of heavy rains was a provisional bridge.
Two residents had to be safely evacuated.
In Otaouais, some lakes from the coast opened some roads, especially in the Mansfield-et-Pontefract village.
The rescue service has a readiness and looks at the situation in this area, Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Water Prediction Centre issued a warning in the middle of a series of strong rivers for several rivers, especially Masingoé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blammed
Quebec’s resolution moderator Stéphane Dupont endured a share of the shock before the Canadian Council for the standards of radio and television broadcasting (RTV) due to the controversial effects of social assistance and the Haitians, and also as a result of the gross disclosure during the release.
The Board of Appeals and Television considers that Mr Dupont and his group of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the products contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative exclusion of the Haitians, which does not correspond to the transmission sent during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion on suicide, including the sending of the names of the two persons who took life, did not violate the rules for the release of the vote.
The Council for Radio and Television has received several comments from the Commission from 2008 to 2010.
The first decision was made after the failure of the Common Front of the beneficiaries of the social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
Modulars must provide relevant information, not noise.
As for suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of jealousy.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission is of the opinion that the controversial episodes of the sending of the "Doptonary Weather Reports" have been found on a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no escape against him.
The last dispute was the announcement that followed after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort were then exposed to the media, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator stated that he did not send any gifts to help the Haitians, because we can't be sure that the necessary money will actually be provided.
The Commission is of the opinion that these comments were not justified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unwarranted negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already opened my class record of this thing."
"My record is empty for one and a half years," the moderator declared.
In all decisions, the Commission shall refuse to use a gross disclosure.
In any event, the voice transmission of CHOI-FM worked "on the basis of its responsibilities".
For stations which will have to notify each other once during the main transmission within three days, the results are minimal.
King of the Montréal.
The citizens of Montreal, from Algeria, Nacerddine Earth, have an extremely special time.
The athlete who results in "sande" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxu and the Thai box, joins the dads and rings around the world and looks for new challenges.
"I started with war arts such as kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, I explained Earthmal, who lives in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for games so much everywhere, because for those who don't like games on the ground that appear in war sports, competition in North America is great."
Recently, this man who works as a protector and assistant to the UPS company just added to his opponents bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Cart and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 October to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I played category kickboxu full contact and Thai box, put in."
"I am currently preparing to China for World War I in a dream show."
"They were invited to join the first four of the world's final mysteries in each category."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won a bronze."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up eight."
"In 2007 in China, I finished the tournament on Friday, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished the third, I added."
"It's interesting that in every competition, I made some progress."
"This time I'll be the first year or the last one!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline coming from China, where the fingers and legs, as well as the skin on the ground, are allowed.
The tapes are usually played on the floor and are more common in the ring.
The most famous boxer of this kind of war is the American Vietnamese source of Cung Le, well-known in the world of war art.
As long as Nacer Earth has to keep in its career only one result, it confirms its right to participate in the Superturnal "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a sympathetic boy."
"It's so small equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
The earth won its first game, in its semi-final category (80 kg), before it suffered loss in the final.
"The one that hurt me was a real trial, analyzed."
"There are four competing categories (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"Victial semi-finals run in their finals."
"Then every category of winners will run for the sole champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million spoken without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed after a mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering to the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this villa, more than 100 contracts are the only corporation created by BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which obtained the most significant contract, a contract to manage the whole project at a total of $295 million without public competition.
This Consortium, called Energy Management, was jointly completed in 2004 with a selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector to manage this significant hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium obtained a lucrative contract without any statement of public competition.
For Quebec's side, the complexity of the company's Consortium poses a serious issue of the ethical character, which risks the elimination of competition and creates price increases.
"It's a new way to realize collusion and distort competition."
"This means that people no longer make secret contracts, they're making them open today," said PQ Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
About something earlier this morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says it's not difficult how public interest can be sold like this.
Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalia Normandeau, tomorrow's intention, quite frankly, to go to this collusion contract.
"I've got my own way," she smiled and said that PQ was "inspired" and "precious accuracy."
She said "it would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of the Consortium is a common practice throughout the world.
It is a practice of an alliance, limited in time, which allows two or several companies to collect their mutual expertise so that they can answer the challenge of offering an offer to a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very compatible with the complexity of the work.
The status is already running and must be broken down by 2012.
However, the contract was approved without competition being compatible; it was a trade.
It is also necessary to acknowledge that the form of the Consortium is no longer an exception in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects.
As last week Le Dever left, the form of a consultation in the field of engineering is the subject of a government survey.
If we move to the quickest trade register of Quebec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 concerts, while some seem to be created.
This company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; we call CIMA+, Genival, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and they're dozens, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the Energie Management Consortium, the Minister of Normandeau emphasized in particular that "the land of La Baie James is typically a special dynamic of labour forces and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s."
The main sponsor of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), explained that it would lead us to conclude our head above the fact that the project management contract was concluded after mutual agreement.
"If you go to public competition and if there's a few participants in the competition offering, your offered prices can be higher."
"You have two options to choose: that is, to gather people who figure out the ban as participants in the competition, and to say, "Let's conclude the agreement at a peaceful and cost."
"But the main point is that the importance is not price, but human competence," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract made by the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000, which was held by the Queen of Quebec.
The contracts were closed by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ to the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification of Le Devor, he calculated 109 contracts for engineering advice concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out analysis of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin stole 22 contracts, from which Genival received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having to participate in "Energy Management".
All the contracts were closed.
The total is $449,783,344, including the contract with Energy Management company at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that the four companies that are part of the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau issued a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance it" before making it clear that it is more than one of its managers.
Barometer responsible for consumption - "green" label does not build trust
More green, but obviously sceptic.
The Quebec consumer is very little confident of sustainable development actors, but also of "non-foreign" signs and ecological certification, in order to guide him in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even if we buy in the media universe, which imposes on us and gives us more responsibility for society, this media space says that there is a lack of reliable information, a failure to fulfil the responsibilities that qualify even as a speed for its commitment, Barometer introduces the relevant consumption of which the first article was sent yesterday.
Even though the consumption of the so-called responsible products has increased in 2010, Quebec citizens who are trying to sell them do not believe them too much.
Two thirds of us in fact say they don't believe in the firm's promises about the environment just because the green advertising company finds out the measuring tool that was developed by the Observatory for the University of Sherbrooke's responsible consumption.
Other assurances: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates issued on so-called fair products, but also the reliability of products and signs that are identified as ecologically responsible, Barometertre notes.
The same way and policy debate on this subject is adopted as a series of 14.6% of Quebec's citizens.
However, the information on the relevant consumption may be the first to stimulate this website of consumption restored at the present time to nearly a third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, the vacuum and the wrong nature of the information would reduce the volume of 46% of consumers.
It's the second speed he identified Barometers at higher prices of these products.
Finally, a third of Quebecese citizens are untrustworthy about the data provided on the product or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the mark of one or more products that would respond to their beliefs.
All 61% of them prioritised the purchases in their fourth traders and gave priority to the purchase of food produced in their region, says Barometer.
More "green" and responsible - index of responsible consumption reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumption Québek is pleased to present as a king of recycling, which enhances at least the impact on the environment by taking care of the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological conscience apparently remained outside their vehicle, Barometer suggests: in 2010, nearly 28% of Quebec residents indicated that they use a mass transport or recommend the use of at least two people driving cars in the interests of nature.
The horse and bicycle also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive study of behavior that used this cliché.
State loan to buy a kine complex eXcentris
The government of Quebec, which we have requested for financial participation in the purchase of a kine eXcentris Society Angus et le Parallelle, agrees with the participation, but only to the top of the loan.
The "Angus et le Paralläle" developed company, which earned over seven million dollars from the cultural minister for the purchase of a cinematographic complex at the Tower of Saint-Laurent, which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not achieve what she had requested.
The Government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but in its own circumstances.
More than the expected gift, the government of Quebec proposes a loan that would ultimately be lower, some of which would be the original expectation that could provide a basis for a viable solution to the favourable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and demand for 12.8 million had already been abandoned by Quebec Loni on Friday, but applications have already been renewed for reduction.
The proposal and action plan were sent by the Prime Minister, St-Pierre, president of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's opponent came to the SODEC company on Tuesday.
Only Paralläle and Angus have time until December 31st to answer.
However, it seems that a state-owned mortgage must be really forgotten.
Let us remember that the Association of China owners and cinematographic centres in Quebec was created against the State's direct investment in order to support the resale of eXCentre, assuming that the Minister of Culture should not finance the project on property if he did not do so for other cinemas.
However, a number of participants in the debate called for basic economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his kin's space ten years of film art after he financed the complex building himself, which could be the reason for a change from the state's financial council.
The lack of seats for independent films is critical in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to obtain a permanent client.
Angus et le Paralläle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, conducts a campaign to release financial resources to the private sector, believing he's spending $700,000 for the auction.
Since 2009, one of the three film companies, Le Paralläle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The purpose of the future buyers is to reopen all three seats on February 27th next year and to offer the most beautiful Xaviera Beauvois Men and Gods film.
But Christian Yaccarini did not mention Le Dever and thus ignores his group's ideas about the reductions that have been made to him.
The most outstanding opposition in Canada as a whole...
The new American diplomats mentioned by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex Canadian minority against the Americans, but the U.S. authorities express their feelings of complacency to Canadians.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian volunteer lies in the heart of Canadian-American relations when it comes to vote, and believes that the visit of President Obama has helped the conservative government to accept her budget in 2009!
Four new reports between the American ambassador in Ottawa and Washington, posted yesterday on public opinion, provide more sensitive details to get "under the skin".
The communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. between the electoral campaign, shall specify in detail the extent to which the United States is not a party to which the political leaders are discussing.
To the great surprise of the American Revolution in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins has some explanation for this situation.
"Canadian minority complex, almost miraculous, calls for possible political leaders to talk about internal borders instead of realizing that these wills also concern the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
"The United States is, therefore,," he concluded, "a term of reference in these elections: all of a sudden, but potentially too dangerous to talk about them."
The speaker understands this "sounding silence" rather than that both countries maintain an intensive political and economic relationship.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party or even a better leader of the party to conduct these important relations should be the key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the elections."
Another expression of this feeling is that we can read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 Terry Breese, charged with affairs in Ottawa and Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your road will help ensure that governments are maintained when they vote on trust at the beginning of the U.S., concerning the federal budget, which Canada publicly recognises its first deficit for more than ten years, due to the plan to recover from $30 to $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to postpone the pre-session of Parliament so that it could not be broken down by coal and that opposition parties were undermining their survival of the quality of the proposed plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Wilkins, warns Washington on what continues to be a more negative picture that sets off dramatic series sent to the CBC in the United States.
Velvevislanek is worried about sending Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligent and H2O, in which you can observe not too much depth of references to the Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also on the charges for violent hearings in the CIA.
Another report refers to the fact that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some of the Guantánamos prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the principle of "the case".
At the end of the meeting, it says, "He passed some paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, state secretary."
"The secret agreed that the file was revising."
Finally, let's say that the people involved in WikiLeaks are coming.
Tom Flaangan, former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, announced on the CBC trains that the person responsible for this mass destruction should be "destroyed".
That's what happened and what happened to Mike Huckabee in the United States.
World Relight Relight Plan
In Cancún yesterday, the UN proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, trade lighting and industrial space in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the next limit, which should be aimed at stabilising the planet’s climate from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the process of major specific projects that the UN wants to spend in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of difficult commitments to reduce industrially developed countries.
According to yesterday's proposed plan, if the dispersion of cells that monopolize more 50 to 70% of the market, we will replace them with fluopactic or, rather, better, electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the basic amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet would be offset by light.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's a 70% equivalent emissions from the car park all over the world.
In the last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, joined voluntary reduction plans that should allow the reduction of GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be calculated from this balance of 5 Gt to achieve the stability of climate warming by 2020 at 2 degrees Celsius so that it can be ruled out without control.
95% of the energy is absorbed in the heat and the rest, i.e. 5% is the product of light.
The energy consumption is reduced by 75% with the flu-compact lamps and with the new DEL lamps, we reduce this consumption twice more.
The fluopactant candles will last from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new DEL brands, such as Philips' production this week - have reportedly participated in the OSN study - have an estimated life of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the scattered brand, which gives us the idea of a possible confrontation with the plan of compensation that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new candles can also function with residues and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any food.
A number of experts have expressed the benefits of fluecompactating candles because they contain mercury and should be classified as a dangerous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, although the producers would be able to collect.
However, as the report indicates, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions on the planet is not a flu-optimative greenhouse gas, but rather a heat-free electricity that releases a lot of electricity needed to produce contaminated electricity in contaminated greenhouses.
Only in the United States do these centers run 25,000 tons a year.
The report also provides details on the results of this international programme for each country.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars annually for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 heat electricity, whose building would be 2.5 billion.
The elephant coast is impatiently waiting for the results of voluntary results.
The General Secretary-General of the OSCE, Ban Ki-moon, requested immediate verification of the results of the presidential elections in the Border of Slovenia after the deadlines set.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent voluntary commission to complete its work and not to announce the preliminary results, to highlight the speaking of the UN President."
"All parties in the Border of Slovenia and the institutions are requested to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to maintain any initiative until the notification of provisional results."
Even through pressure developed by some foreign governments, the voluntary commission allowed the most recent date - Wednesday - without publishing results, three days after Sunday.
About forty minutes before the deadline was announced, the Chairman of the CEI on television confirmed that the Commission "retires on work", so that it can report results.
In the middle of the world , there have been numerous challenges for CEI to finally issue the name of the victory of the second car between Lieutenant Gbagbo and the opposition member Alassan Ouattar.
But the Gbagbo team is in favour of annulling the Constitutional Council for the "prominent" vote in the north, which was due to the former Rehabilitation of the New Army (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in the Slovene Coast, confirmed that the maneuvers of the fear of the voters who practiced the UN (New Army) in the north of the country made the president of the Slovene Borders from wanting to fly.
The volleyballs could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took note of the difficulty that Gbagbo has given.
President Gbagbo's opponents are convinced that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political link of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattar, a man from the north who demented any connection with the former rebels, condemned the detention in the announcement of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect it, but did not go so far as to require victory.
His associates confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, because he knows that he suffered loss and that giving the Constitutional Council the burden of preventing the voluntary commissions from withdrawing the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, which took place on Sunday, was considered to coordinate the process of reunification and peace of the country, which has been split for two and a half years.
The United Nations, in the middle of the political group, warned the Slovene border that it could be made responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished his first round on October 31, as a winner of 38% votes to 32% for Alasasan Outtar, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bedié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (ILO), remained stable by 9.3% in the French metropolitan area (9.7%, including the coastal areas), as shown by the provisional data on the correct seasonal derogations (CVS) published on Thursday.
The number of unemployed stood at 2,631 million in the Metro.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the population active in the metropolis and 9.7%, including sea areas.
The unemployment rate shall be increased by 0,1 per year.
In a broader prison, 3.4 million people in the Metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, whether they are available for two weeks, and whether they are looking for or not.
The current situation of young people on the labour market was still rising with a new rate of unemployment reaching 24.2% in the French metropolitan area (+ 0.9 in three months, +0.5 in one year) and 25% in the sea areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.
In the case of seniors, they reported a relatively steady increase in unemployment in the Metropolitan France of 6.4% in the Metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as per year), 482,000 persons over 50 years and 6.6%, including sea areas.
In addition to the 25-49-year-old population, the unemployment rate increased by 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 in three months, +0.1 in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishs the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, therefore continues to develop monthly statistics and announced a 9.8% peace for France (including DOM) in October after the fall of 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and he's in charge.
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the chief of the waste processing companies and a brother of the PS Governing Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was convicted and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into the matter of public orders, considered to have been found.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with the abuse of the property of the company, the abuse of public funds and the use of public property, the maintenance, the payment of taxes, the adoption of taxes for the purpose of affecting the authority and the detention of the gun, and the prosecution of his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions he would like to ask him, and no offenses."
"It's easy to follow her for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove it," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini pointed out through his lawyers that the judge had sent a brief statement to his hearing to explain everything.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned in the middle of the night.
According to his lawyer, Lucian Simon, his client never did anything else to ensure the operation of the warehouse he was supposed to fix.
As to the award of a contract or the allocation of funds related to their operation, he never knew anything about it, Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of agglomeration services Aubagne, was accused of using public funds and amployment, and left for freedom, under the jurisdiction of the court, of dealing with protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client has been able to explain to him all the facts that have been raised."
"The investigating judge will observe and let her go," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
The other four persons were charged and released on the night of the middle of the night, with two of them being held in court, by the representatives of State Governor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General of the Elegance Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is responsible for the adoption of taxes to affect the Authority and for passive corruption".
Two officials from Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "dignification and abuse of the property of society", the other for "compulsory in the use of public resources".
Finally, the trader Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "consuming the abuse of the property of the company".
Among the persons who were confronted with Mr. Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged with the case of double public orders relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company that they helped get money from vast gangs.
The investigation was conducted in the framework of several open trials against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymity letters relating to suspected doubts concerning the conclusion of public contracts, in particular in the case of waste.
From the source of a close investigation, monitoring is mainly focused on the conditions for the assignment and operation of the La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the town of Marseille (MPM).
The event Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian Palace has crossed Syria's media
During more than ten months, from June 2009 to May 2010, Clotildy Reissov, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spiones", shared his views in France, introduced diplomacy to war preparedness and highlighted the relationship between Paris and Tehran.
It's all closely followed by diplomats from the United States.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the consequences of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, and they went so far as to advise them how to manage such cases by hand in Iran (a small group of passengers).
They show how the leading French representatives tried to convince Washington that the release of young Francouzky was not compensated for the release of Majid Kakavanda, Iran, imprisoned in France and sought US justice for the underlying trafficking of material in the support of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they explain the clear way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the release of Clotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything about it.
The diplomatic telegram, signed on 12 August 2009, in Paris, has the title "Iran: French comments on how to solve the situation in the hands".
Counsellor from the Elysian Council for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, appointed by Director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of the American diplomat Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They recommend that Americans do the same so as to be brought back to their own national nationals by violence held in Iran.
"Don't play," they say, "keep your voice loud" in the media the words "the fundamental human rights", "innovation", "committed release".
It is necessary to bring into the cold Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it more than they'll ask you to stop it."
Because they've been trying to untie through discrete channels, "it doesn't matter," the Iranians are "murders to escape manoeuvres".
Mr. Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is "the Iranian family tactic: defending hands for the purpose of "political expression".
It states that the release of Clotildy Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, on the day when the French ambassador is granted a discharge) "is required to pay a high financial amount to the Iranians" (price 230 000 euros).
And let's say that the Elysian palace predicts cases of handmade phenomenon, which "will be burned up".
"In the future, the Iranians could arrest other 1800 French people living in Iran," he says.
of 28 August 2009.
Clotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains locked in Iran.
Information spreads: Iranian Majid Kakavand, on whom the United States declares that he was imprisoned for illegal trade with electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a decision of the Court.
The U.S. Supreme Court, like many observers, is asking for this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, who monitors the illegal Iranian network for the acquisition of material intended for the nuclear programme, Majid Khaqavanda is a bad report.
Did France join the contract?
Freedom of Iran for the release of young Francouzky?
In a further conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier confirms that this is not the case.
The Elysian palace, as he says, was not only "scrutable by the decision of the judge", but sought an opportunity to stand against it.
"The discussions between the Presidential Authority and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the decision of the court", he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Council of the Elysian Palace draws a telephone number, shuts down the phone, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is currently in the Parisian buildings under the control of the Iranian flagship."
At the time of the imprisonment of Clotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elisian Palace develops efforts, organizes, through the communiqué and organized "union" to the media, to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play "a significant" and "a influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation brings its fruit, as several articles in print reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blet" of French official actors."
As expressed against Mr Assad, this measure of "thank you" is a question for the declaration in Paris.
"And through their announcements, the French public officials in private recognize that they have only a valid idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then sets out the reasons that led to the Elysian Palace to pay in this case.
Intensification of the communication " refers to the validation of the policy of President Sarkozy's opening with Syria", he analyzes.
The policy implemented in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as early and unserviced".
By "as a victory over the Syrian role", Paris strives to "demonstrate Syria, which praisers can serve when playing a constructive role in the area".
The aim is also to "sit down the gap between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. ambassador knows it with a very good source.
On August 11th, François Richier said to him, "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we still thank them."
"This should at least introduce confusion and uncertainty between Iran."
Clotilda Reiss will return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is taking her to the Elisey Palace.
He thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the promotion of our country's liberation".
End on-line here after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt the law called "Pecíválský", which will order adolescents to play online games after midnight, by blocking access to it, by introducing responsible government actors.
The proposal will be submitted to Parliament on Monday so that the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family will be able to request online games to be blocked from this game by 16-year-olds after midnight.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with school education and are unable to live normal lives during the day."
"We have the view that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, a leading minister who has a proposal for an old-age law.
Online games will be available again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law.
The government also assumes that it requires companies to mix daily access to this game for young people whose parents ask for it.
Also available to people who require it, free programs that allow them to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "exploited" countries and daily printing brings regularly different facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an unspoiled mystery in the world's competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea received four gold medals at World Cyber Games, and this is made up of 58 other nations.
World Heritage in the years 2018-2022: Fifa is a host country.
Full room for suspicion of corruption is set up by the Fifa Executive Committee in the Fourth Host Country of the World Wars 2018 and 2022, the selection of highly motivated political motivations, where the fight against influence and lobbying threatens to advance technical criteria.
It is certain that the king's competition with Fifa in 2018 will be won in Europe, the traditional heritage of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain and Portugal, Netherlands and Belgium).
The mystery in 2022 will be much more exotic, while the International Federation hopes that it will be able to acquire a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the first president of the African continent in 2010, or continue to be established in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
A list of the persons involved in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) will be able to create a picture of the global economic and political terms.
Concentration in the lockdown will lead to the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish hierarchies according to candidates.
According to the evaluation report Fifa documents English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Commission within the hour appointed for the vote.
On Sunday Times at the beginning of the issue, leading to the suspension of two members of the EC /European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chance of their country, the coroners who still hosted the world champion only once a year.
The BBC set up the crown on Monday, when it issued a document entitled "Picking on the pen" three influential EC members (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa uncomfortable and bring into the hate English leadership with David Cameron in the first row.
The President of the Government hopes that he will be able to recover from those who led his predecessor in the role of Tony Blair, who was able to get to London for the organisation of Olympics in 2012.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to allow England to add a new bottle to its name in the EC (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the two Spanish-Portuguese do not miss the drums already prepared stadiums, their blessing (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, the Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the fragile economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give this ambitious student support.
The appropriate legal measures against the English and demand for the payment of Spanish and Portugal only increase Russia's position, which was outsider and beyond the borders of its documents (studios, hotels, transport).
However, the President of the government, Vladimir Poutin, decided that the mystery would not be transferred to the Kuruchi and publicly declared "no competition in the preparation of the vote", in the words only a few comments made on the claim of the English press against the members of the EC (European Commission).
"We're going to hunt for them, we're gonna try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be a logical favour with its significant experience since 1994.
The highest economic performance in the world, the seat of the chief sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a great impact on Japan and South Korea, which, in part, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidates appear to be early for both countries, which jointly distributed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the dedication of the 2026 world's mysteries of China, which has been a horror over Fifa, made an Asian chance for the year 2022 to be free of charge.
With Katar, who had emerged from the arm of the big wind in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue in its expansion to the new countries, but these two countries represent more risk than security.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, would be able to pay for a quarter of TV payments (because of the time line) paid by European countries, creating a hybrid force for Fifa.
Other: visibility (secure)
De Gaulle was really wrong.
Mitterrand woke up thinking he was pregnant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't even notice.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The mandate of the Elysian Palace allows someone else.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But obviously it's not in harmony with the secret part of the presidential function.
So it's supposed to be like the mistakes will continue to last.
In one way or another.
In 2006, before he wanted to believe it, his friends Jacques Chiraca made orders not to be expelled from the third mission.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy, with a significant statement, confirmed that "sometimes it will decide on the fall of 2011".
As recalled before the members of the UMP Parliament in the middle of the evening in the Elysian Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has been a little tense.
Was it the official notification of his candidate?
He wasn't far away from it.
The President only recalled that the revision of the Constitution in 2008 combined the number of five-year functional periods into two.
It was only a finding, not a notice.
It's not the first time she remembers such meetings with the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have seven and a half years ahead of you," he said in June 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about another stage."
His previous works will not make her a candidate more than the previous day; they will not make him a candidate even less.
If they make comments, it's due to two facts.
Fasting the way to the candidate to the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to the Ségolen Royal College, which's pressed by Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
Rather, it is because its candidate in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to be organized in the war systems more early than they were thought to be.
Bad research on the other side.
Firstly, the right-holders would prefer the candidate Françoise Fillon before the candidate Nicolase Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't discuss this with the UMP," they responded immediately and looked at people from the nearest corner of the government.
"If he believes a possible breach, he won't apply," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, who has the same appearance.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue in its purchases of national securities.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of Governors of the Central Year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the implementation of the crisis or, at least, to notify the large number of extraordinary monetary policy operations to be terminated by the end of this year.
The crisis created by European research implies that the institution will certainly not be able to allow such a catalytic under the threat of deterioration of the situation in European markets with securities.
The political price would be higher in such a case.
Yesterday, the French Ministry of Finance, Christine Lagarde, held an active role for the Central European Bank in resolving the crisis by European states.
She didn't mean to say if she thinks the bank could do more, for example, to increase its program to buy overdue bonds.
"I express my opinion to my European partners (...) "
Earlier in Brussels, at its hearing of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission of the European Parliament, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more explicit in terms of its objectives, and agreed to indicate that the programme purchases national titles on the secondary market "increased" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting that Thursday.
The only certainty: The European Central Bank will be monitoring its basic non-monetary peace by 1%, its historical lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of bonds made by the European Central Bank has doubled in the last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And because of the lack of understanding of the income market, new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds were made yesterday.
The euro system’s total central banks have acquired at EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There are no errors between the anticipating market agreement on the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economics do not expect any significant change in the course.
If the loan operations have already disappeared from the European Central Bank's Arsenal for more than three months, the latter named Bank shall apply to the provision of unlimited liquidity under major conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I cannot imagine that she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of a short-term new pressure," says Michael Schubert, an economist of the Commerzbank.
"Progressive output announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems to be more likely," says Norbert Bräms, an economy in Sal.
Openheim.
"The European Central Bank should maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to restore a smooth market," says Norbert Brams.
With regard to the exposure of European banks to markets, the debt raised in the euro area has no further choice than to maintain its market presence.
"It needs at every price to compensate for the lack of investors on the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the planning of the state's payrolls, which are among the most cross-border," said a major obligor yesterday.
Because if the wave measures fail, the states will try more to reduce their debt, instead of stabilising it.
It's a saved euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of the Berlusconi coast of the west
After the start of the week for Italy, the distressing situation was slightly relieved, last night with a return rate of compulsory interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary rest.
At the end of the meeting with the prime minister for the economy, the presidential regions said that they heard Julia Tremonti, how he qualifies for the situation as "unsolved" and that he expects "unpredictable" weekend, which was then demented.
In each case, in the summer of the long German routes, a record of 210 basic points and the price of a contract covering the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) was issued up to 263 points, which led to a certain settlement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers of Silvio Berlusconi, it was noted that in Spain there were more than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, announced himself that he was "infamous" with a "fragile market development" and possibly a leading source from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and unexplained fiscal revenues, which is going hand in hand and poses a risk that it will not be able to meet its financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were for the government of a student party.
Italy's growth is currently expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget is available to the Senate for its analysis, 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission will calculate the deficit of public finances to represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the coming year (about 3.9% of the estimated government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Here is a report on a new set of supplements to the proposal for a national budget, which could be made after the contracts, in excess of EUR 7 billion.
"If this is necessary, new urgent measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The basic stones of her economy are fine and her calculations are correct, we will repeat it a long time ago," says Arigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund Governing Council under the pressure of Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, no short-term or long-term, because over its significant debt (119.2% of the 2011 gross domestic product, NDLR), efforts to stabilise the demands in Italy are less than efforts from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Paduan, OECD's main economy.
There's a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will draw up a proposal to express confidence in the honourable Member and will then be able to organise the elections with which it is due at the end of the March.
Such a period would begin, little suitable for the adoption of a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde once again highlighted this in the Paris press conference last night: "I think that the Europeans have demonstrated this during the week and night, there are obviously a lot of solidarity decisions, commitment to defend their mine and their me zone."
Despite all relative, yesterday's recorded expansion on the lines to the European State bonds brought water to the millennia and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The standard & Poor's Notation Authority announced that it would be able to deduce a report on Portugal's debt, the objectives most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparent and transparent policy, especially on banking systems," says economist Exane BNP Paribas.
More than that, "political time runs shorter than market time."
Knowing this disruptive relationship and danger, which is hidden, the European country of discussion is intensifying, leading to the strengthening of existing crisis mechanisms.
Non-formal consultation between finance ministers, most of the problems involved, and in a broader way with their G20 counterparts, is very well developed.
With regard to the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) meetings and the Ecofin collection from the beginning of the next week.
The Central Bank's meeting is running today.
The programme shall be followed by a judgment of the non-conventional measures in support of the euro area countries with a market focus (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Finance (EFF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, recommended that you inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe in Singapore on Tuesday afternoon in Singapore after Asia.
If the purpose of this trip is not to raise funds, it shall prepare a reliable basis for achieving this objective.
The first issue of the FESF securities is scheduled for the next month.
Last night, the U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilized financial resources by additional direct commitment to the IMF.
The countries concerned in the first row, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, especially as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms contributing to immediate action with rapid impact.
Lisbon and Madrid are another route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid any price in order to apply for international aid before applying their own budgetary corrections and to decide on structural reforms needed to regain their confidence.
The capital participants in the European funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the market normalisation process with the above-mentioned bonds.
On its way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came to the conclusion that there would be no 750 billion euros of European and the International Monetary Fund, and that the Union would no longer be able to re-enter the securities market.
Economics with Barclays Capital, which is an actor of the first business plan with European top-up surveys, argues that the contribution of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "better" form of direct supply of financial liquidity.
The medium exists: it is the European financial stability mechanism devoted to 60 billion euros this day.
The Council which has all the opportunity to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have been compromised.
Snow and find: 24 countries have orange preparation.
Snowfalls are still causing problems in the right direction, especially in the other classes of Britain, and there is a risk that some economic activities will be compromised.
Twenty-four periods have since now orange preparation due to the risk of snow and it is found.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienna, joined for 20 periods that have already been declared orange preparation, 18 since noon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfalls cause problems in the north of La Gironde and Les Charentes and weak snow in Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the relevant periods and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
These include Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowstorms are large enough to cause problems in the right way and distort some economic activity, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some of the periods allowed a heavy cost adjustment - cost cars over 7.5 tonnes with the Guangamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on the railways of the second class of Britain is very difficult and the police recommend driving their vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been canceled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
In the evening, no specific measures are proposed to limit the cost of transport.
The Regional Authority "calls all car drivers to be the most careful of the trains and to adapt the driving behaviour of the vehicles".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has requested airlines to withdraw on Thursday 25% of their flights to the Roissy Airport and 10% to Orly due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that traveling, using air transport services, contact its company.
In Great Britain, the Gatwick Airport is closed in the south of London and the Edinburgh airport in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernization of transport to Ile-de-France in full flow, the first billionaires.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we mention 23 billion metro Grand Paris, which is to set up a company of Société du Grand Paris.
In order to allow this building to be demolished, he notified the state of supply of a grant amounting to EUR 4 billion.
Theoretically, it is a part which will then enable the SGP to use the funding part of its second source on orders.
We finally get to the first supplements today.
The Rectification Act of 2010 investigating the National Assembly's Financial Committee this morning contains the mechanisms set out for ensuring these resources.
They are two: creating special tax from equipment and raising tax from office to Ile-de-France.
First, we read in the text of the proposed law, Article 15, says "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated that "the amount of this rate is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the fees for the office that already exists, "to be modernized to increase the profit gained from it and to increase the impact of the company Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
It's crazy.
It's not numbered in the text.
We've got up to four billion.
"It is clear that these fiscal resources contribute to EUR 4 billion from the capital allocation, which will be mobilized by the State and put into the company of the Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in explanation of reasons.
We don't know what's going on in the SGP company.
"Since we created revenue (both taxes, etc.), we can cover the study for three years and then play up to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The GDP is expected to be allocated to 4 billion by 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which 4 promised billions are still unearmarked subscribers, is at risk of causing some bad parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Injects hackers and inducers
The case of WikiLeaks has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is a public scandal, a scandal that appears to be scandalous only in the face of the covertness that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it talks about profound changes at international level and predicts the future of a controlled regression.
But let's do the order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, is to confirm that each document composed of a secret service (any nation) consists entirely of print sheets.
The American's "extraordinary appearance" about the way of sexual life of Berlusconi is what every month has been able to read in any news (all except the two Berlusconi owns), and not the kadáfi's kadátur profile has been for a long time for a charming artist's shop.
The rule that secret documents should consist only of reports already known is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work is repeated (of Graal, the Rennes-le-Château, Temples or Zednær) exactly what has been written in the previous sections.
And that's not just because the author of the occult texts does not like looking for new information (he doesn't know where to look for the news of the non-existing) but because those who believe in occultism believe only what he already knows and confirms what he has already learned.
It's a success mechanism for Dan Brown.
He's also paying for secret documents.
The informant is a line, and a line (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if not, it could be, as I know, a editor in the news Release), who claims only what he knows.
The information with a high appeal about Berluscon, which the American press sent to the National Resort, was the one that Newsweek published a week ago.
Why, then, were these documents so common?
On the one hand, they say what every grown-up man already knows, and in fact, the revolution, at least from the end of the second world war, and from the time the heads of the states can call or fly on a joint dinner, they lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in the exhibition, have been transformed into a spy center.
Any admirer who follows the film of the investigation knows very well that it is only from the standpoint that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that this is publicly repeated, Hanobe's duty to cover up and makes it a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most accurate information that the most powerful country in the world has, as far as it can be concerned, represents a hard burden, even unsatisfying, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects the victim, his "executors."
But let's get out of here to the deep truth about what happened.
Sometimes, in Orwell's time, it was possible to take all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been demonstrated since, thanks to the possibility of controlling every movement through the telephone, every transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the use of the distance, and so on, became a free victim of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now that even "grabs" with the most intimate information of the powerful cannot afford the essence of a hacker, it ceases to be a controlled message and becomes a prisoner.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker - chosen as a citizen's founder - can know all the secrets of power.
How can you keep the power that no longer has the opportunity to keep your own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that true secrets are free of charge (and unconfirmed secrets will never be disclosed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is really a secret secret because it is derived from public life; but to prove, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were free secrets, meaning to take away all his power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake in Sarkozy or Merkel, but did something great for Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wound be so significant?
It is obvious that in the future, States will not be able to send online sensitive information - this would be equal to its publication on a street street street street street.
But it is also very clear that modern technologies are too confident that they can keep up with the news on the phone.
It's nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state was traveling by plane and connected with one of his colleagues.
How will they be able to be kept in the future in the pursuit of personal and sensitive messages?
I know that at this moment there is a forecast belonging to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to present myself to government actors who are transporting discrepancies in the form of uncontrollable trails and carry only those messages that are aware of or more hidden in the bottom of the box.
Information will be stored in unique copies in locked keys: quite well, the attempt to spy in the Watergate race was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had an opportunity to write that technology is moving ahead, that's the back.
One century after the wireless telegraph signaled revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated the telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogous) enabled fans to film a movie step-by-step, play it in front and back and reveal all the secrets of the installation, while now CDs (numbers) are only able to jump by chapters, meaning by macroportics.
By means of speedboats, we arrive from Rome to Milan in three and a half hours, while on the way to the airport and transport that includes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for policy and communication techniques to return to the vehicles attached to horses.
Last note.
The press tried to understand what was happening in the privacy of the mass media.
Now it's a statement asking for reliable information from the press.
Climate: how France hacks its financing promises
The year following the Kodań Agreement is the time to test the compliance of promises with fast-blocked financing (as described at the fast start (fast start) or early) carried out by developed countries.
The great French hacky has been removed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, the developed countries committed to providing $30 billion in the years 2010-2012.
The European Union pledged EUR 7.2 billion for three years and EUR 1.26 billion for France (this is EUR 420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU made a great deal to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to financing fixed start: a report clarifying the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a large side event, distribution of the brochure...
The respective operations are invaluable and assessed on their actual value: the developed country and civil society would want all the developed countries and civil society to do the same with the same accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010, it has released 2.2 billion euros, leading to the correct path to its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we'll find that things are much more complicated.
These financial resources are "new and additional" according to the Codán Agreement to ensure that increased burden is realized without the acquisition of public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, inter alia France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone picks a reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding was maintained and added 150 million to it for three years.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment periods or with terms at the level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France is that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in the past period or to the global level Public aid for the development of d'Aide publique au development.
In particular, France's total support for developing countries can remain unchanged (or even reduced), has to meet its commitment to financing "new and additional"...
Another rewarding first is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule there yet, and everyone chooses his own method of calculating.
Some, such as France, believe that 1 € of loans is equal to 1 € of a gift.
Of course, it's hard to prove: strength is not comparable.
If the use of the loan can be established for some of the investments that are profitable (often related to the reduction of emissions from more efficient technologies) it is foolish to present one euro that we will receive, as equivalent to one euro we give... , we should not buy it from the title of our commitments, but at the price of loans for a credit country (i.e. equivalent of interest rates).
But France can only provide the following justification: "holds" its commitment in excess of €420 million, making 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the grants (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union which uses the loan in such a way.
Germany has demanded 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovenia (between others) meet their commitments with 100% gifts.
Otherwise, it is said that if the rest of the European Union gives €1 in order to fulfil its promise, France gives only 10 cents and considers this power to be comparable.
A beautiful keeclair shirt!
For storage, France operates with two branches in its financing: on the one hand with the development of the stock in time and on the other hand with the real financial burden.
Although it only issues EUR 36.1 million, it is able to confirm that it issues EUR 420 million "new and additional" in relation to its promises.
The Minister of Finance (because it appears that, although Bertie, who made such a decision), could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to grant when it is available?) and when it is done, because the developing countries are not completely naive...
The pre-financing chapter is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to the climate debate series.
But it could also be a sandbag in a space machine with UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
In any case, it is necessary to withdraw the information from this first year of pre-financing.
First, France should notify the change in its way of conducting the accounts for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and obedience and justice towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should be discussing long-term financing (other basic chapter at the time of debate): we do not leave the question of "additional" or how to calculate the loan.
France should change its position to become as progressive in these deposits as it is in the others.
I hope that everyone will join the new Ministry for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of the fast start of France and its vision of "additionalness" and the use of loans could create an increase in the level of international trust needed to be able to be further discussed.
A warning about pesticides that children will wake up.
A 10-year-old looks at one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published in this medium, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Hunting for the Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of analysed samples, but are characteristic of the processing problem", bought between the Swedish and the food supply commonly consumed in four foods and one easy food as a small food for one child in the supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five juices of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water a day - as well as sugars, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy stones and other pollutants.
The analysis of thalire is striking: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which range between carcinogenic substances, possible or likely, and five of the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could be converted into domestic salts (PE), according to a study of several institutions such as the International Research Centre for Cancer.
"Even though in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical are not exceeded individually, in our research we see clearly that the reality in the consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogens, and/or PE is harmful," the association states.
For breakfast, butter and milk contain about ten residues with possible carcinogen effects and three shown as certain carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
Jablko, brought from Brazil, a study conducted as a small pigeon, contains six chemical substances, among other things, the prohibited functional environment in France.
It also pays for the green faeces in Kenya, including food in which the study revealed the rates of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition to soft meat bifthek, tonne in the lungs and even in the neck and thighs, pesticides and other chemicals were contaminated.
In the water from the cohet analysis, the presence of oxygen and chloroform was revealed.
Steak from lososa to dinner was "better" with 34 chemical residues revealed and even an analysis of the plastic workshop used for cooking food in the microwave troubus did not result in analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "containing cocaine" is likely to be underestimated," says the study.
The Ecological European Greening Group (EE-LV) proposed "to create a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the occurrence of civilisation diseases".
In the July study, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the status of the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables in Europe, from 76 in cereals.
