What is it? The ČSSD in Prague does not know either Voldemort or the pastry
The new ČSSD councils in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious linguistic barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the municipal council to understand their renewed partners in the ODS.
The current period.cz "examined" to the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the language marked slang which has emerged in recent years in the Council when the current members of the coalition were ruling Prague.
The codified speaker who used Prague's political flower and birth during the previous period, of mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most known characters, situations and causes of the Metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been verified that the new conceals almost do not understand those known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I am more an innovation in Prague's politics," he said during the review of the terminology of "collegeo" the cultural conceil of Lukáš Kaucký.
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel Brézina reacted similarly.
Maybe they know the concept of a golf course.
"It's probably the only expression of everything you asked me to use once in a while."
"If not, normally not using slang."
Of the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Actualnnn.cz last June before the ODS vote, the edition chose six examples, in particular those that are particularly related to the municipal authorities in Prague.
Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "major golf today of Prague", "to the pastry", "to the bull's neck", "to the capital" and "to the blind".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a room, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague, at first came in, but did not take the phone again.
The fifth coin, Peter Dolínek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't put myself in these things, I don't want to appreciate how democracies play."
"What I care about is how we understand ourselves in the implementation of our programmes," he said.
As has been seen, the Lukáš Kaucký conceț would have been unlikely to have been taken into account that the previous title was an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of the exalcalade Bém, Roman Janoušek.
Kaucký's word "Voldemort" doesn't tell you anything; the only term you found in the review is "the biggest golf game in Prague".
"It's about tunnel Blanca," says Kaucky, adding immediately: "But I know better about the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course," he joked.
Karel Brézina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf course the Blanca tunnel, but also the Medium Environment Conceal of Lukáš Plachy.
Then, both socio-democrats know who really is Voldemort and Lukáš Plachiy even knows where to find that character; he also suspects the meaning of "go to the priesthood".
"I think he wants to go to a company in Prague"; he soon finds out to Plachý that it is from the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Like Brézina, it indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the trial, among the socio-democrats there is no such family glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked my friends, but it really looks like we haven't got anything like it."
"Well, among us we use apologies, sometimes abbreviation or make word games with names," said the president of ČSSD Pragueense, Petr Hulinský, whose party partners call Hilda.
"In the college, I was called Bríza, but I don't know if my friends call me so," confides her own apodo Karel Brézina.
The Current.cz journal tested the number and function.
For their party partners, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yyo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("vijo"), the representative of Miroslav Poche, who was associated before the false elections during the party's patrol, receives the "Igraček" support ("playmobil") from some of his peers.
The contributions are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in the talk within the party.
Hulínský doesn't like it but the newspaper Actualní.cz also discovered other clues to this president pragense.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Poor" seems to remember that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "brujas", as published in a booklet
Women considered to be bulls in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They often have advanced age, they can't work, for example, for health reasons, they're single and they don't have children.
Women who are "reel" widows are sent to an isolated area so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"People rarely suffer so much."
"It is also not easy for healthy young women, because they help in their work and have children," explains a Monja who, in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso is occupied in a special residence of more than a hundred women displaced from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social media".
He issued a leaflet that should help to prevent the wedding.
However, this is a trap.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warns Die Standard newspaper on the disadvantages of written sensitization.
Bribery charges are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gas and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was taken into oil used for rituals.
He was called when the group wanted to "reject the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "brows" supports people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted 42-year-old Burkina Faso as saying: "The human souls spoilers always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is attempting to destroy the castle, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his uncle, launched a broad slaughter of bears which, of course, had been related to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To help you bring it to the names of the nearby Guinean police, military and the president's personal hearing, men and women elected randomly among the Gambian peoples to the president's property in Kanilai," the Amnesty International Organization noted in its report.
In Finland, arrested people had to drink a bottle of herbs with alucinogenic effects that also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrests did not survive the stay in the prison.
After international pressure, about a thousand persons were finally released.
The village of Babala: warms with carbon stairs and sign a higher rent
The man, advanced age and rare, crossed the doors of the center of attention to the client of RPG Byty of the "Crone Magnate" Zdenjek Babala, the largest private owner of the private premises in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm he carried documents with the new rental contracts: his son, his daughter and his son, who is fulfilling judgment.
To the three of them, they were just completing the liberalisation of the rentals.
Instead of 3,500 Czech Koreans per month, the child will pay from the next year 4,100 crowns for a two-stage space with a separate kitchen of the second category.
"In addition, there is no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel tank," the man showed with his finger in his son's new contract, on which the signature has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains a warm, dedicated medium.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which has qualified the new terms of rent as "inaccurate and indisputable", recommends residents who do not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, the date on which a guide will be published informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But before this, the man only makes an evening.
"Everything says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of proof of liberalisation.
After the New Year it will occur with the vast majority of the spaces that, in the Czech Republic, have so far been under a regulated rent.
That's why, currently.cz decided to visit the "laboratorio" in person.
The RPG mineral waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava and, Tuesday to the ninth, was already full.
Just near the doors are security guards and on their side a machine to get a number.
"Aquiler 2011", you can read in a light button on your touchscreen.
When you press it, get out of the machine a paper with a number.
Almost doesn't give time or read "157" and the number is already on the big screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the car.
Shortly thereafter, an advanced age marriage comes to question, but the majority of the room is not here for the new rent.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: arrangements requests, insurance issues and similar issues.
The cards with new rental contracts will be reached in Ostrava to the boroughs of the majority of 44,000 premises belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes an increase in rent from 15 to 38 per cent in the cards.
On 18 November a special window opened at the customer centre for new rentals.
"It's working a week, so it's starting," they answer, after a short doubt, the workers who are in it when the client presents as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old balala mines are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, the vice-president of Parliament, originally of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of ČSSD, had already dealt with them high and clear, and now they are still in the newspapers of the area.
"Seven years later, I want a new soil."
"I didn't change the damn plate of the bathroom," the man mentioned at the introduction disappeared.
According to the workers, there is now more than nothing available to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign in time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
They will also receive half of the discount on the rent of February for the remaining residents who sign the new contract before 15 December.
However, the "liberalization" window of the mine is certainly not able to dissipate the avalanche of doubt.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only asked about the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimates the use of the fan.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties fail to reach an agreement on the rent, an independent judge must resolve the matter.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only way possible and fully in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
"There's no one going to judge here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man who's on the street in front of the customer's attention center gives him at least part of the reason.
"I get 13,000 pensions and I'm left with 5,000 for food; I don't have any means to appeal to the courts," he said.
But immediately, the employee seems to have doubts.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warned them in the media that they didn't sign, so maybe people wait," he said.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rentals still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimesjes, director of the RPG Byty company's residential map, adding that the unscathed state of the community's fund that concerns the residents is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest in four billion apartments, in the four years 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.200 million.
The large screen that closes the roof, facing the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that are highlighted in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and less applies to 3.1,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90 per cent of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be as maximum 7.50 monthly check crowns per square metre," says the screen.
Only increases in a 38% rental of 400 pieces of RPG card.
"In such cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19,66 square-meter-on-mortem crowns," says RPG.
In 2,600 rooms, the rental will remain invariable in the coming year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not affect strikers, but will scale between four and eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent uptake (see the chart) again in the spaces, mainly in storage in heating: new windows and heating.
Those who sign the lease agreement shall have priority.
The architects have understood that the offices also need guards.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that hiding within it would also be a small store with all its own facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park in the outer terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can be brought to her.
The company of architectural projects Arch.Design, whose study released many known buildings from Brno, thought from the first sections of the Avriopoint building to include space for its ministry.
About 90 people work in the company, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to get back to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced time, the store is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to its employees under its social program.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with the care of children.
The Ministry was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the Directorate, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's Ministry of Finance is funded through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a provision of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding is completed (two years), Arch.Design has the obligation to maintain the Ministries with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and the submission of the request for funding contributed to the Economic Rating company.
Children's attention is in the hands of qualified personnel; in addition, they are present all day for their care by a nurse and a professor of the Ministry of Education.
As it is a "minisservatory", it can only be accommodated simultaneously with a maximum of five children, although with the tournaments it is more frequent during the day.
The maintenance operation is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers has the same right to use the guard, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
While individual teaching and care, the content of the ministerial programme is comparable to the program of regular pre-school education.
In it, children not only play, but also receive a quality education: from basic education to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class not only has games and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of getting their children to school later when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is located among companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program has strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of the dogs continues to fascinate after 100 years. They observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the hole of a prehistoric lake, the stairs remember the column of a dinosaur, and the balconys look like the mouth of an open piece.
That's the Batlló House in Barcelona, from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its similar form, the locals helped her "the house of the dogs".
Its organic shapes, its callative colors, the innovative use of stone, the steel and mosaic fragments, a façade that reminds of smoothly curved layers and omnipresenting lines, all of which is typical of Antoni Gaudí's section.
The door of the house plays with unique lines, delicate colors and textures from nature and fashion.
Taking further care, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought order are observed.
During the night, the whole face of the house seems even more impressive, since it is lit in such a way that the light of the colors improves.
Serpentea and the torture of the ways continues to surprise us in its interior as well.
The ondulbed wood copies the frames of the windows, the bathrooms, the doors' decorations, the mirrors and the letters.
The house Batlló, located in the village of Eixample in number 43 of the animated commercial road of Passeig de Gracia, emerged from the remodeling of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The inverter, industrial rich Joseph Batlló, initially insisted on crossing the former building and starting from zero, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Battle House, formed by several apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Joseph María Jujol worked in the design.
In fact, in their project plans, gold rose for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the musicians used in the façade.
Other artists and artists also work on the façade.
Cooperation in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Milá House and the Güell Park of Gaudí, in which other parts of it are located.
Because of its organic shape, the locals soon after their finalization assisted her "the house of dogs".
Others, due to the specific window opening mechanism, began to call it "the house of the woods".
It is also said that at the height of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, the patron of Catalunya, appears.
Other cultural elements of construction hide religious reasons.
Gaudí designed a unique system at home for the central heating season with ventriloquists and typical chemicals.
It can result in extravagance of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not fully respect the construction standards of the time and did not allow for them.
Nevertheless, the construction received the relevant permission from the beginning, although it clearly indicated the data on the planned reconstruction was so empty that, two years after its completion, the merger was so affected by the result that it requested correction.
For example, he worried that the construction would include columns even to the public air.
The arrangements were never carried out, but otherwise: only 15 days after the petition, Joseph Batlló asked (and received) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed in the lower spaces.
In the gallery of the second floor was the living room and in the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The low plant was rented into a jewellery.
The house, of six floors, is completely crossed by a ladder leading to the terrace of the roof.
The basic elements of the reform were to break all right angles and lines, covering curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can be communicated in this way without any problems, without neglecting the privacy required for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only received a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It also results in amazing how Gaudí plays with light, white oils and salts that cover the interior floor and Tragaluces.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light in all the rooms of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which was added in 2005 to the World Heritage List of the United Nations Humanity.
At the first floor of the house is the most spacious and well-furnished apartment of public accessors.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The visits confirmed, or discovered, that it was a very beneficial business and extended visits to the common area and the garden, including the terrace of the roof.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches EUR 16,50, although students, jubilees and tourists get a 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of the entry of other constructions of Gaudí into the city.
If you want to enjoy the true bed environment with your lagarto tours, you should make a quick friend of a neighbor's resident and visit him at home.
How the flock and the winter are selected: women and men are looking for different things
None of a soft frame for the bed; what really entrusts its quality to a good bed is the surface to thicken, that is, the corner and the shade.
First of all, perfection must be complemented in order to be adapted to specific users.
During the election, many elements enter into play, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
It is also important for the type of interior in which the hill and summer are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cab that does not usually have heating, latex hooks should not be used because they "slower" slowly.
In addition, they often weigh significantly more than normal polyurethane beads.
Therefore, it is necessary to give them the most frequent return.
If the channels of the center are not properly aired and, above, are located on a solid base, they keep in moisture. They can even appear low.
At the time of choosing a bed, the customs are also influenced.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high hill with a soft layer and will have problems to feel well on a lower and longer surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who returned from NHL complained that they didn't sleep well here."
"For his machacad hombres, tusks and cassettes, there was a need for balconies with a white viscoelastic layer."
"This type of cough is also recommended for people with diabetes who have time problems with the nervous system, so they get the information from the articles and the skin," explains Sylva Haddamjkova, who specializes in the received furniture.
Many hockey players, like other clients, take time choosing viscoelastic hooks.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these appropriate Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Tropical Czech brand."
It doesn't have to be a NHL player to appreciate viscoelastics anymore.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimize your rigidity and shape according to absorbed heat or adapt to your body heat.
There is no pressure; during the night, it will not give back as after a hard game.
Just keep it going.
Viscoelastics also serve as protection against tears.
When choosing the size of the hill, added to its height the length of its feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room of 90 cm, total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, e.g. singles, it is recommended as a minimum between 120 and 140 cm.
So a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: at the top of the mouth, it should have the hands gently attached to the codes," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čaluníkók a decorataire, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy dream and the ergonomics of the furniture, the subject he teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs its own shade and shade, so during the purchase you need to pay attention to combining the height of the beds.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the shadows at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Spum hooks should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with a minimum of 15 cm in diameter, of which at least three centimetres are for the layer that adapts to shape and softness.
"When you touch it with your hand or you're sitting in your pocket, you should certainly not notice the mussels," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each collection requires a certain type of shadow.
The fully-encumbered bedrooms, in which the roof and the base are like symmetry, have no meaning in the bedroom.
The bones breathe badly and cannot wash their foundation, which is often done today.
And, since each night we switch between 0.2 and 0.75 l of salt, it is clear that after about five or seven years the harvest will begin to remind us of a big (and congested) tamiz.
For this reason, experts reject the slogans that speak of a life of the neck for up to 25 years or, even, of a life-saving guarantee.
However, everything has a pen.
Therefore, the sellers give advice: in the hills with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the ground, but better add a shelter that can easily be removed and washed.
Although it is currently made up of stems with cremary closures throughout its perimeter, so when opening they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and washing size!), their manipulation in larger models (and by one person) when raising the stem may seem like a struggle between a muscle weight and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of a bedroom, do you have a firm table?
Never!
How much for the beds designed to spend one night visiting.
However, you must make (if you don't have them) ventilating outlets on the table and use with a mixture of inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a blended layer.
Polyurethane rings should not be used on such bases.
For non-articular lamps which contain between 14 and 18 lamps, latex or sandwich hooks (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although it is always better a shade with a larger number of lamps, 28 or more, in which lamps in the lamp area are strengthened and their rigidity can be regulated.
Articulable laminates must not be used with a mixture of mussels, since it does not react to recycling.
In addition to the adjustment of the laminate rigidity, protection of men can also be used.
It is a special fixation of lamps that enables you to push or even drag the lamps in such a way as to "rode" the men perfectly during the dream.
For men with very broad shoulders, it's very important.
They are even agreed upon by the coke manufacturers who, in the "masculins", began to use a more dense area specifically around the males.
Women are also agreed upon, for which they place a softer area around the floor.
For the most demanding customers, there are shadows with cross-structure or tables with the so-called amortization multitoration.
Pressure is distributed between different points and reduced tension.
It should also be borne in mind that, while using the suitable balconies and shade, if it uses a bad almohada (great and "mutilla"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the almohada must support the head and the corners can only reach the limbs, so that the muscles of the muscles can rest.
The appropriate size recommended is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
At the top of the side, the almohada must be at the same level (when combined with the shade with strength for hombres or the softest area of the hill) than the height of the hombres.
Modern beads have something to see, it seems, with the original beads filled with leaves.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biokids are fashionable.
The raw materials based on petroleum, with which the polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as rice or soya.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers employ soya.
"Biologic, in the case of collcons, means that the centre is made only of natural materials," explains Petr Vasječek of the Tropico Plus company.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the base of the bees, one of the first true aloes.
But you can also choose from the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to the forest or bath.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "refreshed" with vegetative sprays, so that the base of the neck absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heating" the foundation.
The red pepper extract improves the circulation of blood, so that women feel more warm.
Do you like them right now?
Cold-spouse shells, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, make them more legible than normal polyurethane and provide more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam bands enables the manufacture of hooks from different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and shoulders go.
A high-quality collection will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as sanitation.
The first I got this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's hard to save in the hills and shadows.
Sometimes offers from manufacturers or sellers can be accepted, which at times offer two hooks at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers duofreeze beds with a memory of memory attached to the foundation for 11.990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The age of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a great density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
Initially, it emerged as a material for NASA, because during the disappearances, astronomers were subjected to a huge overload.
Time is spent with heat and it is frozen with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exercises a perfect effect and adapts its pressure optimally.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid tears, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is not only used in the joints, but also for sanitary products, for example for almoids that are placed under the legs and aliviaries, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar foam.
More and more parents use people's tracking devices to control their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, originally designed for the follow-up of vehicles, can also continue the movement of people and contribute, for example, to the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
For the moment the device has the approximate size of a cell box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the case of missing Anička and started to inform about the means available to better protect their children.
Even it cost him his privacy.
"We are all trying to say that it is not about spying, but about another way to reduce the possibility of a tragedy," considers Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices may be abused, for example, if they are put in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet met with such cases."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his view, children should always know what "cajita" is and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that, if the child doesn't want to take it, he'll just shoot it.
"Even younger children show great creativity when they lose intentionally certain things if they want to avoid controlling them."
"In the past, parents were heavily dependent on mobile phones, but they could be removed as easily as the tracking device," Bočková says.
In your opinion, it is possible to discuss whether such device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If this is a prepared dryer, the author will virtually always check whether the child is carrying any type of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As soon as the use of tracking devices is extended, he will also look for them, since his sale will certainly be made with much publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, add that such devices can help in the event of an improvised attack of a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and persons, even if after an attack the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence can serve as help.
"The device may be configured to send the position on a regular basis after a given period."
"If damage occurs, at least it will facilitate the last person's position on the matter."
"The most expensive devices are integrated into an inclimate meter, so if the person is simply rejected and is not mobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Czech.
In your opinion, a service of this type can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which a special software should only be installed.
The problem of the current tracking units is that devices are currently treated with a size similar to a cell box or mobile phones of less size.
So they can lose.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that appear to be digital clocks.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
"What identifies it after a certain time, which can make the police get time," he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried into or attached, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the check of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mechas like to round all Chequia, but only for two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of mecha to take explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence added its 224-kilometre armament.
They are therefore existing for 225 years.
The problem is that the mecha's useful life is two years, four to the sum.
The army bought the mecha for explosives to the STV Group, a.k.a. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNA justifying the purchase of such a huge quantity of mecha, saying that soldiers need 60 kilometres of mecha training per year.
According to the estimates of the army's pyrotechnics, which have been contacted by MF DNES, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, these manoeuvres should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, senior officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exemptions from the Minister of Defence Alexander Vundr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek army.
Only this could be justified that the army spends 60 kilometres of mecha.
That length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient existences for more than ten years.
On the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional to reach a maximum of two mecha meters, the army would have a new purchase (including by adding the consumption of engineering or special units) sufficient existing for the 225 specified above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally shortly before Minister Vondra because they said they only had ammunition for various weapons, so they were limited even to money-related shooting practices.
And we're not talking about the lack of inner clothing.
"I also can't understand that they buy us such amounts of butter again."
"But it's your decision, and they'll know why they're doing this."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Décký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek also defends hundreds of miles of mecha saying that he will have the existence of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group indicates that the mecha has only one useful life for four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, for two years.
"If it is stored under perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one soldier who, because of the possible military criticism, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains faithful and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another of the Ministry's arguments is that when buying 445 kilometres of mecha, I received a discount.
"We had a 60% less than last year's application of 244 kilometers," said the spokesman Pejšek from the Ministry of Defence's shopping centre.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the ammunition of World War II or the loss of Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 metres since.
In addition, the police always only ask for the right amount as to cover the ammunition before it ends its useful life.
They decided it for security reasons for the pyrotechnics and, in addition, while more modern and reliable mecha types can be achieved.
The Ministry has already had clear difficulties ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovakian army of tens of thousands of people were preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics who spoke with MF DNA, after a few years the following problem will be solved with the current: hundreds of miles of old mega, which is now buying "barata".
I'm still living with the contacts I got through the competition.
The fact of winning the competition "Employer of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition won the competition "Employer of the Year" by 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun de Liberec.
His story of success seems to come out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun is just a pleasant trip.
In the foreign country, it was noted that Liberec lacked quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered with fixed works abroad, and a bank loan bought a house that was half the lost composition of five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really valuable.
"At present, the quality-precious relationship of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All incomes that gained the invertery again in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it has been able to gradually open in Liberec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, opened up another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tise, to which we sold our concept of franchise, and other people are showing interest in a Python franchise," said the entrepreneur number one of the last year.
"This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped greatly to win the competition of the 'Employmentor of the Year'," adds Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding areas.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, that it was very pleasant," recalls.
No doubt, he recommends that all the world try to get some company involved in the competition.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that he is still living with contacts and known that, without the competition, he may not have been obtained.
"With some people I knew, thanks to the competition, I started to work together normally."
The fame associated with success, in its opinion, also included in employees,
in total about seventy.
"I have seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that has gained general recognition."
"It's not, not much less, my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"Only my name is what appears in the first plane," says the modest Lukáš Pytloun today.
My successor wants you a more peaceful year than we've had in Farmet.
The euphoria for the victory soon became divided by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the firm Farmet, Karel Žžárský, received the first prize in the final edition of the Vodafone competition "Empresa del year", last year in the "Slave House" of Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he was able to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a volume of hundreds of millions of businesses.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my colleagues and improved our confidence in combating competition," said the winner of last year.
The story of the firm Farmet starts with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to the father of Karel Žžárský the rent of a small trailer as compensation for the loading of property during communism, he did not doubt it too; he gave up his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of associates, founded the company with his father of plastic plates.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetal oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic printing in the centre of Europe.
There was also a greater presence among the non-specialized public after success in the competition in the media.
"Not only did our customers start to view the Farmet brand as significantly better, but foreign partners also started to value collaboration with a company that had achieved a greater success in their country," says Karel Žðárský.
Last year may not have been on Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
I also received recognition for the commercial results until 2008 and, in part, for 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for the machine sale.
The increase in the crisis, which has not yet reached so many citizens, has led companies to stop their investment projects and start to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, are not free from such a situation."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some expeditions," says Karel Žžárský.
A viable company must, on occasion, take even small-scale measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut costs, it was in research and development.
"With the subsidies we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence on the international market and made great assessments in national fairs," says Zžárský.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Zžárský.
An investigation that reveals ridiculous standards
The survey of Absurdez of the year forms part of the fourth time of the business tournament.
Some ridiculous rules have already been removed.
The unknown recipient of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring documents to the administration to which officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than a third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extract from the trade register, although its staff could obtain it with two movements of the rat.
Thanks to the investigation, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of social security will no longer ask for an extract from the trade register when it carries out a control of insurance taxes," said ČSSZ’s spokesman Jana Buranóvá.
The objective of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and businesses in Chequia and to try to eliminate those who are absurd.
This year's fourth-time form is part of the business tournament of the newspaper Homórské News and also begins to create affection among the general public.
While the previous year's edition contained the participation of three thousand voters, this year reached four thousand in practice.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations over which they should simply be respected for trading.
"I would like to see a number of papers necessary for the tax declaration we are in first place worldwide," said Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Enterprises in the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation is particularly improved in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for holding a company, Chequia is in position 74a, i.e., eight jobs worse than last year.
The Absurdez competition for the year was held for the first time in 2006 and each year was repeated in the same way.
Anyone may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.fifiroku.cz. Afterward, the competition organizer selects seven candidates for the "antipremium" and, in October, allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.fifiroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
She wins the absurdity that she receives more votes.
For this year's investigation more than one hundred were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations which do not make sense.
Examples have been sent to both business and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of the roads and buses pay the rent or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held in early November at the Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and social people are often involved.
This year, for example, the Act was attended by Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continues to work for entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate at least thirty paragraphs that currently make trade unnecessary," Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek announced.
Efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations do not remain in drinking water.
In 2007, the most disturbing of the people was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate with the business office in the permanent operating area for three days with the intention of escorting a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed from the new industrial law.
The obligation to make a second vote in 2007, i.e. the communication to the Office of Labour by its foreign workers on labour travel for up to 30 days, was removed from the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is going to win.
Absurdez of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a nurse and two ground bascules in their consultation.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication stating that it had removed the obligation to have a kidney.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of Homórskö noviny’s competition is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The conclusion of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"This is how we want to support businesses that are affected by their environmental activity and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, Regional Director of the Mobile Operator of Vodafone, Organisation and Competition Patrik, as in the case of the Rebellion of the Year.
For this new special subcategories of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's 2010 main competition, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities vary completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is the case of persons with disabilities, in other cases of personal or health problems of employees.
Among the forty finalists of the entire Republic, for example, the company was asked for Et Netera software, which supports the training of informal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in various sports tournaments.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main fund contributor for the care of disabled children for seven years.
In Podébrad, there is a paper that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70 per cent of the plant; therefore, it received the title of the company responsible for the central region of Chequia and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended third place in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, which reduced working hours, even under 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also granted because it was primarily purchased by Czech producers, supported Community activities in the area and respected the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities produce the least possible environmental impact," explains the company Milushé Ryznarová.
The IT company in charge of the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them a chair and ergonomic keyboards; it also supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Becca Persona in ampuros, which helps specifically the local Roma community," said the representative of the company Ondréj Suchý.
It also takes place in a good place with a mention of the Praní laundry company and cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive special benefits that affect their pension funds.
"We benefit from food, transport, improvement of qualifications and eight," says Josef Strapáč, from the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, a winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of company responsible for the year, it was automatically assigned to all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it before 15 August to the organizers.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition of a company responsible for the year, but do not qualify for the "principal" competition Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual applications for this competition are not allowed, since it is a subcategories of the company's main competition of the year," says Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultant.
The police carried out arrests during a public strike in the building of the Agricultural Fund in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police carried out several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in recent days.
The detectives married a local media and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public substation for the restoration of rights in such a way that the subsidized land receives an appropriate interest.
I should have paid Luboš G. half a million crowns for that.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person by surprise during a public interview and a public bid," said Pravo, chief of Pilsen Antonie Zelená's general prosecutor, adding that at the time it cannot reveal more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police left the company for 46 years.
On how I could influence the public summit, given the little official information, it can only be expressed.
The spokesman of the Agricultural Fund Lubomíra Černá responded to the questions of Pravo saying that the police had actually taken the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and it was during a public hearing.
"It's a client, not one of our employees," he said.
According to Černá, the public summit is called "Convocationary for submission of proposals for land transfer in accordance with the Land Act" and is conducted when several interested parties are present in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their return, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the tenders, the order of the buyers is determined, and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the biggest offer," explained the Fund's portal.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be presented to the call and, since he was an interested person, because he had acquired several rights of return, proposed to the parties in the land that would not participate in the substation.
Please, it was covering a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, there was so much money up there.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was the case of the former chief of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of depleting the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
Luboš G., for example, has just received from the Fund some land intended for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the area where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Then he changed them in a very beneficial way with the judge by a house in the city’s own historic center with a very high value.
In this case, the alliance had to intervene because, otherwise, blocked areas would avoid construction.
Families should pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Houses will have to pay since January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
As a result, families will have to get out of the map, from January to January, several hundred crowns per month more than now.
The electricity price increases by 4.6 per cent, the gas around 2 per cent, in some cities it is expected to pay up to 10 per cent more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns over the year now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices due to increased support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaic.
However, gas is moderate, especially at the time when heating is used more and, therefore, more is consumption.
In this case, they should also count with a couple of hundreds of crowns more than a year.
While electricity and gas are all around the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The price rise is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Kralové will be paid from January for central heating some 50 crowns per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
Residents in Prague should also support an increase of 9 per cent of the water price and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the price will be 6.8% additional.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the country.
In the north of Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be charged at 7.4 per cent.
The prices of renting 450,000 rented rooms in Prague can be significantly increased, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which owns in Ustí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company shall bring to courts those who do not agree with the new rent.
Regular rentals, which benefit residents of about 300,000 rooms, could increase the year by up to 10%.
Young Czechs get dressed with Fernet and iron. The beer is no longer fashionable, because it works slowly.
Fernet, iron, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen to their parents.
These are the drinks that lead to the end of young alcoholic medical care with a minimum age of five years.
Children who have died in the hospital continually to overcome the trauma are no longer an exception.
This is from the experience of doctors who are in such cases in hospital petition admissions.
"Drink beer wine is not fashionable anymore, because they're too late to bury them."
"Now the fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages," he said to Pravo, the head of the hospital's petition at the centre of Bohemia, Ludék Pelikán.
"When they get to take a bottle to their father from the balcony, it can be whisky, but normally it's Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it is associated with soup and that it doesn't smell so much," he explains.
He also confirmed the portfolio of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's often about Fernet or the crown."
"These are modern alcoholic drinks, especially among students."
"In some cases, they use waiting for you to get home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, those who often appear in hospitals have been drinking for three and a half years.
Before Horrovic, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in the Paediatricia in Motol, where the ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when it was brought with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor of the department said about this case.
"I was in Holešovice's party at some dance party."
"It's interesting that his mother didn't surprise him that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours," the chief surprised.
It is precisely the lack of parental interest or even its clear tolerance for drinking by their children, which is considered the main cause of increasing the consumption of alcohol among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of self-dependence.
"It is understood by alcohol to a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which is not produced in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains chief Pelikán.
According to the porter Jurinová, this year in Motol’s paediatric clinic, up to mid-November, forty Hebrew children were hospitalized.
However, statistics show only those who experience serious intoxication and must remain in the hospital.
Babies who go home with their parents or with the police, after medical recognition, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and are drunk, there are three high stations for Pelikán to mention: the day of the wedding, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink by bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of holidays."
"On the day of the storm I came to see seven Hebrew children at once," Pelikán adds.
Babies who spend the night in decontamination under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible burden at home.
The pain of the morning head, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a sorceress with glucose and by nutrients that are missing from the body.
"These take it much better, because after the night's attack, they get up well and don't hurt anything."
"Only confusion about where they are is shown," Pelikán notes, adding that patients often lose good humor at least when they see the costs they have generated.
Ambulatory transfer and hospitalization in a room for severe patients cost a dozen thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children exactly how much their pregnancy cost and that they would have to spend the entire summer in a job for young people so you can earn enough to pay that night," Pelikán adds.
Medical insurance, in your opinion, may be a regressive measure, which often restores the costs of treatment to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 planes are first found in hands in Spain
Two L-159 of a total of five planes, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced House C-295M, left Tuesday for Sevilla, where the manufacturer of the House - EADS aircraft is located.
It's the first time a device of this kind is in the hands of someone who's not the Czech army.
For the moment, they were only abroad to carry out practical or demonstration flights.
This is the version L-159T1, which has so far been used by the Czech army and is still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 monoplaza.
These are still stored in Air Vodochody and the sales intermediary, Omnipol, already charged with them last week.
Jan Pejesk, of the Department of Defence Press, indicates that it is still unknown when the physical aircraft will be withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 monoplaza aircraft, in turn, were separated from the aircraft repaired over time, without additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplazas were exchanged into their current state," said Pravo Pejšek.
He added that the army was not left without biplaza aircraft, since in May 2009, the army signed a contract with Air Vodochody for a total of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 non-required Biplaza devices.
One of the new aircraft has already received the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS was committed to the addition of aircraft to the equipment of some associated countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that the EADS company is the one to withdraw L-159 aircraft and will serve for the pilots of NATO countries."
"Therefore, it is up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this frame," notes Pejšek.
The newspaper Homårskö newspaper published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a house and the purchase of three other aircraft by 3,500 million crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for an invitation to purchase and negotiate directly with EADS.
The current defence direction states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 to the foreign country.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft and only used 24, so he wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of planes Home is likely to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already complained to the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by making a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three planes Home and the last should arrive at Kbely's beach airport in forty days.
A long-term indexer indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index that the cancellation is subject to a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published in a British magazine on cancer.
They could depend on testosterone level, male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men with up to 60 years of age," said Professor Ross Eeles of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine what men should be subjected to a test of prostate cancer, in particular if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Heels.
During the period 1994-2009, a British homologous followed by more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, at the same time, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indic finger of the right hand shorter than the one on the right.
They presented the same probability of suffering prostate cancer as 19 per cent of those whose teeth were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the cancellation finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men with less than 60 per cent age, the reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones that are present in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that it does not appear to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "exactly demonstrated".
The Czech Republic under nine: D1 and D5 are closed
Chequia, like most of Europe, hosted the winter covered with snow.
The roads and steels are mainly covered by compact snow, and the quitive machines traveled all night through many areas.
In the morning, the road D5 was closed between 89 and 93 kilometers towards Rozwadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, such as the D1 in Brno, heading to Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Central Autobot Club (UAMK).
In the square mile 91 there was a truck, in 93 two industrial vehicles were shot that caused injuries.
Several tourists have also ended up in the kitchen.
There are also problems on the D1 road in the 185 km towards Prague.
There they shot two trucks.
Drivers must slowly travel behind Brno in 190 kilometers or cross Brno and enter 182 kilometers in Kývalce.
A couple of miles have been formed there.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 road just along Prague.
Prague is covered by a cloud layer of several centimetres and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
They are forming attachments for example in Prosek, although they are also congested in Štérboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tranvias circle with a delay, for example on the line between Karlovo and Nämstí Míru.
At eight in the morning another crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airports.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three speeds.
The problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
The Rusiné airport closed from midnight to Friday morning.
Currently, it can be traveled by most of the streets of southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed, Brnänska is forming snow languages, and Blanenska needs chains to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Up to now the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatice - Milesovice.
They'll need fresheners to take care of them.
At the moment you can't say when you're going to open up to the circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathy (white Carpathies).
The roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, should simply be left in the inert state, are collected up to five centimetres of snow, according to ČTK.
In Chequia they fell between two and ten centimetres of snow, mostly in the north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimetres.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimetres of snow fell.
Nevadas gradually resume in Chequia.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the moment only by coded XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "following the progress of the game" would make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely accurate score.
His balls are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The 25 mm high calibre munition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that contains causes it to actually work as a small granite.
Projects can be programmed to operate not only when they hit the target but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind a barrier, a wall or a triangle.
Of course, no normal protection can be used, and when its rain kills metal steel, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon for childhood using a "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to their laser beam, which determines the distance, then get a precise point of view, and, depending on it, corrects the line of design, and takes the trigger."
"Let's say that 543 meters have been measured."
"When the gun is pressed, the weapon is loaded and launched the projectile at a distance of 543 metres, less than one, two or three metres," Audette says.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu Consortium transferred its branch to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their previous office building at the Marinebader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Consortium Fujitsu transferred its branch to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As announced by the director of the computerized sector and its maintenance, 400 men and women will be transferred in July from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on the Lyon Straße street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
One porter from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, more than 100 other employees of the Consortium, which were previously divided by the region, will be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the collective office in Astro Park will promote how to work with employees.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only resident in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The bright connection with the airport is very important at present for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new change of an important company in the region brought joy to those who were in favour and disappointment to those who were opposed.
The head of Frankfurt Economics, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this has resulted in a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent recognition to the location".
Fujitsu is located in the city, the settlement is a great impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The direction first informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
In the end and in the end, economic reasons led to the fall.
In this way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous place.
"I hope that the owner and the builder of the building will be cooperative."
The former furniture used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the nearby "Pleine Vertical" were part of the most elaborate buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project in the city of the Ballenary.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the merger, a new entry into the city is being made, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that was previously used as parking spaces and the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment council and tax companies were installed, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, and then Siemens joined the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was purchased by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Consortium, originating in Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest international supplier of IT.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides specific services.
The Rhein-Main-Gebiet branch is one of the largest in Germany, in all ways Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions branch is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following branches in this area will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in Astro Park's office building.
The old complex of the next twenty years, its name extends to its plan in a star form, it is hosted among others by the central electronic association and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Threats against Assange
The anxiety is supported more and more by Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the display platform from your server.
Political pressure may be behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, seems to be detained in England.
Wikileaks' revelation platform is always the whiteness of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet heritage in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman calls other countries and companies to Wikileaks' book.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on the list of people looking for Interpol, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wickileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations by means of the Twitter message service the Wednesday (local time).
Earlier, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks' documents from its server.
Internet activists have resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon web of services in order to address the high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfectly, we're going to make our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using his server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, reported the CNN chain on a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Council for the security of the country had threatened Amazon with boutiquet, told British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take these measures before, before the previous publications of information classified through Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unconsidered, and illegal process is playing our national security and endangers life in the world," he said in a communication from the independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with their service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is found in Sweden for suspected rape, is on the list of people looking for Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", a 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has consistently qualified the research in Sweden as a trap of his enemy.
The spokesman for Wikileaks, Kristinn Hraffsson, said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's security, said Hraffsson.
Therefore, the location of Wikileaks' founder remains undiscovered.
Hraffsson has obviously responded to North American statements.
In America, the former republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that Wikileak's disclosures must be judged by betrayal and executed.
In Canada, a director of government Stephen Harper stated clearly with irony on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use a drone.
Between the White House and Assange there is a great deal of controversy.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman of American President Barack Obama, qualified as "frequency and absurd" that Assange has requested the resignation of the State Secretary, in the event that it is responsible for recently ordering diplomats involved in spying.
"I'm not quite sure why we should be interested in the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The US Government must demonstrate the effectiveness of its data base protection in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the National Centre for the Distribution of Terrorism, was appointed exceptional, announced the White House.
That is why Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks' filtering.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as to change the full information on the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to protect the safety of dissidents and activists, Wikileak's publication must be put at risk.
"We have done our best to contact them," said the spokesman of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Healing
In the "Gelato University" in Bolonia, heroes are being prepared in the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future heroes has the greatest influence and visitors all over the world.
In fact, where does all the ice come from?
From gelatium and gelatium.
The gelatier produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of the production of ice cream.
The gelaio pulls out with a spatula the cream of the shower's ice cream, extends it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola del'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream, I shouldn't visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian Carpigian company.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of heating with the refrigerator in 2003, so that the heating cream of his machinery meets the Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future heroes has the greatest influence and visitors all over the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate ice and practices in the home Helder.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others get into the mild heat of their vain desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia, passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and wants to offer a European quality product in the soil of industrial heat.
Also, from Berlin, he is a business consultant and wants to create something for himself in a few years within an exciting job.
Two Egyptian youths dream of opening a cave in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice creams of his bars, and a Canadian home lover, Julia, comes because their children like Italian ice creams.
The hero teacher Luciano Ferrari later explained to the participants the ideal qualities of perfect ice.
It is not only its good taste but also its sedative susceptibility and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the birth cover of the national top house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice is simply the best, and that is why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the development seems to be easy.
Luciano and the basic ingredients: milk, baby, powder milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large beater, which warms everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the same time cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the engine gryphon and release a pasteurized white basic cream, the base for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can some tastes of experimentation be given?
Luciano warns that they will abandon the trends of the day.
What it speaks of ice "not only of natural ingredients", it has best used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably rubber rubber, of frijol guar.
Of course it can be made without a stabilizer, it is only necessary to buy it one day, put it in a bag, and the customer will smell a smooth sound of granite.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
That job's nice.
As for the taste of ice cream, the Lucian teacher distinguishes among ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are dust and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to collect flavoured ingredients in their merchandise."
"But they have to experiment sometimes."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with powdered cocoa as the basis for all possible chocolate tastes.
Now the participants in the course can use the heaters.
Luciano lets you produce four different types of venilla ice, chocolate, moca and apple, with or without eggs in the basic table, with more or less a aroma of venilla or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice.
To know better does not necessarily depend on having more tofu aroma or pure fruit.
It is not necessary to separate the eels from dried fruits, if they contain more eels.
The working group develops the lyde of kiwi, which uses more fruit, less water and less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice, says Luciano.
The preparation of ice cream is an artimetic problem: The pure melocotton is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar from the basic recipe needs to be reduced.
For lemon ice, an extra sugar portion is needed.
Luciano brings out a utility with which to determine the amount of sugar of the fruit-types (medication of the wine-cooker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easy.
Making ice cream requires more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the tool for the automatic development of the basic mass.
There is also a utility, in which the heat mixture is combined, prepared and cooled at zero temperature.
Despite all of this, all automation remains outside the small pasta.
Brazilian Gustavo misses himself and his companions down with fruit pure, as if it were a giant minimist without control.
"In all courses," says the teacher Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that's going on."
Inspectors in a complex situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry that experiments with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently being formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
"There's a conspiracy theory, but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Thenn, director of Testbiotech, the miracle in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, director of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert has also been hired for years in the Ilsi Association.
Consortions like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly collaborated in Efsa genetically modified plant testing standards, which is in a clear conflict of interests, critical of Thenn.
The Efsa provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It's the second time Testbiotech criticises a coalition of interests.
Thus, shortly ago, an Efsa high-ranking manager was without support or time for transition to the Swiss Agrarkoncern Syngenta, and changed with that.
A short time ago, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Environment Office as well as by a clear EU parliamentarian.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, should be of high quality and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Ephesus are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But these contacts must be exposed.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for the risk assessment of biotechnology without Lobby's responsibility.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not checked.
"We want to know what, for example, does genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If the risks aren't searched, how are they going to be found?" asked the accused, then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
Science has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly attempting to influence or discredit critical scientists in the United States and Europe.
So there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For businesses, critical studies are not generally published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck continued.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell's got some, total of about 400 pounds.
The moon was in front of the Stutgart station, with the Tuba on the back.
Hubo Displays
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to cross a large hole in the northern valley.
The country of Stuttgart never again became the same: Thousands and thousands appeared against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As I was getting ready, most of the hall was torn apart.
Roto in 6,000, 7,000 feet.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a yellow stone raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
They are excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he oiled the smoke of cigarettes.
Still don't know what to do with the trolleys.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The footsteps of the stones of Stuttgart led to a forest in Tubingen in a previous warehouse of the French Armada, where Manuel Rongen raised his stone Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"They'd be ashamed, they'd mollify the grave or send it to the bass," he said in his office, a wooden case that once was a guard case.
They insulted him and threatened him, explaining when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the rest of the northern village to the wasteland company.
He talked to 21S' enemies for several days.
And he explained that he couldn't do anything about it.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 S21 enemies took 80 kilograms cut, with a price of €6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also with the hope of being able to return it to a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a while.
Owner of gardens, landscaper, project manager.
They came from all sides and carried what they could carry on the suitcase and up.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He climbs all over his territory, making a tour of his great 20 acres [20 ha] kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a lover of stones.
Locate 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures all over Germany.
It's said to be the country's oldest stone dealer.
I'm sorry, Frana.
In the snow there are artificial sandy stones.
"They took part in the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
Chazza white, yellow, cold, if you're excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosss the forest.
Marks a coin: Red Arenisca, an earlier hole at the Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Good to meet you."
In the past, the mazos belonged to the Neckarstadion Court of Stuttgart.
For all parts of the snow, stones and history, they transformed yellow from Stuttgart's police headquarters, red granite from the church Sankt Blasien, room of Heilbronner's hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he was hiding the stones before and moved them with a simple device and a road, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something was destroyed."
It has not been made rich, absolutely enormously rich.
But today 14 people said to make the stone processor, as well as songs, a sculptor, a hero, a glassmaker and a gardener have been installed up in the forest.
"We worked hard, but it's satisfying," says the man who is responsible for taking advantage of the rest.
You've got to go to Colonia in a while.
There are also stones to save.
Fighting for talent around great potentials
I'm making an active appeal in the buffet.
16 students are wrapped around the pants, the tomato soup and the sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the manufacturer of Vokswagen cars have invited students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a kind of competition, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
In the same way, many companies, like VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Your mission: Contract as many as before to students with more talent from universities, before they enter the labour market and be hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, they try to attract exceptional talent in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of the project at Braunscheig Technical University, the Consortium wins the talent.
A lady from the staff department shares boligraphs, gomitas and folders with VW logo.
Illustrating young talented people explain the program of practice and work for students and show them their ways in the Consortium.
Nico Sele of Braunschweig Technical University takes the project with VW.
See benefits for both sides: "The students are in contact with the industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe more closely the interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Sele, are not very common.
The news is that students want to be so directly.
"The main point was previously found in technical projects," says Sele.
The struggle for fresh degrees is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If they don't have to announce and, above all, to get a highly qualified working hand.
All students of engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI) for its engines in Germany, there were 40,000 vacancies in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audition and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the talent hunt.
It organises expensive procurement events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern chican, where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the United States next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG branches and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two selection rounds on the exit.
Only the cream of many participants goes to the U.S.
The universities are increasingly striving to choose and cleanse the higher potential of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple trajectory only if we were short."
For the catalytics Dykta the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some find themselves close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach to the campus, they are also at home, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their jobs.
"We're trying to get students in specialized parties."
"Something on Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, staffed for the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently there are 35 vacant posts on the company's website.
"It's very difficult to fill the vacancies."
"This is a long time and money," he says.
A shorter route is the contact with university professors.
Solarworld works with several higher schools, for example the University of Freiberg.
"The teachers advise that they can practice with us or perform their thesis.
There are no advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, lake hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A great corporation can usually not offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for employment, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decision-making factors are flexible working hours, child assistance or good access to education.
According to a study of the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld hosts the square 55 among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute prepares an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For the question of the employee, I am satisfied that he is working and with the environment in the same way and that he observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staffing also expects extra points in its classification by their entrants to work.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly placed in the external classifications of an employer's potential," he said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want a long-term strategy that wins a good reputation as employees.
Tell your customers more about it.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as an employer passes by the employees themselves," he says.
In the corner of the sector is called Internal Employment Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the own plant.
"Some satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When it is good for people and they identify it with the company, then direct promotion is made to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a pandilla game," says Kriegler.
Obama has new oil perforations
From the coast of the United States of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil perforation has appeared in these years.
The Washington Government issued a consistent ban and thereby abandoned its previous plans in an irrevocable manner.
New perforations seen from the moment also remain in front of the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by the interior minister, Ken Salazar, the mayor.
The result of this strict ban, which will be at least five years old, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the tragedy that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The parties wanted to reduce the US dependence on new foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it has not been clarified who is responsible for the inadvertent black sea in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will submit its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, raised the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, different petroleum compounds submitted applications for new perforation attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new disaster using more difficult controls and stricter security regulations.
At present, the responsible control authority, which has been accused of corruption charges, has fallen into misdemeanour, is reforming root.
Obama announces in parallel that the lucrative tax chains will be closed for oil and gas consortions.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction of golf will be less due to a more strict regulation, up to date.
"The government plans are the most urgent for the growth of oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey carried out by the BDO advisory company - before the ban on the extraction of mercury.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are being extended soon, in the wake of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil oil as a gasliner: Millions of litres of raw water have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogonlandia.
People live in slavery, corruption and illegal oil trade.
It looks good in Celestine Akpobari.
"Don't smoke them," the environmental activist reassured journalists: "Today there will be enough oil in your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been able to photograph boys walking in the water to the close with the light of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the coloured water light, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It's not seen that on the surface, they're floating out of oil marbles.
Earlier here he took a bag to put on, explains Esther Badum on the edge of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, liquid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil came to light in the humedy humedal.
The fish of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach full-waters of fish: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogonland, is considered one of the most populated regions in the world.
In the path of the river passage through mandators, extensive isolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a hot marón, which drys its hand into the water, will remove a lot of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark trees of regalize, unfortunately they isolate the palm trees that shock and heat their palm trees.
In vana they are looking for pair bands, as if they were in the Humedal as always: As the outer barrier is closed, a kind of fantastic calm of a previous paradise with oil and gas.
"What's going on here is an ecological battle," says the hurun, Celestine Akpobari. "We have been in constant danger to health."
It's the bile comparison.
The ogoni settlement area has been a total field of battle for over 60 years: the first European explorers have been down here for more than 60 years, the first resistance was organized here in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wawa, later executed, here he had to put his first factory in 1993 because it would be too dangerous for oil workers.
Today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is still prohibited: While there were daily more than two million black bars of gold in the whole Delta region, three times as much as Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of tubes, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the Consortium.
Each two hundred meters above steel platforms as extraordinary sculptures of water: "Natural Trees" were warmly called to the heads of the perforators.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have a total corrosion.
At every moment a headazal fails, Akpobari thinks, then leads a constant oil spill in the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have been converted into 50 years in the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrated, as in the average of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the greatest ecological disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the long-term environmental region will be in charge of it.
While Shell's Consortium and oil-based robots are responsible for more than 90 per cent of pollution, ecologists come to the head to break and to the tubes with escapes such as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applied generally low safety standards in the world, according to scientist Richard Steiner to the 2008 Consortium: Only the tube defaults are "more than a multiple than elsewhere".
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears a full tank of oil under the free sky, figures arise from among the mangroves: they are decomposed and covered with oil.
One of the many barriers, which are sometimes connected to perforations, sometimes left arbitraryly on the ground, flames a fire: a small illegal refinance.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire for hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, the fuel enters through the tubes in the container, later the oil tube drops and finally goes out of the diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel daily: "We bring 34,000 naira", about $22.
The residents of the delta enjoy the lack of fuel in one of Africa’s largest oil-leaving states.
Nigeria only has a single refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just EUR 40 centimetre per litre, illegal heaters can still offer less: thus reducing the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which called the pipeline network that passed through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost in all parts of Niger.
Only a significant part of the provisional raw material stored clearly is illegal: organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military charges, preserve the best part in Aljibes and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considered the debate academia on whether environmental disasters should be better managed by the population or by the flood of production.

Investigators detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a forced landing, researchers found a potential factory failure, which could produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
Kantas Airport wants to ask the engine manufacturer.
The airbus passengers in Kantas, who made an emergency landing early in November, had much more luck than they could imagine: Australian air safety authorities have found a serious safety problem in some A380 engines, warning of a potential factory failure.
The potential defect has complex effects: in a manguit connection, fissures can be caused by fatigue or screaming, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused a "catastrophic failure in the engine".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce with 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among those found in the Kantas-Airbus, there was a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
Australia's airline starts legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a request at Sidney's federal court that would allow more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Kantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident of November's beginning.
In the brand of the engine, parts have been lost and their salt is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gas as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be recovered.
Australian investigators announced that they would perform more security tests for overjumbos with the affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security problem has become sufficiently important as to inform all affected.
After the emergency landing of the Kantas aircraft, the airline maintained its fleet A380 on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its units A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa rejected the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the world's largest passenger plane.
A Nevada across the country provokes traffic chaos
Germany is completely white: From one day to another, it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets the chaos is falling, the trains and the planes fall.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
The winter island of Germany: In almost all the country reached warm temperatures during the night of the Thursday, which has led to the fall in traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 cm thick.
Traffic is very limited in most buses and in many streets.
At the A7 at the time of Flensburg, the victors are constantly operating, removing the new nine once and for all, but they are not ready.
In addition, strong windheads cut off the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects living seas with water level 1.2 metres above its normal level at the coast of the Schleswig-Holsteins Baltic Sea.
In São Tomé and Príncipe, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on national roads and roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimetres of recent snow falling and cold winds and strong forces are responsible for the arrest.
There were many trucks and cars caught during the night.
In Sajonia Anhalt, the police authorities also reported important incidents in the streets.
In the A2, the snow and wind paralleled traffic and created assaults.
In Turingia nevadas affected both A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Sajonia, Sajonia Anhalt, Turingia and north of Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the fallen trees on the roads or the destroyed cathedral and the caves are the main problems.
In Sajonia, Leipzig Interurban Service is suspended in Nuremberg.
In Saafeld, Turingia had an ICE train to stop her trip to Munich.
The bombers and the rescue service provided 165 passengers on the train with lunch, food and drink.
The winds with snow are breaking the streets.
In Germany’s largest airport, snow winds caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesman from the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport porter, 40 flights have already been canceled.
Wastes are in continuous operation.
However, there are a few passengers in the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
In many ways, the Wednesday morning was already a lot of accidents.
In the afternoon a truck fell into a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The machine suffered mild wounds.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred due to the snowy streets: a truck was also reached on a road crossing because the vehicle was abandoned.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, Bayreuth's journey to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason by morning.
He also lost a 30-year-old woman, after giving her car back to Aschaffenburg on a rebalancing road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be more soft and softer and therefore it will be remodeled in soft roots.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
No doubt it will continue to make much cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Desche Bank looking for a buyer for his Gemela torrents
The Deutsche Bank wants to be separated from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could bring up to EUR 500 million.
Recently, Deutschen Bank set up its headquarters: The Gemal Towers were modernized in Frankfurt's banking district; while the bankers returned to their former workplace.
But now the financial corporation seems to want to profit from the cost of recovery, and look for a buyer for the two cuts, as the Financial Times Deutschland claims, based on a portfolio.
The carrier does not specify the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always checked whether property should be owned or sold and then rent it again," he said.
As a result, Germany's largest credit institution reassembles its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the Gemal Towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a home fund and then implemented the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached a figure of about 200 million euros.
A sale would provide a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area estimate the value of the periodical torrents named "Greentowers" in around 500 million euros.
If the refurbished buildings are sold in a bank fund or an independent investor has not been disclosed at the moment, he confirmed the portfolio.
Thousands of people fighting for miners lost
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought about buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, the graves have not been found, as security measures continue to be in the place of poverty.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between 17 and 62 years of age were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced in the place of degradation, but it did not detect any sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to fall for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts found that there was no possibility that miners had survived.
The bodies could not be recovered until the date.
Family and friends are currently reminded of the missing with a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplendent light of the sun in Greymouth on the south-east island of New Zealand.
Keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of buried miners, 29 tables were placed with miners' helmets, lamps and names.
There were also photographs and personal items, under suit and surfboards.
Bands went to the middle of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand expected miners to return to the area "from the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the Dutch government, to the participants in the memorial act.
"But they never came home."
He can't take his son's death until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
In addition to the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the memorial act.
In the first explosion on 19 November, mines of British and South Africa were also buried.
Rescue workers began to excavate a fire inside the coal mine on the island of South New Zealand.
As explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures within the mine will begin to decline, declared Gary Knowles, the top of the police, to journalists.
The devil, the warrior!
Does the gorilla fit in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn reexamines the gender boundaries with his "Wallallalla Rising" battles.
What will the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in the audience when he rounds "Wallalla Rising"?
A Vikingo warrior captured with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees his torturers and kills his enemies with almost overhuman fights, ideal sound for young spectators who seek blood-threatening action, precisely because our hero likes him to use brutal methods to kill and get his enemies the bodies of his body alive when he is in bad mood.
On the other hand, the Union, as it is called in fact, does not say almost any words during the entire film and the other characters are left to carry as much one or two phrases or a pair of painful death screams.
On the contrary, they hide and enjoy the beautiful and terrible mountain landscapes of Scotland, which Baptists offer to the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
More ideal for growing and interested cinematographs in existentialism and very quiet camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients, it is a shame that they cannot be decommissioned mutatis mutatis mutandis.
The director Winding Refn considers his lifesaver and his trilogy on the drug trafficking plague "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he is reluctant to make his works for all the public with something more humor in the main stream or something less brutal of the artistic home.
A brain mass and a bunch of trophies cannot discourage most of the followers of the artistic film.
Most of the fans of the action die of frustration, if they take a ship to Jerusalem with a group of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons, and an eternity of peace and snow falls before their team reaches America and is back there.
It's a joke that "Wallalla Rising" has not found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It's a mess against the magnificent images, but also because, after the budgeting and bleeding façade, a piece of movie is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film isn't about dialogues or a logical action, it's all atmospheric, a febrile dream transformed into a film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is only a moment of relaxation and its glazing images and the loud sound band make him naked in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a small young ruby, who loyally supports the Union, preserves something as innocent, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of a single eye, whose reasons are never explained, becomes at any time in a war out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same Devil.
He represents the loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost in any way.
"Wahalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to warm up, change and surprise.
An experience.
Misterior Earth Movements
The OIEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to think on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the average night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli warplanes F-15 and attacked a mysterious Cuban building in Syria.
It is located in the east of Euphrates; the nearest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IEA), which is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that flows from the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the very suitable nearby El-Kibar for the production of plutonium, which builds nuclear weapons.
Instead, the technique serves only for other purposes than for those of the fifty years.
The CIA showed a video presentation with broken satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from nearby or from inside.
A short time ago the reactor was operating, he says, but he was still not equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later of the bombing, it's only known that by then, the enigmas were made bigger with time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the CIA attack, it was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in El Kibar, but that he only saw indications that there would be a "nuclear-weapon programme" in the country.
In Europe, several Secret Service agents prefer to be more cautious and speak only of a "suppressed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plassible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the OIEA.
When he was asked what he was sure to have in front of a reactor, a senior UN diplomat replied in a paper-based way that the IAEA had "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly disappeared from the alleged "unusual military building" and spread the land to consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an OIEA team under the command of former Inspector General Olli Heinonen found uranium cracks in El-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the OIEA received satellite images of a Member State, of commercial sellers right after the attack, who must have a higher information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the OIEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always understood that he had never had a secret nuclear programme nor built any reactor.
The uranium was the Israeli weapon, Damaskus explained.
The OIEA rejected it as inverossimil after analysis of particles.
Since then, Damascus has been refused to discuss the matter in the same way as with satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from having a second inspection at the Kibar and entry into the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also maintains a strict silence.
"We will never comment on it," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently confirmed the official position at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not produced results since June 2008 and "is progressively transformed into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a high-level Western diplomat in Vienna corresponds to a place in the OIEA, which is ultimately a serious offence against the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, by which the OIEA sees it.
The OIEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarifying, which must be "functional" with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
The inspectors have not been publicly informed until the time when the teams are dealt with, what functions they have, or if they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the OIEA has designated Marj as the interior of Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah, again derived from the vicinity of the cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Perhaps located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria therefore prohibits access to the three locations to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians are afraid of a record that the U.S. have asked the OIEA to spread military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert to the equipment due to the United States Secretary-General's warnings.
Through satellite photos, the OIEA has indications that material is transferred between the three locations and the cube at the source of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high position in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams could be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "no indication of sensitive activities", nor of the richness of uranium or reconditioning; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor acts with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium should be subsequently separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, in the best of cases, positive assumptions.
There is no doubt whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are found in the three places.
As hundreds of land trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the mines remain.
The OIAE considers that the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, was recognized by the Syrians in 1998 as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, associated her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the photos from the orbit show that the Syrians carried out land movements in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the OIEA requested entry.
It may be coincidence but only helps to resolve the suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has been using several months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians will allow, in order to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor had already been destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, since a few months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, storms the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means the nuclear authorities will have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, director of the IAEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but still empty.
This road is very narrow: most of the IAEA governance council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious about a scale.
On the other hand, as a diplomat thought, "What happens if they finally find nothing?"
Love in War Times
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her start still unnamed.
She herself wrote the script, a history of love between a Bosnia and a Serb.
It is not known much more about this, but this is enough for agitation.
The noise is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, loves her Serbian rapist during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, with which they have recently moved some days of planned rounding in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been round in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victim organization wrote to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Ambassador.
It's not diplomatic, women offered him a meeting in Hungary last week that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no stories of love in the fields of violence, and Jolie's position in this regard deplores the victims enough on the guide.
His organization, in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as Ambassador, inform the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who read the script, gave after a shot and demanded permission to write in Sarajevo, is not quite clear why Jolie wasn't in spite of everything.
The young author repeats that he does not pursue political purposes with his film, he makes a lot of effort in the Yugoslavian conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and vote to all the parties involved.
Its contents remain unclear.
In the network surrounds a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the start of the war and they meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian field where he works as a guard.
What sounds very different is the variable "violence victim is in love with torture".
I'm sure Jolie's film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unjust and based on misinformation".
You can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the guide remains in the network illegally, as many others have previously.
Nothing like far away from here
This evening at last is again good for the Irish.
No trace of distress
Instead, the household team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans cry out with joy as the music goes back, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in Southland Cork, because the players launch, and find, pingpong balls on the beer vessels from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros more than a plane ticket to Las Vegas for the world champion of beerpong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type, this strange drink game and the software intelligence actually don't make good jokes.
And the 26-year-old boy is trying to have fun with that, to be distracted by the grueling question, what will happen to him in the future.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in its plans, and in January it will perform a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presentation," he says.
"It's very far from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: Your bride waits for her in Auckland, "from a shot she got the job of her dreams as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and crying.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three brothers have already found happiness abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin is currently working as a IT consultant in London.
Young people go: In the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predicting economic experts and the Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
Up to 2015 200,000 immigrants are accounted for.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Pronoses are confirmed, a migration island is comparable to what it suffered on the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that has brought great benefits to the Irish people, the melancholy is currently extended.
The economic crisis is particularly confusing to young Irish well-formed people, for whom it has so far been high.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under thirty years of age are in prison.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director in a mass of young migrants, who complain, "In Ireland everything is deep."
"There should be a rise against politicians and banks, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and with it to a whole generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Student Union, will appear in the future because the government is only devoted to mountains and no longer offers prospects for the future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have strategies to achieve new jobs," says 20-year-old girl.
Note how their partners come from non-reimbursed practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is to have to immigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressive."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a party that offers a service around the subject of working abroad.
"To those who start working, doing it abroad is a great opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," the manager says.
On her website pictures of a boy practicing surf in Australia and of others practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, if it does not bring freedom and fun.
Since about half a year ago, Sean O'Donovan knows how to build something else.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish partners in construction in Germany.
Now they're raising a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he went to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works extra hours so he can pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as it was a long time ago that he pushed the threshold of his house.
"Gano money in Germany for a home in Ireland, where I've never been so good."
It smells something ashamed and goes for warm rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with gardening care in front of the houses, the entrance is equipped with large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for EUR 380.000, 100 per cent financed by a credit.
"There were times of crazy, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with credit?
O'Donovan thinks of a rat, serves more hot and says, "I don't have children to eat and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from zero."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears at present.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with many differences, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working for a while abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with it we feel for the first time as Irish."
He is laughing and counting on his father, who was in England during the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes ideas.
To leave the future and simply to see what life is on the other side.
He's been working for a few years in London. Why didn't he go well with him and his bride in New Zealand?
But in these days, there is something that worries you about over-morning: the celebration of your 27th birthdays in Dublin.
I'm afraid I can get into a waste party.
"Only, not too much emotions," he says and gives a big hand to his brain.
"Dissed, sound very anxious."
"We better call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
The support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private enterprises, is increasing.
Crime generates more concern than unemployment.
In addition, in most parts of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows for follow-up to the change of attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, held in September and early October, highlighted two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humor in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries at the coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a 40 per cent reduction in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a large decline in production last year.
However, only half of Mexico and Brazil's respondents, the two most popular countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44 per cent of the respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but significantly higher than 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted in the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as in both cases, but significantly higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries have only been affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin American people living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has been reduced to 32 per cent this year.)
However, the state of the soul varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and has increased violent crimes.
For the second time since the investigation began, the most investigated in Latin America mentioned crime instead of unemployment as the most serious problem facing her country (see Figure 5).
Around 31 per cent claim that, whether they or a close relative, has been a victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent of the last year and is the lowest percentage registered since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private companies are essential for development, while only 56 per cent were in 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of Venezuela's respondents agree (and 80% support private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is exploding many private companies.
Brazil is the country that has a greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of the respondents (18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent versus 11 per cent last year).
However, the United States is the most influential country in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela holds such title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went far worse than the foreigners who tried to help the country cope with their problems.
Votes were introduced in the Urns, some people voted several times, papers taken in the canals, destroyed electoral colleges and intimidation acts.
The electoral colleges opened with hours of delay.
A number of Haitians, including groups displaced by the earthquake in January, walked through the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were given for victory.
A dozen candidates to the presidentials, including several of the most popular, accused fraud and requested the cancellation of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, United Nations senior United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observer for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, with caution, that "we do not think that these irregularities, for serious reasons, are necessarily invalidating the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which, according to its opponents, is committed to René Préval, the impressive outgoing president, and its candidate, Jude Celestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
It is expected that the discharge will be carried out in January.
All hopes in relation to the elections have not yet been lost.
The two main candidates for the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, an ex-wife, have withdrawn their initial request for invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Celestin, who only has support, if any, has passed the second round.
In view of the country's epidemic and more than a million survivors of the earthquake still live in stores, a great ban is expected.
At the moment, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so because of an organization's lack.
About 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, have not yet been distributed before the elections.
There's a lot in the game.
Aid donors believe that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, according to it's been patented, the Haitians themselves think so.
Stepping points towards the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity at 20 points, up to 50 per cent, the highest level since her election in 2007.
Despite everything, which can make it a successful campaign for a second mandate in the elections of the coming year will depend on whether clearly affected Mrs. Fernández leaves the intransigence of her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, in this respect, the indications are not final.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to be responsible for economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the custom of drawing up budgets that were infrastructural to tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income on its discretion.
In theory, Ms. Fernández's government lost most of its members in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's fall due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some disparate members of the perionist movement in power have faced Mrs. Fernández.
However, after a catholic session in which a member of the delegation handed a sentence to each other in the face and other Members accused the sovereign government, the Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore be implemented next year, which will provide the President with an even greater margin of action at the time of spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of the unions, are approximately 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who assumed power in 2003 when Argentina was at the edge of the economic collapse, made the growth and reduction of poverty a priority rather than the control of inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and made the INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt to official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and the union leaders.
In addition, its officials claim that they want to limit wage increases in the next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentina agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum of growth achieved with a high level of assessment in 2002.
Perhaps for good reason Mrs. Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the Government reached an agreement with the bonus holders who had refused a forced restructuring prior to the debt that Argentina had not subscribed in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the credible Governments grouped in the Paris Club, which is worth about $6,700 million.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve the supervision of the IMF, as is usually customary.
However, last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the purity of the INDIC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when he has completed his mandate, bearing in mind that he no longer has his husband on his side.
If you do so, you will need to gain the support of the middle class, most of which has been overcome by Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinans return from their summer vacations in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If he wants to win other elections, he will have to decide whether he will give up or not, in peace, many of her husband's policies.
Middle throat for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about her big brother on the other side of the darkness?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the elected, joined the mayors and councillors of five urban districts on 27 November in which the president, Ma Ying-jeu, appeared to be an extensive evaluation.
Mr. Ma himself has become a defender of the feelings of the continent, creating innovative business links, including a free partial trade agreement, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for a while.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party had finished winning three of the five elections to the mayor, it was not possible to get most of the votes.
In its place, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has been motivated by a total independence of Taiwan, has practically obtained 50% of all votes against 45% of KMT.
If the presidents had been, Mr Ma would have been in trouble.
Since its election two years ago, the proportion of votes of its party has decreased by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the PPD affected KMT in associations.
In the elections, typical elements of the Taiwanese elections were seen, including stolen camping trucks and large agglomerations with bandits and light girls riding.
Neither did he fail the mysterious attempt to kill hard.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the honorary president of KMT, was campaigning by one of KMT's candidates the night before the elections.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly at his face, beating him and killing a transgender.
The curious thing is that he couldn't determine whether the man was trying to hurt Lien or win the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, causing suspects about the PPD and causing voters to be attracted by KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent was not addressed in itself.
In its place, the candidates spoke of public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its independence in fact and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, KMT tends to avoid advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging feelings against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
On his part, Mr. Ma said that his policy regarding China had been confirmed that his policy was acceptable to most Taiwanese people.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to subsidize them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to its knees.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Of course, he would like to get political integration too, but the first is the first.
The best is to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to take place.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
The President, between 2000 and 2008, openly urged the explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is trying to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been warmly welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, like His Tseng-chang, who has fulfilled his mandate under Chen.
Now your game is doing everything possible to prove that you can also have relations with Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for the creation of a group of experts that acted as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations could be undertaken without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trust option" to Mr. Ma's precipitated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to present to the presidentials.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the PPD will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
KMT must also carry out a conscience examination.
Mr. Ma's assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity appears to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A KMT portal claims to restructure its office, as well as local equipment.
The major samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese think economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known colonist, "there has been the point of no return."
Names to Grammys: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprising choice in the category of discovering artist.
Act on a president's request, and possibly people will stand in you.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz singer and singer personally selected by President Obama to act at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level appointment in the category Best Artist Revelation.
Bearing in mind that Spalding has been a popular jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Hope", the name you think it should be, but it respects the rules of Grammys which must be an artist who has not taken more than three albums before writing what "determinates the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly a big step forward and, taking into account his mild and pleasant voice style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, fun and Latin rhythms, can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the way to the success of Nora Jones, the closest equivalent to the grammy voters, who have recently focused on the jazz field for this category.
In the remaining categories, the Grammy voters earned respect for the "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent disc that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is the veteronist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and the teclist John Beasley for "Positotly."
Thrombone Shorty, a favorite star in New Orleans and usual guest in "Treme", of HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest is significantly focused on mergers such as Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The saving punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained a worthy recognition in the category of large groups, competed against the great jazz camera of Billy Children Assembly and the always-arrived Dave Holland, whose live album with his nickname, "Paths", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the basilist in his band.
Appointments to Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The nominations in the area of classical music for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The main appointments were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", for piano and orchestra, of five moves, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for the elective orchestra of three moves.
Among those named with links to southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his synphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and starred at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also named by his Mandolin Concerto.
The names of classical music are distributed in three categories covering orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The year's classic producer category includes five named Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Malinson.
The albums for classical music are Bruckner by the Synphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebow Orchestra; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Synphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the Art of the Castrati" by several artists; and "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the Opera category, the names are Berg by "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Love of Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Corro of the Marinesky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers named a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Synphony No 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionally Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graphiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
The Synphony No. 4 of Pärt was released at the Disney Hall in January 2009 at a meeting recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonics, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, for about 30 minutes, is added to "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concert" is named by the instrumental soloist act with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the touch on the Avi Avi Avital, which interpreted the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"The composition with sounds from the Middle East and numerous steps and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, was appointed in the Orchestra function category by directing the Chicago Synphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the noted instrumental soloists are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and Architect Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The names as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic blending category, Soprano Jessee Norman was named by his recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mix in Temécula receives the approval of the Management Committee
The Temécula mix project has received uniform support from the local management committee after more than five hours of public witness, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying that it promotes terrorism and attacks.
However, the members of the committee decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local law and would be impressive from aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or pagans, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the valley of Temcula, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm ashamed."
"Shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only that they speak very high."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who were in favour or against the centre, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"United States no longer exists", read one of the comments.
"It's about another Seed Planet with Mrs. Libertad died in the arena."
"America has fallen."
The plans for the construction of Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including close to the zero zone, in New York, where attacks took place on 11 September 2011.
In the Valley of Temécula, the Imam Mahmoud Harmous has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families spent years with no problems in the Riverside county, but he wanted a greater and better space than the storage that he purchased in a shared property with a water filter system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square feet mix, with a Mediterranean architecture style, would include two mines and raise up to 43 feet.
It would occupy a surface of 4.32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opposers can still appeal the project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-resistant microbiosis raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can be used as an arsenic as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although researchers have discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say that it shows that there are possible ways of life without the main elements that they consider essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"He can grow either with phosphorous or with arsenic."
"That turns it into something very peculiar, although it rarely lacks to be a kind of life-form really 'alienian'," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the online edition of the Thursdays of Science publication.
Since then, there have been six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphate, and oxygen.
However, researchers have found that bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing the phosphorus by the arsenic.
"It makes you plant as much as possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, finding is important for the search for life in different planets of the Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know its aspect.
The study focuses on a microbiological discovery in the Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great speculation on the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
I didn't.
What the discovery "so shows is that in other planetary environments, there may be organisms that use other elements to stimulate their biochemicals and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider necessary for life may not be so tight," said Charles Cockell, the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is innovative because it demonstrates the substitution of one element by one another in biochemical and basic biochemical structure," added Cockell.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Symon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it presents high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphoric are similar from the chemical point of view, so it was estimated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to the phosphorous."
"As a result, it may be difficult for different organisms to distinguish them."
"However, the arsenic is quite different than that so that it doesn't work as well as the phosphorous, so it comes in and, in some way, calls biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increased concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbio grows better with phosphorous, but the fact that it can live with arsenic in its place raises the possibility that there can naturally be a life form that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or in another planet or in the moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant microbiology professor at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that the arsenic can be replaced by the phosphorous is not new, but there has never been an example to show that it works.
The Arsenic was most common in the early days of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
"I know it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth earlier," Foster said, who was not part of Wolfe-Symon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Energy Department and the National Health Institutes.
The stolen dogs that were missing in Compton have been found
The two dogs that were missing from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel were found, according to the officers of the sheriff of the Los Angeles county on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Pembroke Gales Corgi, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, against Bellflower Motel 6, according to the authorities.
Two of the rabbits recovered the Wednesday morning, and the other two found the Wednesdays, late at night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the sheriff's department in Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that dogs will be well found," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They returned with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in any neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"It's carrying out an investigation."
"We don't mean anything," said Whitmore.
"We're following a track."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found, so they made some comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a shelter of wild animals in the county of Downey the Wednesdays in the morning.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek claimed to show in the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, were still missing until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Euknuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and were planning to show Trace.
The other dogs were to show them in other competitions scheduled for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba campaign, according to Peek a to The Times the Wednesdays.
South California is one of the stops in the practically two-month race that the couple engage in canine competitions.
The moon by night, Peek and Rickard made the check-in on the motel.
They usually stay in bikes and park the car just in front of the window of their room.
They took three other dogs (a boxer creature, a patriot Parson Russell and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Atakis and Corgis in the van because they had a very large bird and would be fresher.
They left the winds slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard filed the van's theft tomorrow morning at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
The Thursday wasn't clear whether it would be a reward or not.
The lion is ready to run again, when the MGM restructuring achieves the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal judge of New York’s banknotes officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to remove about $5,000 million from debt, making the way for the 86-year entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and external production of films and television programs.
The failure of the Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. banking code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM relaxes under the founders of Spyglas Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 integrated.
In fact, MGM will not deliver from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently signing the credit, which is contributing to $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the Investment Bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to manage its finances, while fighting to make payments of interest of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-President of Enron and an expert in the recovery of companies in Cheber, known for his work at Krispy Krme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy more than 140 students in the study took much more time than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company to the sale by the end of 2009.
However, I drew up a few posters and no one was willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disputes, was finally supported by creditors for October.
When MGM officially exits from the bank in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-billion bonus for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who have been earning $375.000 per month for their company's management services, will receive a "winner" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum planned to resume production in MGM, which spent only one film this year, and gathered an annual pizza of seven or eight films to be sold in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance the films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study requires a separate loan of between 265 and 275 million dollars to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investigator Carl Icahn, who has about 18% of MGM debt, has been trying to arrange a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of your budget for gifts
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful player this year, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant improvement in their budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bicycles of $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings decorated with accounts, or about 48 pages of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget in balance.
Recently visited three national game sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" You and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic games could buy at least $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Act had been working; the technology game of this year will probably have more power, with the same cost and even a little less compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new games with associated websites, two of the most known types, Webkins and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the players driven by button arrows are increasing, as well as the players with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" You, unless otherwise indicated).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are football players of the size of a cube that sing a note when their bars are opened.
A rapture is equivalent to a note, and a second rapture begins to shoot a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start shooting, you can't stop.
For the best time combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking advantage of Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-pound animated mussel plays tournament change games like Simóm Dice, and can take the moon step, thanks to its innovative feet decorated with wheels with locking device.
The children who tried to play the game used Mickey as a dance instructor, even though their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computered educational games.
He has returned (hasbro/Playscool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a full set of questions-cards designed to turn a car passage into a session with an ongoing self-correction exercise schedule.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smart phone, here will be three independent alternatives.
MobiGo de VTech ($60, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years), it is the first place on the Leapster line, with a new and brightest screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years old) uses a iTunes-type system to present electronic games and books, and has a range of SD cards that allows to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just larger than a box of mirrors, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to shoot words by placing the blocks in line before the time is over; it is formidable for an improvised weapon competition.
They're more and more players that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toys, the two biggest are Wekkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a online pet at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figurre Pack, ($5, from 6 to 12 years) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the code online, your child gets enough credit in the Club Penguin store for two articles.
These could include shoes on wheels or a puffle dog game.
slightly larger than the edge of its toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last in a microbots line driven by button arrows.
The false insect is moving rapidly over 12 silica pads that live in random directions.
It's fun to make a block lab to see if you can find the exit.
It's tough too.
Ours was able to leave the table of the kitchen and even pass a mouse into the mouth of our dog.
A more moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As a urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin made the move in a square of the city, severely inspecting the nervous people at his post, issuing low voice orders with military authority.
He wanted the women's members of Chengguan, the police officers of China's urban order, feared and despised by their powerful actions and their incitement to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a bunch of spectators.
"Frames!"
"Pay attention!"
Show them, he said, "How beautiful are the kids!"
Four girls who only passed adolescence with white gloves and green olives and adjustable pants to call attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant shades placed perfectly above the head struck with blue and white hair.
"I personally think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, unjustly.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree title.
The province of Guangdong changed the grey green color of the uniforms to a slightly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of the force by intimidation: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officials surrounded a dime truck of snacks, and observed it with the constant cold for half an hour until the ambulance salesman picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, a city district of 660,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has joined its urban police with 13 women, explicitly elected by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the cops a softer side, female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johannsson would have to fight to increase China's high-level respect for these city soldiers.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are allowed only to comply with city orders, imposing many and other administrative penalties.
But the media of Chinese news routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed a survivor after using his cell phone to film them while resolving a protest against a green waste.
Last year, a training manual for Pekin inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it was described as an effective attempt on innocent offenders.
This year, an ambulance salesman in Shanghai suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents Chinese inspectors trained to attack street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a cicator in the government," China Daily, a national publication, complained last year after another argument on tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really methic cleansing."
The sceptics say the current approach is very far from this.
After the district asked for eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real rights or were simply a sex entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both things.
The district's announcement requested female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial roots".
They should have a height above the average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
The withdrawal to the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too expensive for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," said an anonymous district official to Rednet.com, a very government website.
"First, the external quality of candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial roots, etc."
Then came the "and the inner qualities".
Women's Chengguns are like flowers, he said, and he added, "In addition to being flowers, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the city administration of the district, is not anxious to support this description.
But he observed that high requirements were standard in many Chinese labour notices for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement of harmonious facial roots.
If this means being careful, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, the minor or defibrillated must not be presented.
"We can't let a cook or a thief come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be okay."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colorful mejillas and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her face is sexy, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old working partner, Xu Yang, said, "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also do not oppose their work at a certain time, they say, because they offer higher career ambitions than simply accommodate salesmen in streets where they are supposed to surround their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces more or less than a dozen ambulance sellers running on foot or on bicycle, trying to sell as many pancakes or tofu bags as soon as possible before being excavated.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We've told her many times!" said Mrs. Xu while a salesman escaped to the foot, temporarily leaving his car driven by bicycle with reliable guarantees.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than abusers.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studied marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officials lack the power of their male homosexuals to confiscate the seller's market.
They can only threaten by accusing the offenders of their supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the repeated public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were attacked after spreading the false rumors that some Canadian officials had murdered a seller.
More than a dozen Canadian police officers and police officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were stolen or burned.
For the moment, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But peace is only guaranteed.
Only two streets of the Fascible Plaza Baoguang, where women's officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people met in a corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the air instead of in a trailer, as required by the regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle screamed awfully.
The situation was suspended for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened the doors to their vehicles and quickly went with the motorcycle and their owners.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator assigned to the male team, remained behind, with his white flag given back to hide his name.
Like female officials, coordinators, 40-year-old men or more, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbically."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total nature.
"Most of the time is the public which starts the war."
Taxes will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's attorneys announced the mercy that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice had denied Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges that had emerged from his business with an ex-commissioner and his efforts to secure work by lobbying for the husband of the woman.
The decision ends with the most legal threat faced by Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered possible presidential candidate in the Republic for 2012, until the scandal over his case had domestic titlers last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said that it felt "surely satisfied" by the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice had informed us "that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no intention of raising charges against him on this subject".
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have been confabulated to violate a federal crime ban on lobby.
Interviews, e-mails, and other documents first published in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative job through lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's business with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as the treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and appealed on behalf of them after they had hired Mr. Hampton to make a lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law to make lobby for his ex-employee or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, which were close friends before the case, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict the use of ex-State employees using their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a first case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the status of revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Department appeared cautious at the time of accepting political proceedings after several important reports for its public integrity section, including the decision of last year to abandon the proceedings against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly some cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that brings several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, the chief lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and another called more on the following day, saying that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with the prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement, "acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments given to the tax authorities.
"I don't feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which claimed that a payment of $96,000 of Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was no more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that has been supporting the senator for a long time, which has obtained work through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave him in Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, the chief of Ensign's office, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "maching" the Ministry of the Interior on a dispute issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to make a lobby.
When the news of the case first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position as a fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, Ensign told journalists that he planned to post a third mandate in the Senate two weeks ago.
When Ensign's voice, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would follow the example of the Department of Justice quickly and conclude its investigation.
"Senior Ensign wishes to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will focus on Twitter
There was half a dozen of them "chating" in the court room's rows.
In a minute, they sent reports of the amazing witness via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says, there were more than 120,000 Twitter messages on the process that addressed the rape and the children caught in their beds in a house that was burned.
The Thursday, the widely followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the death penalty imposed by the jury.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have submitted written statements in the court describing the arguments of the appeals that will probably deal with the courts for years.
One of the most propagandists claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by media journalists, created a "circuit atmosphere", and this generalized and immediate saturation with outstanding details made public passions exercise an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint may require the appellant judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the court room.
"As I have experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that inclusion of new technology in the court room is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief lawyer of Mr. Hayes' defence.
The first court judge, Jon C. Blue, of the State Supreme Court, rejected the claims in a case last week, saying that the media were "care-controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been brought by passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the subject.
Over the decades, appeals courts have recognized that the coverage of cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic case in 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for his wife's murder, saying in her decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
Crime is believed to have been inspired by the television program and the film "The Fleet".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that had examined Mr. Hayes' sentence a century later might feel concerned by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the Court's chambers, something inimimaginable in the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty of Connecticut and wrote a report in which it was said to be arbitraryly punished.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might feel concerned about the idea that limiting immediate communication from court rooms could make judges more fair.
Twitter's question is only one of many issues outlined by Hayes lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been injured when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the responses of potential jury jury, showing them spectacular photographs of the crime scene during the jury's selection.
Some swearers said they were terrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela of 11.
Defence lawyers also claim that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and insist that the judge wrongly removed a jury who had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had wrongly pressed for a verdict by his foreign decision to order the jury to discuss it for a week.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But its arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They noted in a rejection of the verdict recorded last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates for Governors and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media were constantly turning away from the fire of emotion on the case.
"The daily accumulation of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "was never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state."
His attention to the coverage of Tweeter is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports submitted earlier was a game vision that would make the court's policy on the control of coverage weak in future processes.
However, some lawyers said that the appeals courts were often drawn by the arguments for adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that complaint.
In his letter, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which repealed the sentence of Dr. Sheppard due to the cover of the trial, and clearly stated that it would require new rules to be applied for the new means.
"This case," they wrote, "is the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the twenty-first century."
Can civilization hold a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign by invety and negativeity, this week a few civilizations have emerged in Washington.
Is it a preoccupation of a genuine future bipartidist cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to the party fight in the capital?
The morning meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not lead to any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But what they all say, it was at least a short discussion on the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win party points.
The president's Committee on Debt's public meeting was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is just enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a test period, seeking mutual recognition of signs of co-operation and commitment, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
The reason why the meeting of the Tuesday and subsequent assessments by participants were made with a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is tax, costs, health assistance or social assistance, the two parties are in opposition.
In any case, November's election has slowed the mood in Washington, at least for a short time.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to how to say things," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center of Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections open party passions, which then disappear.
That's good."
In some cases, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush tax reductions are won at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, refusing unemployment subsidies for unemployed workers.
Following the morning meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these issues during the coming session, along with ratification of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institute, warns that successful cooperation on the issues of the upcoming session will not necessarily lead to a continuing bipartidism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, that a period of disagreement begins.
"After things have to be done, psychology will soon turn the situation into a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilization can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for the main event in 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the establishment of the new majority of Republican citizens in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who have made a decisive contribution to their creation.
More consciously, the leaders of the Republican countries are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they should try to fulfill their promises to cut back the costs of the state and repeal the new health law.
These partial lines are already clearly seen in the initial responses to the recommendations of the Committee on Debt, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in certain taxes and retirement age, and the cut in costs.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been charged with one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have introduced the issue of deficit in the order of the public day in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been fighting to reach close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the chosen staff in the panel, suggesting that there are at least a few grounds or wish for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the conflicts between the Republicans of the White House and those of the Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of party shocks, when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bipartary cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partnership of the recent election, most Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead spot, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and find a compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partnership and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and it seems that there is a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of the Congress than was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as the prelude to a more transparent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization that is shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points on the issues that still divide them.
A United States filter document depicts Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy" and leaves a part of the reserves and money of protection that comes directly to Kremlin, according to the United States Embassy in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service manage huge singing systems, which helped explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They earn money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal groups.
Each portrait of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority", takes its part as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website on Wednesdays.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and he blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev asked him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleansing since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied the allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several free claims on such charges.
In September, when in a Russian television channel they asked him about a document that would suggest it was corrupt, he said, "It's a joke, a pattern, a festival."
According to the polls, the Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is not unusual to find the details detailed, since they were in the package report, and it is unlikely that they were diplomatics in a foreign country who do so.
"The direct Slavonics of the government of the city of Moscow with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to state that the government works more than a cleptocracy than a government," the note states.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and of the mafia which literally means "the roof" or protection) that passes the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the tax office, as well as all sectors of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"SFS, MVD and the military are at the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that SFS earns the money of the largest companies, and that the police focuses on small businesses.
One source, said the report, "he explained that Moscow's commercial owners understood that it was best to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) because they had not only any weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal pandemics is no longer a priority."
The note notes that, while money laundering is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by one end or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The packager's note informs about men taking bags, probably full of money in effect, within the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," said Georgiy Satarov, director of the group of Indian experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"It does not belong to a political class, because there is no political class in Russia anymore."
Without politics, no opposition, no separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At national level, India estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified in item 154 (the countries are classified at least as the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the United States Ambassador's note, which did not occur until late at night in Moscow, will certainly cause disturbance within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue that the problem is being solved.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be false and reacted furiously by a revelation that claimed that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that this would have been done with such pride, with such pressure and, you know, it was done in such an immoral way."
The Veterans of the Red Jemeres forced to face the past
In a weakly lit hall, with broken and unscathed walls, the director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man that he had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemeres Ta Mok.
"Here's everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and was worried about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the government of the Red Jemeres, the commander continues to be popular in this remote former strength of the Red Jemeres in northern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers still live in the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres return to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation enabled him to face the victims publicly to those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a book of secondary school texts that first taught him the history of the Red Jemeres to the children of his former soldiers.
And in July, a UN-Camboya mixed court issued the first sentence of an ex-Jemera Rojos, condemning the former chief of the known torture center Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, 35 years of imprisonment.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Anlong Veterans of Anlong Veng, putting their efforts into reconciliation and their efforts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is sensitivity and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemeries was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within families."
During the Government of the Red Jemeries of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, hunger, disease, or overwork were executed or killed, about 1.7 million people.
When the Vietnamese invaded and disbanded the government led by Paul Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an surprise that lasted until the last movement that occurred in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of wars from their bases on the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Yemenese fighters began to desert the government, culminating in the performances of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their beneficiaries, the oldest combatants of the Red Jemeres fell into absolute misery common in the rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although few elite officials of the Red Jemeries maintained their local administrative positions instead of placing their weapons, the ethnic soldiers remained poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have received a few benefits after income," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the Utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept of business."
On Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before he dedicated his life as a farmer of poor rice in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeries was good," he said.
"Tak Mok gave him food to all."
"But now life is hard because we have to get rid of ourselves."
The current Jemeres Rojos court has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of the next year, it is expected that the court will begin to process Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemeres.
The court's mandate is to process the principal leaders and those with greater responsibility for crimes, but it has not said whether or not the four cases will continue.
This didn't serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Jemeres at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma arrest, a project in which thousands of forced workers were thought to have died.
During a recent bitter afternoon, Im Chaem returned to work in the fields at his home on wooden pilots on a land road in the suburbs of Anlong Veng.
When the sun set long shadows over the restful meal, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She said that if the court didn't give her a call, she wouldn't.
"Camboya is in peace and stability," he said.
"If there are more processes, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who destroyed the Red Jemeries in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Camboya must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to advance, said Chhang Youk, from the Documentation Center.
"Reciprocity, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first book of text approved by the government on the Jemeres Rojos, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the book of history of secondary school of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know a few details about the Red Jemeres, despite the city’s connection with the regime.
Toque Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng Secondary School, said that the new text book helped students understand an important part of their history.
But her parents reacted scepticically when she brought the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the text book and the court," he said.
"They have doubts because they're not sure about the number of people that the court will process."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the text book and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemeres keep a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many bad trees and covered plastic bags is driven by a red hole covered by an oxidated hojalat roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a number of nuances after her death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, a mobile salesman on the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people of the place go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Paul Pot's last rest, where he would leave a hand of mature platinum with the hope of having good luck.
Belarus accepts to give up its qualified arms-qualified uranium reserve
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced the miracles that would leave its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treaty was revealed in a joint statement published after the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Martynov, at the border of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. Government had been trying to convince Belarus that it had abandoned its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without returning the past spring.
But the U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for the weapons of a Belarusian research installation.
This prepared the ground for the mercury agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to a staff member, which has been speaking since the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the 47 nations chaired by Obama in April, excluding Belarus.
It was a good success to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place in the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. Government has helped six countries to break free from all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved the highly enriched uranium (cent of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for weapons) and the low-rich uranium," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our stuff first... we're not going to make sushi bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said that the first task of removing the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made on plane.
The U.S. Government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of research with low-rich uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bienjewski, a member of the Department of Energy working in the Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of Lukashenko of human rights.
But the Wednesday's declaration suggested a potential distance.
It was stated that "as long as progress is being made in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is still a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not repair the CIA's flights
The Spanish Government did not repair the flights from the CIA with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda headed to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
That is how Wikileak's (capable) documents are reflected in the newspaper El Country, where it adds that the first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández of Vega, then requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report from the Council of Europe on complexity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "has taken the Government of Zapatero out of play" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"From the Vega he stressed that Spain does not have any repairs to the flights of intelligence through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "prevented pills," Aguirre reports on a cable.
At the same time, Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would give this issue the lowest possible profile, although the Government had limited influence in the hands of the judges".
On its part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Ambassador that he would not try to block the court's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any criminal element or any sensitive information," explained the Ambassador after he spoke to the prosecutor.
However, the United States reflected its concern about the " apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than the disclassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will make our efforts to manage the case clearly between Governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007, in a lunch between the US Ambassador and the Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are extremely jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his colleagues "to avoid retroactive inflation comments, in an attempt to lower temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the action of the PP in this regard.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalise on any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government," he said.
The confession parity was resting on the "hobbio" network of being a mother.
The youth spoke of the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Drop in the galley"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this name, which has been used since childhood, it was communicated with a primal and, at least, a friend; the two natural people of Noah, the Korean people of what it is.
Messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, you need to know your emotional life, which ABC rebuilds through witnesses from their families.
The young Gallega, aged 30, started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Túñez, an industrial.
They've been for a year.
When they left him, soon it was assumed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was hiss, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
It wasn't late for another novelty to meet you.
The elected was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring town.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the boy went to the Balearic Islands to investigate the labour market, the young man stayed with his wife, who even came with her for a week in Palma.
But because of the content of the communications, it is seen that his novel was fragmented, which broke.
In March 2008, he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mossed, because I've come to work."
"When I told him he looked good, but of course, now he's aware of what's with the child all day and he's not free to do what he wants."
Then he's talking about a message to the mobile that just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me a direction to send it to the child."
She complains, "If you don't like me leaving the church with my mother, I'll pick it up when she comes back," she says.
In May, he spoke of the return to his people: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only gonna be up to 19, because I have to present myself to work so that I don't lose it."
It's clear that if everything's all right, she's taking her cousin.
"It's going to be with who should, or whether, with me, and never in life will it happen to me again to leave it with anyone who isn't my mother," suspicious intention given to his bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, is supposed to be killed on the 10th.
"Cessar is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"It's going there (the child) to some summer classes, and that's how I remember a bit of bread from the dog."
The 17th memories and complaints.
"A very great kiss of Caesar, which asks me when you come."
" Alberto says I didn't know what videos on the e-mail, see how when he wants to find me, he has to laugh."
The 30th, the other: "The child's fine, he's going to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's making me money."
There are online messages on blogs dedicated to the soul and manganese.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the excarculator."
"Drive in the galley (epigraph)."
The last man who lived with her, keeps his oath, declares his burden to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything's happened because he didn't tell him he was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial prison in Palma yesterday, from the centre of juvenile justice.
The attorney of the office, Carlos Maceda, explained that he did not remember how things happened, "he had no intention of causing any harm to the child."
Previously, he confessed that he had buried Caesar in the pool and deposited his corpse in a coffin.
The defence and the prosecutor asked for a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 seats at Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important increase in votes and MPs experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already had the view in general because, whether or not, the perspectives are more positive than the number of votes that this training takes on these committees often double what it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while in the 2006 autonomy, the figure rose to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
To maintain this trend, which has been fueled by a transmission of the PSC votes and the credibility of the PPP electorate, analysts of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 members of the Congress, while CIU would also win four (now having 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 members (have 25).
These calculations would determine that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the population, CRC would lose a Member - now he has three - while ICV would stay with one member or win one.
However, in order to maintain the electoral calendar, the most immediate target will be produced in May 2011 with municipal commissions, where the population can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in its relation to the Barcelona Diputation, one of the most budgeted administrations - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popularists agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose its associations in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not have the majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, CRC and ICV.
In view of the Republican debacle, it would be unlikely that this training would lose its representation in the Barcelonan Consistory - 5 per cent of the votes - should be obtained.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced of the ability to protagonize the return to the taraconese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PPP has been located only 500 votes in the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ross, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, were found on several occasions.
Populars have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalunia and aims to form lists in the largest number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven detentions in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detained officers of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a Yihadian cell that, led by Thailand, provided passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), authored this last of Bombay's attacks that resulted in 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the Kampai operation, Al Qaida's falsification device at international level and, therefore, its operational capacity.
Researchers estimate that in the two years that the cell has been active in Catalunia, the cell has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they have been faked and then distributed to groups that integrate criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that their "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The detached cell is not the only one that the Yihadist network had operating in Europe, so research has participated, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not clear that in the EU's territory it is taking place in the next few days similar to the one it developed on the night of the last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani joint Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Aguambide), another development took place in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistans Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikallaya Kijbumrung.
These were those that led from Bangkok to the cell in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - stole mainly from tourists who meet the requirements of the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents should have been in the number of varones between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without printed faces.
In the midst of the investigation, it is pointed out that no data has been found that the arrests in Catalunia have been linked to Bombay's attack, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before this attack was taken, from Catalunia, it was sent through a transfer agency about $1,000 that were "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the "command" team that ended with 106 people's lives.
The police have been involved in extensive documentation.
The PP requires More to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had an opportunity yesterday to expose him personally to Artur but his circumstances to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already planted during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the pursuit of philo-superistic adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to plant in his mandate.
The president of the Catalan populace attended the meeting of Artur More with the security that he had received 18 Members in the elections last Sunday, a figure that was more than enough to be done, since the candidate for CIU needed at least one of the training that would take the opposition out of the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but the discussions that these days hold More with the rest of the political leaders are held in Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, in order to support an investment "all sovereign and independent talks will have to be discussed", as well as the economic concert - similar to the Vasco country - that the convergent leader intends even to submit a referendum.
Both leaders shared their support for extending the political equipment of a very inflated self-government and eliminating taxes and grants.
Details of Mas investment negotiations will be taken up by PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citidans) and Joan Laporta (Solidariat Catalana).
The geriatric states that the deaths were not due to "a lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot don't lose that your cello will kill more than 11 elders
The hospital officials of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press room to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while employed there killed at least one hundred elders who were in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the letter from the center, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to prosecute the responsible person" of the dead but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civilian officials".
And it is that in addition to the social dissertation that the entity may suffer because of not having detected the criminal activities of the cell, the great threat to La Caritat now covers a form of substantial compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime is withdrawn in August 2009 and that it has not been allowed to kill since then.
The judge had already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients in the hierarchy - who suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the missing but that, in caring for the patient’s age and pathology, the transmission of the phone was canceled.
Caritat, through her director, denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no only indication that there has been an unwise action by any other person who is not the imputed person".
He was already baptized as the "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders and explained that the first crime committed him on August 29, 2009 for a month and a half later, to kill a second grandmother.
In this case, death caused by overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime committed by a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the centre staff have access to medicines.
Insulin pens and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her lungs to relieve the suffering of the insides, used to give them death.
But it will be the analysis that is being done in the lab that will clarify whether Vila was not lying and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she cut them off inside by taking them away as she has confessed to have done with the three women who died between 12 and 17 October.
In the Charter they do not credit the events of the celebratory, even the number of committed murders, which do not disappear to be superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the judge and in the little sense that he has to change his way after he has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that justice is made available to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is at risk
Investors reacted violently yesterday to Trichet's yesterday threat warning that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Peripheral differences have been strongly closed and European banks' actions have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has only represented what is a worrying signal.
What has been produced yesterday is itself from an illegal market which is as deploreable but motivated by the closure of short positions and very speculative.
The institutional investor will soon lose the fear.
A month ago, the ECB called us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to be withdrawn in the morning by the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan by ineffectiveness and the elimination of all outstanding liquidity measures over time and leaving only limited weekly access.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that they will extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly ceiling with limited access at the end of the quarter in order to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bonus purchase program and even in the sign of intensifying it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will return the excellent response of the yesterday markets and if they are caught in removing liquidity measures, which God is helping us!
As at their May meeting in which they said they had not even considered the purchase of bonus and the markets had collapsed, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced that he had bought a lot, causing a new market explosion.
Yesterday a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasure issued only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous ceiling.
In this way, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basic points throughout the curve, reflecting clearly a change of market feeling after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland strike have been published.
The estimated figures are approximately 10,000 million short-term and some 15,000 potential and have until February for private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on the next morning, the Government will have to gain parliamentary approval of its new budget and still have insufficient support, so Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech in order to ease the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all play the same game.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's pleasure charm.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivise employment are heard by investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Bols has increased by 4.5%, the second by the rest of European Bolsas.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and consistent and we are benefiting from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key substation of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we expect it to be resolved with a strong demand and help to resolve doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Assistance would be self-inclusion.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasure has more than 40,000 million liquids available on the triple than in March, to expensive types and closes access to the markets without day.
However, the strategy must continue to be the wife of Caesar, "in addition to being, like."
I'm sorry, we can.
Eulen's President will defend Vega Sicilia's meeting requested by his children
The period is not tomorrow in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will, when he considers it "the rule of law", the judicial meeting of El Enebro of the next 16th day requested by five of his seven children and which will try to evaluate his majority and deal with the bodies of management of the signatory of Bodegas Vega Sicily.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are finishing the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their struggle for control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem to be willing to settle in his dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
From its board of administration, five of its seven children were dismissed, who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year and whose prosecution is recorded in the Mercantil Register.
The trial meeting of El Enebro for the next 16 days, convened by Judge of the Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has opened again the trumpet box within the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Martha and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants for, through procedural argument, a clear violation of the Law and abuse of law, attempt to validate and heal the radically nullity of 18 January," according to his official spokesmans.
This argument will be the basis for it, once the meeting has been held, to be prosecuted by the view that it is "the rule of law".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully to bring the judge to a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, the parent and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100 per cent of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the benefit of 51 per cent of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This is the fundamental issue that the judge must decide once the view on the appeal is held, for which no date has yet been stated.
Red Bull Triunfa in F1 with Siemens' secret weapon
A software design improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull failed in the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his story in this universal selection of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a recent squadre and, despite the rising trajectory of recent times, last November, in the final right of the campaign, everyone was set up by the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without disregarding the ability as a pilot of the final campaign, German Sebastian Vettel, neither of the capacity of the Renault engine to propel his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany placed on the market in 2007 with very far away from the high automobile competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories worldwide, energy plants, high precision instruments.
The aim is to play, faithfully simulate the product or process before it is actually built, thus avoiding errors and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's photo cameras, Sukhoi's planes or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its formula 1 factor has enabled Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the careers and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 the escorts had an average of 10 technicians in their equipment that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each period.
In the Red Bull team, 180 high-quality professional young people work today that, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all the results of changes in the balls.
Siemens' director explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bull's balls with the exception of the engine, which is the entire responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can take place from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech auto-keys.
As the only limitation of this feature of technological perfection is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as much at each stage to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high technology factory to design and produce its bubbles in a location some 50 kilometers from London.
It is two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The template for this comet is up to 580 people, including its two pilots, Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 of Red Bull is certainly the latest Sebastian Vetell campaign.
Among the vast technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put on the service of their participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose competition is inexhaustible and their zero popularity are hidden.
The factory's technology chief, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be said that I+D's advances in car cars contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology has accounted for 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettels or Webber will never be replaced by the computer because "they're imprecise gladiators".
HP will install in two 20 years own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive company in collaboration is his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will co-operate with the 16 areas already present in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set an example of the remodeled store located in the Great Barcelonaian Via, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with him for 30 years.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to place 200 branding points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish institutions.
The first ones to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The head of HP personal systems also ensured that the philosophy to install shops will always be the same, supporting a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American advisory group is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be played interactively), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it would be a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive trading network aims to "improve customer service and pymes in the purchase, care, sponsorship and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that is responsible for solving possible problems of the computer equipment of HP in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that may sometimes last for two days."
"This system is specially designed for pymes and users, as large companies already have technical assistance services," Helena Herrero noted yesterday.
Sababell is offering a million customers to his rivals in three years.
More optimistic than other directives, the deputy adviser of Banko Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and reverses the end of the past war.
Nevertheless, it provides for a depletion of interest margins, which will try to compensate partly with commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell is waiting to catch in three years one million individual customers, its pending assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011.
The objective, in addition to surviving without need for public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share with the capture of a million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank - their large remaining assignment, as it has so far attracted more SMEs and businesses than the minority customer.
This year has taken 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in enterprises more than 10%.
Another of the foundations of the 2011-2013 plan is the promotion of productivity, or the same, of austerity, with a reduction of costs as a target, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when the performance of the exercise is presented.
Several banks are now attempting to set goals and make them public because the financial crisis has affected all plans of the world bank.
Sabadell will, in fact, close this year's master plan Optima, fixed four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation has made it more effective.
Customers who stop escapeing storage boxes will be their main target.
In a breakfast organised by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be a "hard and transient year".
The executive actually believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something essential for the survival of banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of passion - which penalizes margins - is reducing, the price of risk premiums that are being paid by banks and boxes for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already being transferred to the price of credit to compensate for the decline of margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the flu, but the differences are higher," said Guardian.
Banesto has already given Thursday orders to his network to limit credit for a long time and raise the price of the differentials - see Fridays of 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the bank's tendency now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
The Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporate operations.
In the bathroom, make sure that in Spain "you're going to need bigger sizes."
"The year is coming to move everything," he said.
He claims that capital needs are "very high" and does not eliminate any Spanish financial entity from red numbers.
It points out that the FROB can increase the market in the acquisition of funds before new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell could survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important to what some Vatican banks already have as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, funding can be obtained in a short period of time through rest, which inhibits the crisis.
The ECSC decommissions a second fusion oil in boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, withdrew yesterday to produce an oil of storage boxes and to insist again on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When it started the process of concentration of Spanish storage boxes, several entities were assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Cajas de Ahoros (ECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, announced yesterday that this new oil of operations will be produced.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Cívica Bank Group cannot be said to be a second round, which there are adjustments."
"The majority is completely done; perhaps instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, in which it has collaborated very much," the director pointed out.
In statements during a breakfast of the Aragón and Executives Association (ADEA), Olavavarietta stated that the concentration process is being agreed "as soon as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it will be done at the times when, not now, was marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
"To pass 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities in a 62% so that they are much larger to meet Basilea," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of very few successful opinions on the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remind us that we must be within the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system of all Europe and the "probably" of the world, and attributed it to those who put it in court to "a lack of knowledge".
The directive pointed out that within the current economic context, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial entities and storage boxes, a system that has undertaken a "most important" concentration process and that "go as fast as possible".
It also recalled that the Spanish bank had very well stopped the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has established conditions for the whole Union.
The market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to pymes, regulation of private agencies for placement or removal of EUR 426 to non-performance aid, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports in Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
In addition, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility to address the current crisis.
How should those movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which shocks it to maintain the old traditions of good part of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany begins to speculate about the three possible consequences of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro, integrated by it, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, is about 50% of the population.
Thirdly, the euro is redesigned, in line with the proposals made by the sister of greater macro-economic control, strict budgeting, many of the countries of the transition, possible suspension of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now no excuses are available.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission had stimulated the deficits, the German Government had made a constitutional reform to prevent them from leaving in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (Plans of fiscal burden and stability in public finances), and what their European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second in front gave it to the central European country when Merkel had recently extended the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of critical violence, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the publication were very opposed to Greece's rescue.
Finally, in the last days of October, the new Merkel emerges with a clear position requiring the reform of Union treaties to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run at the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European, as the Irish crisis and everything else has been precipitated.
But its proposal, though well-educated, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should be involved in the reform process of the Union which enables those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that doesn't want to cross.
And it is telling all of us that, although there is now a need to take measures with which it may not be very agreed, from that date the former operation of the euro will have been completed.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area in which criminal countries are severely penalized, they may be obliged to declare suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strong growth path with high rates of savings and investment, consumer moderation, productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another option based on debt and construction, with huge burdens in the balance of payments, such as the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, is simply not to tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong if we didn't understand it.
It is not just about reducing public deficit to 3 per cent in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that current turbulence will lead to greater peace.
And let's take advantage of the opportunity window they gave us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting last Saturday with the big companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggest that despite the criticisms of Merkel, the issue of order has been raised.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are to be met, it cannot be excluded from leaving a highly developed monetary area of very few countries.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that we have been warned.
Sports and fraud
Treats like those of Alonso and Ramos in front of the Ajax show engineering but they do not want to escape a penalty.
The alleged expulsion by two players from the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game discussed on 23 November against the Ajax in the Campeones League has led to written ink rivers about whether such behavior is or not anti-deportable and if, if possible, both players should be punished by UEFA.
As it is well known, in less than a few minutes to finish the game (which had already been clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time at the time to get missing messages to cause the tree to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since the Royal Madrid will now be the leader of its group, both players will carry out the regular penalty for the next part of the liguilla, against the Auxerre, and they will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplining Committee has sentenced two parties to the team trainer, José Mourinho, and various economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but more often in the football world.
It is so extensive that it forms part of the ethos, of the non-written rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate raised in the related case is that it has been protagonized by a team of the entity of the Real Madrid (which in its institution has assumed noble and honor, and has in the past been praised by its players by similar actions) and orchestrated dramatization, as if by Mourinho, which adds an episode more to its extensive history of historical and provocative techniques.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such behavior is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether such acts are a violation of the law; whereas, in fact, they appear to be actions in relation to the sport regulation, but they seem to escape its meaning.
The issue is to consider the type of damage that causes the sports spirit.
One of the things that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, as it does not endanger with these actions, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that are attached to the clean game is to avoid the use of the criminal player team in an unfair way from the opposite team, which has not happened.
Now, the paradox of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it is not based on what we normally characterize as a strike or a fraud of law, because its violation of the rules has not been hidden to try to avoid the punishment, but precisely its action has been the most evident to receive the sentence of the tree.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders receive in the cases under consideration.
Here it seems necessary to note that it does not take advantage of the rival situation or benefit from the same party, since the result of the action is obviously to leave the team with fewer players.
And it's also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club can't count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Campeones League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, since the team can be removed to the first exchange, and in addition with this act players perform a penalty party and pass the second card cycle, where the suspension by accumulation of cards is produced with less than in the first cycle.
So, going around, it's not so clear that it's a win.
In the end, these actions do not conflict with the sports spirit, which is a part of taking strategic decisions that will make it possible to achieve the maximum benefit of the rules.
In our case, players did not act to avoid the application of sanctions (that would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without ordering the penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of engineering.
I think it comes from two factors: because it was two self-exemptions and the way the transmission of the directive was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive offer to catch group navigable dinners in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship focuses this year on a reservation estimate for the 16th and 17th days.
They provide self-sustained celebrations for employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the tournament and lottery, with December's arrival, they also return the group dinners prior to Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloons for the restoration and oil of Barcelona, but because of the crisis they have committed themselves to an adjusted price offense to be able to capture the majority client: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the companies and associations of the interviewed sector.
In order to make this year's calendar (in the fall of Nochevieja in Friday) more complicated, the applications were concentrated on the week of 13 December, resulting in the date of a round-table dinner reservation (the 16th and 17th days) and only movement for the previous week.
As has already occurred since 2008, when the phase of flakes began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners by budgetary question.
To avoid being influenced by tradition, many workers keep it paying for their own pocket.
In any case, some and others require war prices, confirmed by the President of the Barcelona Restoration Grami, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the patronage, today, is not ashamed of vaccinating how this month's festivals will be.
"People think so much before they book."
"He wants to go out but he has the warnings set out in the price issue," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give good price and good service", he adds, and he recalls that customers tend to take a step down with the crisis, so that the gap around the 25 euros has become mostly in demand.
In a survey in several central institutions, there is the accumulation of requests for the night of 17th.
In the Suberas group, there is a genuine demand boom for that Friday, with a claim to spend less than EUR 30, which they have responded to by adapting their menus to the coalition, with full forms of EUR 25 to 35.
In addition to the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 buildings in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has made more early reservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they explain.
In AN Group, which leaves El Mussol, Attic, QuaQu, and up to a total of 23 locals, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group point out that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who prefer parties.
In its six group menus, one vessel, with EUR 30 or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a forecast to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, as is the case.
I have also seen green bridges in some companies that are again inviting their employees and feeling that the volume of groups is something bigger.
On the side of the Facasarm patrol (including entities such as the Bares, Restaurants and Ocio de Barcelona Association), its Vice-President, Enric Goma, is confident to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that the reservations are "animal", even though customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Yes, the illusion of the festivals has not come down, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at "a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks' filters confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Ambassador in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department of Filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that cause in Washington the Pakistann nuclear programme.
Apart from the clarifications and jurists that provide details on the content of the talks and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between both countries on nuclear safety, rather than on increasing "decree", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistann nuclear programme - which weapons are not collected but remain stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for development in Washington.
This is what the Ambassador of Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, has written in a previous report on the visit of then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities to the territory under the Taliban attack, the widespread dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is now being considered, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a meeting with their American counterparts.
The most recent documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapons production.
A break from the package in May, which defines communication with Pakistan as "frustant", supports: "Transparency is often absent; aid offers remain unresponsible or are dissible".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit to the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, who left the responsible "very clear" that "the Pakistani Army should end with the tactical support of terrorist groups".
At the castle of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to avoid new filters.
Interpol emits a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange where it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "wart red" to "localize and follow Assange's movements.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, it's not new, it's only dated November 20th.
And it does not have to look at the latest filtering of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but at the allegations of sexual abuse that Australia faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was the day 20 when the international police body with headquarters in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locate Assange "in view of their provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member States have explained, as the organization has explained, they consider the call network to be free to proceed to an arrest -- which must reach the national police body, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed to be Assange.
The movement has angered Assange lawyers, who yesterday published a letter declaring that Wikileaks' 39-year-old founder was willing to respond by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with mytic Lavlovich Beria, chief of Stalin's security.
"This seems to be a casserole, not a legal persecution," she complained.
While the world is looking for him -and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence--Assange remains in an unknown paradise, but not closed.
The moon gave an interview to the director of Time magazine from an uncertain location through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the U.S. State Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it could be shown that it was responsible for ordering American diplomats who fled to the United Nations in violation of international treaties signed by the United States, it should be dismissed," he said.
His opinion was dismissed yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "rical and absurd" the request for exemption.
"I'm not quite sure why we should be interested in the opinion of a guy with a website," said the CNN chain.
Obama himself has been charged with a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new fugitives of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama to remain important to Assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman from January to preside over the National Security Committee in the lower chamber, has asked the Department of State to study the possibility of include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue any contribution or assistance to them."
Later, Tom Flaangan, a Canadian president's adviser, Stephen Harper, had to be withdrawn after saying that Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
He who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a baptized minister, ex-prisoner of Arkansas and possibly a candidate to the presidency.
"Whoever in the Government who filtered the information is guilty of trafficking and anything that is not executed would be a very kind punishment," he stated in the Fox chain.
Poigcercós seeks peace in the ERA with guides to the provinces in Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more multilateral execution and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for the great internal revolution in the CRC, without the loss of 11 Members and half the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation is not sufficient for the victims of the exhilarating Joseph Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is as intense today as his own mentor and that he can in fact cause headaches that he had with other extreme currents.
As a result, the leader of the Left will try to win the new critics with guineaments that allow him to be blind to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of the ERC would be able to speak about their continuity in secret.
Through paper, and not by high hand.
If the Charoists want to take a certain vote of punishment to the President, they can do so without fear of repressives.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the image of division as well as submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered to be ratified by the majority of the votes, but he added, without the need for percentages, that it would not be a good result "to Bulgaria".
Close friends to Carod require the president something more than putting their burden on the military, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between conventions.
But if you don't have the majority to force disbandations, they're going to try to reach an end here by May.
To that end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic redirection document that the direction will submit to the vote of the national council on day 18.
Its intention is to evaluate Puigcercós rather than that this promise to slow down the convention in autumn 2011, something that the cabula has already done.
The CRC leader recognized that "polophony" was damaging stability and that its objective was to make the organization, once and for all, be able to wash the syllables of doors into the inside.
In this line, the article that the function adviser Joseph Huguet signed on his blog is a symmetrical result.
In view of Puigcercós' ideology, the title of Innovation has given the fact that the leader will be returned to "in exchange for various objectives".
And he numbered five of the two that stand out.
First, "recompile" the execution to represent at least 90% of the military, that is, including new faces coming from the sector near Carod.
The second can be the big news.
Huguet suggests that CRC once the assembly is liquid as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it proposes a reform of the Statutes that allow for the holding of conferences through elected delegates by sub-fraction.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception to the Spanish party system, has been an obsessive of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two conventions.
In fact, the 2008 Conciliation Conciliation left the task of reviewing the Assembly at a specific convention of reform of the Statutes.
This is still continuing, as the internal sea in recent years was not recommended to deal with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors on the roof, it can be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.
23 completed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the contents of MILENIO State of Mexico, a decrease in four cases was recorded compared to 2010.
In November 23 persons were executed in the state of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the contents of MILANIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the three women and the discovery of a couple of bodies located in the Gulf of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, 390 deaths are reportedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the one found in San Diego de los Fathers Cuexcontitlán, the municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of fire and the arrow of grace on his head in addition to his feet and hands tied with cable.
The following day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the horse of a abandoned vehicle on the Mixtecas street, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the city of Naucalpan.
On Thursday's Thursday, the erectors found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shootings in the tower, on the Tenango-Ixtapan County highway in the river crossing the village of Villa Guerrero.
On the side of the body, a message was heard that was signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman, was killed by eight bullets after leaving his house to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were finished with a ball impact on each of them in the San Pedro Xalochtoc colony, the town of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot in front, a man's corpse was found on a lonely way from the Colonia El Naranjo and under the body found a caliber-damaged shell.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the channel of black water from the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies conducted an extensive search of the other members of the body, although they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a cave that was found in the pale Peña Colorada, which was struck by the hands behind and with the sold head.
The man had a wound caused by the shooting of a gun in the neck.
In half a month, the execution of two men, who were thrown into chains and abandoned in the cage of a vehicle on the streets of the Hacienda fractionation Villas in the town of Atizapán de Zaragoza, was reported, along with the victims, two death warnings were also found.
One day later, a box of cardboard containing a human head was found in the Valley of the Kings colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th round of cobijas, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the village of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a golden yellow cobija, supposedly identified by the name of Mario Ríos according to a message his executioners left with him.
In Ixtapaluca, with firearms shots in the neck, a woman's lifeless body was found in the village of San Francisco Aquautla.
In the woman's skin there were tattoos of the Holy Death, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, a car was found on the side of a man's tomb in the town of Zinacantepec with at least three ball impact and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of a couple of men with the enchanted head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies, there was a message that was signed mainly by a criminal organization that said, "This is happening to those who don't join."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and beating of feet and hands were found two bodies in the inside of a taxi left behind the Center of Justice of the San Augustine colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one was decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, struck with a pen and accompanied by a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag on the streets of the Juárez Colonia.
Along with him, the agents found a cartel with a message.
Keep China’s targets for reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured her country that she had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon dioxide and explained that she supported her offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 between 40 and 45 percent.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), His Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon oil and convert it into its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, her country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it was clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that regard.
China's climate change strategy referred to four roles: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these works, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which sets out the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with the states and locals to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction objectives.
In addition, many of them are in progress or have already completed various multi-year plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
A provincial project of climate change is also under way, another for the exchange of indistinguishable focus by rescuers and one more mitigation and adaptation, detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the Government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than is generally expected.
For example, emissions from greenhouse gases in China are six tonnes per person, while in the United States is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
He has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent in the last five years, and plans to do so much more by 2020.
Equipped with the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NPA national leader explained that the former Panist leader was in his right to appeal to the National Order Commission to claim what his right was.
The PAN national leader, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was linked to legality and that the former leader is in his right to appeal to the National Order Commission to claim what his right is.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagodo protest, he said that the expulsion of Espino was a decision taken in the local area.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal, in his case, to the Commission of Orders of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think in 2012 and that there was never an alliance for the presidential candidate at the negotiating table.
Ship Vázquez was convinced that the National Action will be strengthened by the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, in which it will have to be elected by its successor.
"This (a 2012 alliance) is a theme that I have never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was a planting for the local election that was successful and achieved the goal," he said.
The Panist leader stated that the PAN support 71 years of dialogue, so "do not fear internal competition; we enjoy it and strengthen it," he said.
He said that the Council would no doubt be able to choose the best or best leader who will require National Action for the next three years, so that it would deliver the "to whom the Council decides."
"I have that absolute peace and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the president of the party to you."
He predicted that the response recorded by the party in the past elections on 4 July would be reflected in the next content, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"So now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments issued alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause of observation throughout the country, so that "many hopes, hopes are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabon will be at the time of expectations".
When questioned about the criticisms of the PRI to President Philip Calderón by his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called the priests to reflect on the sections of the former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortaris.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than Fox and Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that comes out of the closet," he said.
He felt that the title of the Federal Executive could make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no fraud or much less censorship in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act law is appropriate, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," the president of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama was present today at national mobilization in support of the Dream Act Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network.
"If you agree to approve the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
Its brief message keeps open a cyberlink with a wider document that requires the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote in the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," she said.
The message was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade under the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue had been resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects could be established.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to solve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the rest," he said.
The leader of the majority of the Senate's Democrats, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "closed vote" for the Dream Act law, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, although it is likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the U.S. Swedish law would legislate some 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the age of 16 years, have remained in the country for the last five years and have entered a higher education institution or the army.
However, the sponsors require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which requires the competition of a republican gang, while project partner organizations protagonize an intensive capacity to ensure the adoption of the law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 branches.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
The supporters of the Dream Act therefore require several republicans to take the initiative if other democracies decide to support the initiative.
Among the most cut-off republics are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but have declared that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position at this time.
Although the Chamber of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put the finger on the door
The second round of The pleasures of the language was a passage where participants made a gala of the narrative
"That of the Sex in the Language I understand it but... the finger in the tongue? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the title of his question (on another Friday the round table devoted to the Sex in the Language, he explained).
The finger on the tongue... "sets us on apriests," looked sweetly at the Argentine writer to the public, mostly of young people, who was quoted at the International Library of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she had dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would then define as a big account, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of the "laga", goes from a doctor to a doctor, who does not get answers even if they track in the same narrative.
The infectologist is convinced that "patience is not my strength, maybe my tears."
Finally, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who stole the alliance in the middle of the passage, but who makes it clear that the needle is not a scientific term; it's the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "The needle is the real open, the symbol is the scar."
The protagonist was relieved and concluded that "from the tears I only learned that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and trappings of the language should go very busy.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a delicate narrative that titled The Glory of the invention, where the finger in the ring is not named but at a moment it is discovered.
With paintings of magical realism, it is a famous Hechicher, who also played clouds, brought back to men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that had lost a doll, a statement that he had come to talk about then America, the great novel that had not been missed since his own chroniclers told him and quoted in Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excess of the account by the conquerors.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) made a noise of the imprisoned witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise never had come to tell the history of America with imagination what he had missed to the dust."
However, he highlighted "the locus and the embusters who best imagine" and is where it comes to reality and lies, where it is no longer known that the narrative belongs to a band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its support.
It's actually called the "cervantine tradition."
"For his inheritance we are the ones who are counted."
In his turn, author Mayra Montere took note and praised the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger on the ledge.
The Cuban-Portuguese directed its attention to the great scourge of social violence that swept through its country - and shared Latin America - a product of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs will end up a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment established between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of this last one.
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero stopped her, whose intervention also highlighted "from that finger in the reading of the writer's compromised writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in detention, also in intellectual customs and control of the consciences that are rooted in dogmasism, forgetting "that behind every statement there is a small one and behind every denial there is a small one."
"To be owners of our thinking and to be owners of the reality we have to beat: and mating means many times to put your finger on the bed and bother those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, white and black, in established and untidy ideas and also bothering the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting us to recover the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three final hits, he has got high on his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the pain of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, two different styles are also faced by their techniques, who meet each other with a contrast marked by results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three cuts in the end, he's had heights in his career, but he's been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although he's still gone white and that's why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentina has ended with the medal of the championship, has taken a step behind the winners, and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The silent strategy came to its end as a trainer at the Tourneo Opentura 2002, when he carried the Morelia rows with which he fell across a total of 4-2 before Toluca; later, in Clausura 2003 he also reached decisive pain and also lost it with a total of 3-1 and was exactly before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, Rubén once again suffered a relapse, as his team ended up empathizing 2-2 before the cockroaches after 210 minutes of the game, but in the gang of criminalists he was sold for 3-1 with two opportunities to watch the title for finally three players failed from 11 steps and suffered the turn of 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get away from trouble and can for the first time celebrate a title, although he claims that the institution is the most important for him.
"I want to get out of the camp, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an attachment to which I owe me, and therefore the title will come to me, but the former is most important," said the tyrant when he was asked about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very liver has the previous end of which, of which, sure, has learned a lot, "the only teaching that we can have is that until the tree is the end we can't celebrate, we're ready for the dance, the players too, because the previous time, with two punishments for shooting we were already ready to go out running and I think it's a teaching, until the party is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shootings, something that doesn't bother you, because it trusts its players: "One never tries to get to the crime scene, one tries to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no one else and there must be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made a bad game of fate, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but if it was us, it left us something for this end that we hope we don't reach that end."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a technical sub-commissioner and to prove for the first time the glory he gives the titles.
EU changes rules to get visas
Persons should contact the Visa Requesting Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
From 10 January 2011, the procedure for transmitting a visa to the United States Ambassador and Consultants will be changed.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants should refer to the Visa Requesting Service (ASC) centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff shall take the biometric information of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of transmissing visas will be lower, and no payment will be required for the appointment, other payment for processing visa applications and more for the delivery of the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visas will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only attend to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their eggs.
As biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain at this time less than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for visas to the Consultants in Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press to present a finding tomorrow that would have an impact on the search for living persons in the space.
The U.S. National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) will inform you tomorrow, Thursday, an astronomical discovery that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life exists.
The findings will be presented in a press round tomorrow at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by astronomers, science described as the task of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In citing the press, NASA assured that it would present "a finding that would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which led to speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at our side and in hostile environments that were thought to be inviolable, and would put in place the possibility of becoming intelligent as humans if they improved the conditions in which they lived.
It seems that it was a microbio found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too venous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, creation uses the arsenic as a way of survival and this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our favourable atmosphere.
According to astronomers, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will let you know the real extent of the findings at the morning press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of life in March; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest month of Saturn), under the view that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
PPD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Congress's Organic Law, instead of the arrival of 'bipartidism', they declare.
The 60 legislation was not installed when an opposition block was set up at Congress, headed by the MPs PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared independent, and the four asked one thing: the arrival of 'bipartidism' in Camara.
Before starting the 60th installment session, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynousos Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tronban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since they were excluded.
With this reform, they resumed, starting with 'bipartidism', because now there will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PPD coordinator, were the only votes against the Board of Directors, headed by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, explained that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the coming days they will speak with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they do not, then they will be reassessed by both parties and the opposition coalition will be terminated.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from any decision, even if they have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Philipe Manzanez Rodríguez, from Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore they are in conformity with a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, it continued, that after being monopolical, Congress would now be "double".
"It's not the spirit of reform in the law that has an eternal Bipathy in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are chatting with other partners and partners to be more, the convergent has grown.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress has now become a 'botin' between two, with an allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now if they're dividing it between two."
Mr. Montalvo, asked for respect for the representative's personality, was given his place at the negotiating table.
"That is not because of couples' agreements, it is left out of 5 that we are probably going to make 9 Members, and we assure the five who see us, separated from different factions, we have decided to unify ourselves to find a place in the negotiating table, that is the subject that in the reform they have agreed to, we are out and we are not in agreement with that reform."
Salen $200 thousand more for "the supplier"
Pay a further check on the related owner of an electrical material company.
More than 200 thousand weights in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Association.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical material company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand weights.
According to the municipal transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 weights, under the concept of "payment of accounts for payment".
Mr. Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced to pay more money from the Community in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State's Supreme Court for selling a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that still belongs to him and, therefore, how many more checks are missing due to being sent to Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, it's just paying for what it deserves, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reacted" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as stated in the Law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to avoid other Governments using its services, the Treasurer has ensured that they have not re-use their services.
The previous, after that on 25 July, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the Association of its suppliers, which revealed that from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, in the Trinity of Alcalde Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid him over 10 million pounds, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million weights.
Emergency to visit tourist sites
They complain that tourists are affected by the bad conditions of Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a flood of the Sánchez Taboada Gloriaita, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that were in bad condition and to design a bad picture of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Dorada Association of Traders, recalled that on different occasions they have complained that the image of the destination is being taken care of and that the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and bunkets has affected because tourists are going to travel and see the mess and bring it back to nearby businesses.
"Politics don't know what one day a company is closing and they don't have the idea of losing the general, or otherwise they won't do the work in this way in so long time and without proper planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the loss of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Association.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, as it is done by giving preventive maintenance and not only falling into correction," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of being a tourist area should be maintained, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the Association should change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also shine with care and incompetence, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, in order for the tourist to come not only depends on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that is clean on its beaches, on its advantage, permanent maintenance in what tourists are attractive," he said.
"No due attention has been given and this kind of fact shows something that is not noticeable for all, maintenance is missing."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary for Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, since they are not used properly and they design a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put on line with the municipality and be the priority of having the city on the day, clean, ordered and attractive because it is a tourist vocation.
"Mazatlán fortunately offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to order first, clean and make us online to make them attractive so that they can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the ECE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges they face.
A decent and free labour legislation between parties and the State Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convoluted Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, 60 legislation, integrated by seven political forces, 19 MPs from the PRI, 13 PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one from the PVEM, has been installed.
The list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they will come with clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partnership or parentalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Co-ordinating Council, proposed that 40 foreign members of the Congress of the State assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges they face.
"We hope that the MPs will actually exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties because it is a custom that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and turn into carnival comparisons between the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He then said that they would confirm the commitment to establish the necessary points that they would bring forward to the Governor in turn.
"We are concerned that they come to work decently and especially committed to society and the sectors because they were the signals that gave them confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and collect forces to seek the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very difficult.
"The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, which generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow promote the generation of employment."
With regard to tourism activity, he requested that the new legislators be in the weight you revised within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with a lower budget and is inconsistencies as an important economic activity and a generator of divides and investment, and that it directly competes with the industrial agriculture."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for detonating tourism projects and to assist in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcohols Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislation.
If you're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Muñaks, cars and bicycles, among other players, are the wish of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next Day of Reyes will be difficult to enjoy their illusions, as their home is consistent with nothing more than 12 people and a figure.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph John and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they want.
The family lives in a humble home of the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives in the day because the father has no fixed employment.
"Sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have a chamba, but we sell Mandarin and Papa... already in the afternoon I go out with 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Kayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a mummy or a bike, while her 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie mummy.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has been driving a 'monster' and for his brother Jesus, 8 months old, Kayeta suggests that she wears such clothes for a year.
"He told me (Joseph Alfredo), 'I wish this monster', but I told him 'we're going to see the child', because he was very facey,' said Kayeta.
For older children, those who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Michael, eight years old, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, misses you, so a couple of those five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family can participate in the campaign Search for a King Mago, giving a game or an effective reception in the Northeast.
Four suspect drug trafficking suspects arrested
A decade of persecution has been carried out in Estonia in the context of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sale network.
Forty persons who will face various charges have been arrested.
Persecution has occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where drug production was carried out.
"About 750 Cannabis plants, four kilos of sharks, money and equipment for production have been caught," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a representative of Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women, including the two network leaders, two men from Sherbrooke, have been arrested.
The detainees had to be compared to Sherbrooke's court of justice in the hours following his arrest.
Canada's production charges could be dealt with, inter alia, with the object of trafficking, recruitment and theft of services.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests," Mr. Ruel said.
In this police operation, about 70 officers participated in the research module of the Striege of the Security of Quebec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagg Police Department.
You can fight against clandestine migration without problems
The law of the conservators, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the patents loaded with clandestine migrants, will certainly face a great opposition, as the three parties of the opposition have announced the miracle that they could not support.
"I'm mainly based on the Charter."
"I'm here with a party that has created the granite that you're suffering," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow for a year to be held by any person passing from a ship identified as transporting clandestine migrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also pointed out that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong whiteness.
"We are against and, it seems, all the parties to the opposition are against the project, so we will now see what the Government does," Mr. Duceppe said.
The NPD’s immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that indicate that its party is not strong enough with clandestine immigrants.
"Neodemocrats agree that measures are being taken against the accused of clandestine patriots, and that is what we intend with another bill, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the law of the conservators because it attacks refugees and keeps children in custody for at least a year," said Mrs. Chow.
Minister for Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position to play politicians and make cases of disregarding the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a failure."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its refusal.
However, a conservator has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to ask for a vote to be taken so that every member to be opposed would be explained later to his electors.
The new unit does not achieve uniformity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit for combating corruption and corruption by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since January.
The Metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement of the March has been made by surprise to more than one.
It should be said that, during a permanent meeting of the Council on Quebec's police services held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough to make the criticism of the ruling party that dealt with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, qualified this announcement as a "cooked conjugation of the chistera" and as "a last-time cappuccino solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over possible future unity.
"You will see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public investigation.
"How much more does Mr Charrest forbid the creation of this research committee, more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to leave Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National Public Administration School.
To get out of this dead spot, he suggested that Quebec be given a special mandate to the general intervener in order to carry out an investigation on corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervener," he concluded.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same competencies as a Commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent table is not the only project in the Charrest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be made by the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the court is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed by his party that his Justice Homologist, Rob Nicholson, is currently urged to make certain amendments on this subject.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to motor groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons had been detained.
Later, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being monitored closely because of the strong precipitation that has been registered in several regions of the province since March.
On Wednesday morning a land raid occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, they have been evacuated from their homes.
During the night, another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road broke down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded strong precipitations, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
In addition, additional 20 to 40 millimetres are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located in the north of the river and in the valley of Otauais were the most affected.
They could get up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
As these precipitations are combined with the wish of the snow that has already been accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that a number of rivers will disappear.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts to the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The waters of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chenea, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitation has caused some lakes to collapse in Sainte-Juliane, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the mighty rivers have drawn a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Otaouais, the depletion of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the Mansfield-et-Pontefract municipality.
The civil security unit continues to be alert and monitors the situation of proximity, as stated by Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Growth Prevention Centre, by its part, has issued the Wednesday announcements by communicating the growing strengths of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Loup.
Culpan partially in Dupont
The representative of Quebec Stéphane Dupont's radio has suffered a certain revision to the Canadian Council of Radio Telecommunications Standards (CCNR) by controversial statements relating to social and Haitian assistance, as well as its major language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an unduly negative representation of the Haitians and the major languages that should not be used in the broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two persons who had been murdered, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints in relation to the comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the Common Front of persons receiving Quebec's social assistance.
The group claimed that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable and not lead to fraud.
In relation to the murder, the submitted Stéphane Dupont had shown that the murder was a cowardly act.
Most members of the Committee have come to the conclusion that the message transmitted was not to be considered suicide as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes under "Dubent le midi" have dealt with a delicate topic in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any guilt in this regard has been incurred.
The final dispute referred to the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had protagonised a medical confrontation that had caused many reactions.
The CHOI representative stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not be sure if the needers were really receiving the money.
The Committee believes that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an inappropriate negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My sender has been clean for a year and a half," said the representative.
In all decisions, the Committee condemns the issue of major languages.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "including more than what is required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce decisions once in the hours of greater hearing within a period of three days.
A kung-fu king in Montreal
The exhibition of Argelino origin Nacerddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The game, which highlights "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, goes up to the tattoos and rings of the world looking for new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who lives in the Metropolis since 2008 to progress at the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as a employee of the UPS company, has recently given news of his rivals, winning two gold medals in the World Championship of the World's Amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San Shou in China."
"They will invite sportsmen who have completed their first four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's interesting that I've made progress in each competition."
"At this stage, I will be the first one this time or the next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a Chinese original discipline in which it is allowed to strike with the fists and feet, as well as to launch enemies on the ground.
The confrontations are originally held on a platform and, at least frequently, on a row.
The most famous pugilist in this kind of fight is the American of Vietnamese Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only maintain a competition in his career, he will no doubt appeal to the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is China's most noble and prestigious," explains the pretty boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand) ".
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but he lost it at the end.
"What has won me is a real professional," I think.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals are faced at the end of their category."
"Then each category's champions are faced with a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without bids
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the centre of this assessment of more than a hundred contracts, there is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which has obtained without a bid before the most important contract, the project management, by a sum of 295 million.
The Consortium, called G energy, was created in 2004 on the basis of the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5,000 million.
In early 2005, the Energy Consortium managed to obtain the contract without prior public tenders.
For the Czech Republic, the use of corporate associations raises a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and generate a rise in prices.
"It's a new method of collusion and eliminating competition."
"I mean, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said the party's president, Mr Sylvain Simard, yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question at the National Assembly because, he said, he did not understand how to benefit from this kind of public interest.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalia Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that a breach of this contract had occurred.
"I'm beginning to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted "depressed" and "with a lack of strength."
He pointed out that "minimum" would be the PQ to apologize.
Consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Usually, it is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or several companies to group their knowledge into response to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the work.
The work has already begun and will continue until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been granted without the entry into force of the competition; it has been negotiated.
In addition, the consolidated formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As was published last week in Le Devere, the formula of the Consortiums in the Technical Advice Sector is being submitted to an investigation in the Government.
A quick view of Quebec's market register allows more than 200 consortiums to be identified, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one legal person, i.e. Dessau.
With regard to the Green Energy Consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that "the territory of Bahía James responds to a dynamic of particular work and Hydro-Québec has been particularly responsive to it since the 1970s."
The chief executive of Eastmain, Real Laporte, of the Bay James Energy Society (SEBJ), has explained that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact sector actors and tell them: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Czech Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devor identified 109 technical advice contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their branches, in particular geotechnic laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
Total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies forming the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "good-known members of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has fallen that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which are "financial", before it needs to be better treated by its leaders.
Liabilities of responsible consumption. Green label does not inspire confidence
More organic, but deeply sceptical.
The consumer is confident only of sustainable development actors, as well as of fair trade marks and environmental certificates to guide his elections.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, whose initial results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is being subjected to a media universe where they post messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even violates its commitment.
Even if the consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, Quebecese appear to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not rely on the environmental commitment of companies or on the eco-innovation of themselves, reveals the measuring tool developed by the Observatory for the responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another conclusion: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates bearing the products called fair, as well as the credibility of the products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "responsible", Barometer noted.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of Quebecese people take the political talks on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by about a third of the Czech consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the suspicious nature of the information make 46 per cent of consumers reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecese say that they also deny the alleged performance of the environmental products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
One 61 per cent has given priority to purchases in the shops of their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, notes Barometer.
More green and responsible (the indicator of responsible consumption has reached 64 points over a maximum of a hundred years this year), the Human Consumers of Quebec loves to occupy the king's place of recycling that seeks to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
According to Barometer, however, this social consciousness seems to be of doors (from your car) outside: in 2010, only 28 per cent of the Quebecese indicated that they had used public transport or shared a car to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1 per cent of the participants in this broad behavior survey, which just completed their first edition, supports the use of bicycles and foot-and-mouth movements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has requested financial commitment to the recovery of the film complex eXcentris post of the Angus and the Parallel Society, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallelle, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex in the Holy Laurent bulvar and return it to its true cinéphila, have not received what they requested.
The Government has agreed to involve itself in the matter, but under its own circumstances.
Instead of the expected grant, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would, in fact, be lower than initial expectations; this could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a 12.8 million request, but since then requests have been revised to the bottom.
The Chairman of the Development Society for Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who led the eXcentris expedition, presented a proposal and action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report a decade ago.
However, the SODC received a counter-proposal from the office on Tuesday.
Parallel and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State grant must be completely eliminated.
We recall that the Association of Film Rooms Owners and Chebec cinematographic complexs is opposed to a direct State investment to support eXcentris recovery, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various sector representatives claim considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same company, has been carrying the author's film for ten years in his premises of the complex, after financing his own building, which could justify a derogation from the Treasure Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is patented in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to trust her client.
The Angus and the Parallelle company, led by Christian Yaccarini, push for their part a private funding campaign, hoping to meet $700,000 to open the way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallelle, has been projecting films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th, projecting Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Men and Gods".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not returned to contact Le Debre and we do not know what he and his group of proposals to the bottom they have received.
Lifting up the view of completed Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with regard to the United States, but reflect once again the feeling of superiority of these latter towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think of Canadian-United States relations when they vote and believe President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the United States embassies of Ottawa and Washington, which have been made public yesterday, provide better details that really contain substantial.
A cable of 22 September 2008 means, during the full federal electoral campaign, to what extent the United States does not enter into the issues discussed by the political leaders.
This caused a great surprise to the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
"I wish the political leaders would be subject to a complex of virtually inherent inferiority to Canadians at the time of handling domestic issues daily, instead of leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign), " he writes.
Therefore, it concludes that the United States is "the provable elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador has even more problems understanding this "insolent silence" because both countries maintain strong political and economic relations.
"Logetically, opinion, the ability of a candidate, of a party and, more importantly, of the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think at the time of voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will contribute to ensuring the survival of the government during the February vote on the federal budget, through which Canada will first register deficits in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40,000,000," wrote Mr. Breese.
In no way was it mentioned that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent the coalition from being replaced and that opposition parties had to make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication signed in January 2008 by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image that transmits the dramatic series distributed in the United States CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where there are little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappers to enable the CIA to make inquiries.
Another clue is that, during his first bilateral encounter, Hillary Clinton asked his French homologous Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some of Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but he did depend on "every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote: "He has submitted a document to the State Secretariat regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian-born Muslim."
"The Secretariat agreed to review the sender."
Finally, we can mention that the animes have been heated over the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flaangan, a very close former adviser to Stephen Harper, declared in the CBC radio that the responsible man of this massive escape should be "dead".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee's echoes.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the United Nations has proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in hundreds of countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) in a amount that is practically equivalent to a third of the additional reduction that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is highlighted in the set of major projects that the United Nations expects to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if the inductive bombs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70 per cent of the market, were replaced by flue-competitive bombs or, even better, by electromagnetic diode bombs (DEL or "LED"), would avoid much of the 1,800 million tons (Gt) of GI emitted on the planet to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70 per cent of the emissions from the planetary automobile park.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce GNI's overall emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gts of that quantity should be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures at two centrifugal degrees to avoid decontrol.
In the incandescent bombs, 95 per cent of the energy splits in heat and the rest, i.e. a 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompetant pumps, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED pumps, energy consumption is still reduced twice more.
Fluocompetite bombs last a half of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bombs, such as those released by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes 80% less energy than an incandescent bomb, allowing us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in hundreds of countries.
These new bombs can also work with rest and emit very little heat.
Above, they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have demonstrated their reservations with regard to flu-competent bombs, since they contain mercury and should be removed as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is, not flu-competitive bombs, but carbon thermal centres, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that comes out of the indignant bombs.
Only in the United States, these centres emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report describes the advantages this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year in electricity and 8 million tons of CO2, i.e. equivalent to 3.5 heat stations whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Marfil Coast looks forward to the announcement of electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Costa de Marfil, given the deadlines set.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results immediately," a spokesman from the United Nations Chief Executive Officer said.
"Ask all parties to Costa de Marfil and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left the deadline for Wednesday to midnight without publishing the results, three days since Sunday's graduation.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the Chairman of the ICE had commented on the television that the committee "continued working" to announce the results.
The Wednesdays have multiplied worldwide the demands that CEI finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between Lieutenant Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo band has been dissolved by the Constitutional Council of the "floating" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the fall of the State in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Costa de Marfil president's campaign, has stated that UN electoral intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country have made it impossible for the president to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political alliance of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who disbands any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to win the victory.
His allies said that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that he had filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after he had prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second turn of the presidentials, on Sunday, should have led to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a divided country two years ago.
The United Nations has warned the poor of the political class in the Costa de Marfil, which could be considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bedié (25 per cent in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the corrected data with the provisional static variations (CVE) published on Thursdays by the Insee.
The number of stops is 2,631,000 in continental France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the population active in continental territory and 9.7% with DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they wanted to work, are or are not available in the two weeks to work and seek or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to increase, with a new increase in unemployment rate up to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), with 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were in prison in the sense of ILO.
On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in gender among older people, up to 6.4 per cent in continental France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, up to 6.6 per cent with DOMs.
Only a parity of 25-49-year-olds has been recorded, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all France.
Since 2006, the Insee has not published the monthly pay rate, following a polling poll on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the Statistical Agency of the European Union, continues to do so and has announced a 9.8 per cent rate for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of Lyons, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation of public contracts alleged to be fraudulent.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for the abuse of social goods, fund-raising and public goods, coverage, active corruption, traffic of influence and property of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions raised by the judge, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue you by a multitude of decent acts, something else is to prove them," said AFP's lawyer, Florence Raul, before the client's appearance.
Mr Guérini, a brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit a document to the judge through his lawyers, before his appearance.
The miracles at night also began to investigate and jailed one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to deal with the vegetables he has to manage.
As to the assignment of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their implementation, he does not know anything about it, as the letter Simon says.
In the context of this expedition, it is also being investigated from the mayor Daniel Pinna, former director-general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for the abuse of funds and complexity, but has left him in conditional freedom and has been banned from meeting with the protagonists in the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have condemned him."
"The instructor's lawyer has taken into account the explanations and has left him free," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night at Wednesday, four others were asked about their liberty, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "influenza traffic and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aglomeration of Aubaglomeration of Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier have been questioned by "sustainment and abuse of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and by "complicity in the abuse of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandra Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering the abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Korcega.
Investigators suspect that their societies have a service to blank the capital of the great banditism.
The investigation is being conducted within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course, in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that research focuses particularly on the conditions of the appointment and operation of a vertigo in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as other cities of the Marsella urban community (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exceeded Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has been in force to the public in France, has warned of diplomacy and has highlighted the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the attention of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to the United States to the point of giving them advice to manage their own crisis of "rehens" in Iran (a small group of senders).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French youth was not produced in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by US justice for material trafficking for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the serious reality of how the French Presidency attempted to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram edited on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of takeover".
Eliseo's counselor for strategic matters, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegorne.
They explain the French method.
They advise the United States to do so in order to repatriate its own citizens held in force in Iran.
"Let go," they say, "always" in the media the words "the fundamental human rights", "innocence", "the immediate release".
Everything to honor the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often still."
Because once the attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, "the silence will not solve anything," Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "an ordinary Iranian tactic: the take-up of rehearsals for political singing".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will be held on 16 August, on the day that he will flee from the French embassy) "will require the subscription to Iranians of a large amount of money" (EUR 230.000).
In addition, it notes that Elisha anticipates other crises of kingdoms, a phenomenon that "will increase".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition requests the United States for illicit trafficking in electronic material dedicated to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The United States embassies, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to the Iranian clandestine networks of material acquisition for the nuclear programme, the excavation of Majid Khaqavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free Iranians instead of French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegorne, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it was not.
Elisha, he says, "not only has he been deeply surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose himself.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government can't cancel the decision," he said.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand continues under the "close" surveillance of French information services.
The councillor of Eliseo marks a number of telephones, calls and then informs the U.S. diplomat that Iran "is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassies".
During Clotilde Reiss detention in Iran, Eliseo did not hesitate in his efforts, using communications and "fugas" organized in the media to make the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad play a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The United States observed this activity with some ironic and verified that manipulation brings its fruit, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to "the "mediatic blitz" of French officials."
Assad is asked by the embassies in Paris what is called "gratitude" to Mr. Assad.
"Despite their full statements of praise, French officials recognize in private that they only have a false idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led to the arrest of Elisha.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validation of Sarkozy's opening policy towards Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, has just been closed to premeditated and demeditated".
By "exacting the Syrian role", Paris tries to "show Syria the praises that can be collected if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "save the seed of the dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassies know it well.
On 11 August, François Richier trusted him: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done something or not."
"But anyway, if we thank you."
"At least this should cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received her at Elisha.
In a communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played a "active role in the release of our competitor".
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The Government of the South Korean Government will adopt a law called “Cenicenta” that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many kids play all night and then it's hard for them to study at school and take a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, Minister responsible for the draft law.
Online games will be again available at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, as required.
The Government is also planning to ask companies that limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of young people so request, the responsible added.
In addition, it will make it possible for you to ask for free software that allows you to limit Internet time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and journalists regularly report on various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the indisputable campaign of world online games competitions.
In November, South Korea received four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
Global 2018-2022: FIFA designation to host countries
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicion of corruption, the Executive Committee of the FIFA appoints Thursday to the countries organizing the World Cups 2018 and 2022, a clearly political election where influences and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear: the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional board of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Portugal and the Netherlands).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation expects to win new territories (Qatar, Australia), after an outbreak in the African continent in 2010, or with its implementation in the United States or in the Eastern League (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's emer, the heads of the Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests that are being played in a World.
The transactions between vessels, therefore, may last up to the last minute.
On the other hand, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the announcements that led to the suspension of two EC members (Reynold Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have destroyed the opportunities of his country, including football, which only accepted the World once in 1966.
The BBC added a line to the week when a document was circulated to three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disappoint FIFA and insult the English officials, who have launched an intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron in his head.
The Head of Government expects the successful reorganization of the JJ.OO. 2012 by its predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved the J.O. in 2005 for London.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to recover England's brightness to the EC?
It is not clear, since the two Spanish-Portuguals also have many strong points thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Europe's Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the economic and financial prospects of both countries could fall below their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English and the doubts about Spain and Portugal's solvency are the only points they can make in Russia, converted into a weight outsider in spite of the gaps in their application (estadium, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has declared an "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct appeal to the English press charges against EC members.
"They're getting out of solving their suctions, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has experience in 1994, seems to be the most logical favour.
The first global economic power and the headquarters of the main sponsors of the FIFA, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed by separately an excellent project.
However, these new candidates appear to be premeditated for two countries that have organized the campaign together in 2002.
Another risk: the World's 2026 concession to China, strongly desired by the FIFA, which would cause Asia to remain without possibilities for 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on future tourist stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries are more likely than you are.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of paid TV rights (as a result of the time difference) by European countries, the dormant sword of the war for FIFA.
Second assignment: the test
Of Gaulle, he really had doubts.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he was skeptical.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is still less.
A mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current Head of State will again be applied for in 2012.
However, evidence of this does not match well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that he is skeptical.
On the one hand and on the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not withdraw a third mandate.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would take his decision "at some point in October 2011".
Therefore, the fact that it deals with the MPs, the Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has led to some controversy.
Is this the official announcement of your application?
Not much less.
The President only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of mandates for five years.
He just transmitted the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time I'm talking about the presidentials, with a funny tone, when I find this kind of thing.
"In the worst, or best, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had left in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "You didn't think I'd plant what would happen later."
Your previous statements do not draw you closer to the candidate, nor do they go any further.
They repeat comments for two reasons.
Acceleration of the race by candidate in the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone down to the gym what's taking Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary, the fact that its candidate in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organized before the planned.
On the other hand, the bad probes.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's application to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the topic in the UMP," the Prime Minister's environment has responded immediately and carefully.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be invited," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll always think he can win," said Alain Juppé, quoted in front of the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow for determining the exit arrangements of the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
As a result of the European sovereign debt crisis, Frankfurt’s emission institution will no doubt not be allowed to be as perient if it does not want to be able to worsen a more complex situation in the European debt markets today.
The political cost would be the same.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis of European States.
It did not mean whether it considered that the central bank should do more, e.g. increasing its procurement programme for state obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
In Brussels, during its hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more excitement about his intentions, merely indicating that the State Letter purchase programme in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we have decided" during the youth meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will keep its main invariable type in 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury obligations by the ECB has doubled last week to around EUR 1,350 million.
In addition, according to the indirect market operators, yesterday it would have again purchased Irish and Portuguese titles.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired securities by a amount of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the purchases will continue (see page 29).
The economists also do not expect any significant change in course.
Although loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, it still carries out limited liquidity allocations under beneficial conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
The economists hope that this device will be extended today for a few months.
"I don't think you're going to significantly change your program."
"If not, I would risk causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011, will be made," said Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Openheim.
In relation to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations in order to keep the market stable," says Norbert Bräms.
In view of the importance of European banks’ exposures to the euro area debt markets, the issue institution has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must compensate any price for the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the performance of the most fragile States," he said yesterday.
Because, if the types of interest are placed on the clouds, States will have more problems to reduce or even to stabilize them.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi covers the period
After Italy started the week of alarmingly, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the return of the types of obligations at 10 years.
A recovery of peace would be imminent.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional presidents have stated that they had listened to Giulia Tremonti to qualify for the situation of "unencryptable" and that it was expected a week's end to "imprevisible", statements subsequently rejected by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the long-term Germans had reached the record number of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of head (CRQ) had fallen to 263 points, causing a certain revolution in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that in Spain the difference with German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "market turbulence" and possible contamination from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the slowdown of the income associated with it, causing the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The last estimates of Brussels have been submitted to the government by a cold water tank.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3 per cent of GDP in the coming year (in line with 3.9 per cent of the government's budget) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the provision of new budgetary provisions can be applied after the parties for a total of EUR 7 000 million.
"If necessary, new austerity measures should be adopted," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
Italy currently has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Argo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy's IMF.
"There is no immediate, short- and long-term problem, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the efforts requested to stabilize Italy are less than required to other countries," said Pier Carlo Paduan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Representatives, after which elections could be held at the end of March.
In such a case, a period of little propitiation would be opened to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already demonstrated Sunday, night and day that Europeans are clearly solid, decided, committed to the defence of their currency and the monetary area."
Although relatively relative, yesterday's relaxation of the types of obligations of European States has moved governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of standardisation.
The Standard Qualification Agency & Poor's announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most common white in the current speculations.
"As in May, there is really a lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas say.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than market rhythm".
Aware of this hit and the dangers that are hidden, European countries are intensifying the debate to strengthen the existing crisis exit mechanisms.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers that are more directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
This also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of the coming week.
The ECB is meeting today.
At the end of the day, the type of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries in the wholesaler (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EEF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has launched a journey by Asia to inform the investors of the East Lejano about the news of the crisis in Europe tomorrow.
Although the objective of these visits is not to collect funds, the land is certainly prepared.
It is expected that the first issue of EAFRD securities will be carried out next month.
Yesterday, an official representative of the United States has entrusted Reuters to the agency that the United States would support a potential increase in mobilized funds through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
With regard to countries in the first line, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are accompanied by Austrian measures with a closer impact.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid all costs of seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider necessary to increase confidence in a sustainable way.
The capitalist partners of the European funds are finally developing the options available to speed up the normalisation process of public debt markets.
In Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750,000 euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to withdraw the paper again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a first-line actor in the European public debt market, believe that an additional EUR 100 000 million would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is an instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, currently with EUR 60,000 million.
A advice that could, of course, examine European capital in detail.
In particular, market conditions are hampered.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments in orange alert
Nevadas continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
At present, twenty-four departments are in alerting naranja due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already on the alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon, two, Dordogne and Gironde joined the group at night.
According to Metéo France, the falling snowy forces affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although also slightly snow in the Isle of France.
A number of snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, instantly between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armore, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of the Netherlands, France and Lemosín.
The snows are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Metéo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited to vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Guangamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
According to gendarmes, the movement in the UK secondary network is complicated, so they recommend that it not be carried except where necessary and that the movement of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During the day, school transport in Picardia has been banned.
No specific measure had been provided for at night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
Prefecture "instructs all drivers to drive with greater caution on the roads and adapt their behaviour to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked air carriers to cancel their flights to the Parisi airport in Roissy and 10 per cent in Orly due to the planned snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers be contacted with their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: first financial wipers
Since the debate on modernization of transport on the French Isle of France has reached its peak, billions have been struck.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about 23,000 million for the Great Paris metro which must build the Great Paris Society.
To launch this GSP, the State has announced a allocation of EUR 4,000 million.
At the theoretical level, this amount will be the one that will allow the CAP to obtain loans on the markets to finance a part of its double bloc.
Today, in the end, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending Finance Act, examined by the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the devices to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in taxes on offices on the French Isle.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Societé du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set out in figures: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is an amendment to a tax on offices that already exist "to modernise it, increase its product and assign that increase to the Great Paris Society".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no numbers in the text.
But it's far from 4,000 million.
"It is necessary that fiscal resources be added to the EUR 4,000 million of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and be granted to the Great Paris Society as the project progresses," we can read in the statement of reasons.
The SGP does not surprise you with this system.
"From the time the income is created (the two taxes, etc.), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explain."
"It shall be registered in the budget and used in accordance with the requirements."
The GDP figure is that it will start to receive 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4,000 million promised are not in credit, can cause a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Dealer hackers and smart spy
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears to be scandalous to the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and foresees a future dominated by reparation.
But let's move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each expedition created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is made exclusively by print cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on the sexual customs of Berlusconi only reflect what has been written for months in any periodical (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's profile has taken a lot of time giving horses to artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret officers should only be trained by news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a book dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work repeats (on the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This should not be limited to the fact that the authors of the hideous texts do not want to do indirect research (or do not know where to look for news about the absentee), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only rely on what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to the secret officers.
The informer is perezious, as if he is perezious (or has little concern) the chief of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, the editor of the Liberation), who only considers what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the United States Embassy of Rome to the Department of State was the same that published Newsweek last week.
Why, then, have they caused such a revelation to be revealed by these expeditions?
On the one hand, they only say what every farmer already knows, namely, that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State may be called by telephone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research movies knows him perfectly, so we just pretend we don't know him for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact that it is publicly repeated violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad picture of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the secrets of the most powerful country in the world has a significant impact on the prestige of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "reduces".
But we come into the true nature of what's happened.
Previously, in Orwell’s time, he could have been conceived of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, having been able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction carried out, visited hotel, taken autopist, the citizen was thus converted into a complete victim of the power eye.
But when it is shown, as is now, that even the secrets of the power secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be undirectional and returns to circulation.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the seller of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be held that can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel has already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be discovered); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, because it comes from the public domain; but discovering, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton are empty secrets means to withdraw all power.
WikiLeaks has not hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this legacy caused by such powerful power?
It is evident that, in the future, States will no longer be able to place on the network any information reserved, as it would be like to publish it in a full street.
But it is also clear that, with the current technologies, it cannot be expected to keep confidential conversations on the phone.
Nothing makes it easier to find out if and when a Head of State has moved into a plane and contacted one of the homologists.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, at the moment, my prediction is science fiction and, therefore, new ones, but I imagine government agents who are discrepancies with uncontrollable passengers, taking messages that have been learned from memory or, as a matter of fact, hiding some data written in the pockets of their shoes.
This information is then stored, in a single copy, in locked cajones with key: at the end of the accounts, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I wrote that technology is now advancing as a cancer, i.e., back.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has again created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
Video tapes (analogues) had enabled movie investigators to study a film step-by-step, advance and retreating, discovering all the mount secrets, while now CDs (digitals) only allow you to move forward or backward from chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, with the moves it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing but normal that politics and communication techniques bring us back to horse cars.
A final comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was being done secretly in the embassies.
Currently, they are the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's chappies in their financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the financing promises have been rapidly broken (called fixed start or early) by developed countries.
And the French hats have been discovered.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30,000 million between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed to providing EUR 7,200 million in three years and France €1.260 million (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press round, a large supplementary event, the distribution of booklets...
Transparency operation was valuable and was appreciated for what it really was: developing countries and civil society wanted all developed countries to do the same and with the same precision level.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2,200 million in 2010, which is in the right way to meet its commitment of EUR 7,200 million in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort is made, without prejudice to official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposes harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one selects the reference most appropriate.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference to 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years for fixed start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with regard to the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the costs of previous years or the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the sharing of donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and each one who chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that each euro paid is equal to a given euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is appropriate to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro given... As a matter of fact, only the cost of loans to the country which grants loans (i.e. equivalent to a type of interest) should be taken into account for its commitments.
However, France does not find such a useful reason: "response" its commitment to EUR 420 million by making a 91.5% loan (389.8 million) and a 8.5% donation (EUR 36.1 million); consult the EU document to see it in its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with a 100% donation.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only contributes 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In summary, in its fast-start financing, France commits a double abuse: on the one hand, on the other, on the actions in time and on the other, on the real financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it is able to give the impression that it costs 420 million "new and additional" as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems to be Berty who has been engaged in arbitration) could have a double negative impact within the EU (Why would the other Member States continue to give when they can simply afford) and in negotiations, since the developing countries are not quite...
The early financing chapter is a short-term gap with regard to the whole of climate negotiations.
But it could be a grain of sand more in the vast machine that is the CMNUCC.
We hope it's not like that.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with a view to respecting its commitments and the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could make progress on the debate on the long-term financing of the puzzles (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not be exempt from the question of "additional character" or from the method of counting the loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We are therefore left with the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, that he will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprising announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to advance negotiations.
Warning about children infected with pesticides
A 10-year-old is pregnant in one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published by the Association Generations Futures (the former movement of rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analysed, but are examples of the problem being dealt with", acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the food that often consumes a child of about ten years in four meals and a time of day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as golosins, were examined in the laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or likely cancers and five substances classified as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances capable of acting as endocrine disrupters (PE), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in practically all cases, legal limits are not exceeded for each of the chemical substances individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially cancer and/or PE pollutants is worrying," the association noted.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a decade of possible cancers and three considered safe cancers, as well as about twenty residues that can damage the hormonal system.
The manzana, imported from Brazil, envisaged as a time for college, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to Kenya's green Jews, including in the food in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian filtration, the intestines, and even the bread bar or the chili were attached with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the flu, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
In the dinner, the salmon wheel was the most "nutritional" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these "consumer cocktails" for the consumer is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The European Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) Alliance has, on its part, proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to prevent "increasing the disease associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables in Europe, 76 in cereals.
