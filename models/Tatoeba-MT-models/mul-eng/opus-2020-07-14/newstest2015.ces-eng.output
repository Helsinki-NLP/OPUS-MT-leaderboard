Petr Čech: Step over for the last minute?
It's all possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big break.
The next chance comes in winter.
Petr Čech, currently the reward banker Chelsea, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco, and Paris.
He sits in the smile NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists, and talks with Czech representatives on a general's heritage with the US and then at a sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the brand of Chelsea, the Premier League takes the lead in Thibaut Courtois, Čech has been in the London club for the first ten years.
Some time ago, it was speculated that he might be interested in the Czechs.
He lost the Spanish Superpohar at the beginning of the season in war with Atletics and did not even have access to the Lilongwe season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It also reflected the interest of Paris SG.
This French league was held in two camps and two camps on Sunday at St. Etienne 5:0.
Relatively the most pressing button of the AS Monaco Club.
He's in bed with balance 1-1-2 and he broke up with Lille at 1:1 a.m. on the weekend.
At the Bulgarian English websites today, the news that Czechs might want to visit Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, the Czechs' departure from Chelsea is not likely at the last minute.
The skipper on him wrote the course 4:1.
Peter, is it possible that during the remaining hours, you'll change your dress?
I don't count on it, but it's never a percentage in the fotoball.
Maybe during the day, there's a offer that won't go away.
How should such a offer look?
(Laughter) "Well, I still don't know how a offer that doesn't seem to reject it actually looks.
It should be agreed by all parties. In particular, it would depend on the existence of Chelsea, whether or not the offer has been resolved by the club.
Is it technically realistic to make such a move when you're in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract in a new way?
So I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, everyone is somewhere on representative races, and certainly today there are still a lot of obstacles to stop.
So something realistic would certainly be.
How many clubs is on the planet that could allow you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not going to leave?
The situation when I didn't figure out in the first three stocks of the new season was new to me after fifteen years of career.
Still, there's no reason to panic, to fight, and to leave.
I want to continue to participate in this file on Chelsea's position, and it's on the trainer who chooses what decisions he will make during the following weeks.
What role does family play in your decision?
I'll take all the factors into account.
It's very important for me to look at sports, but I'm also looking at what the family needs, of course.
Is it possible you'd get another club in England?
That's the question I thought I would never be affected.
But it's possible in the fotoball.
I don't want to get anything out of here.
I don't know the answer.

A man will be brought before the court for charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was accused of hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgov.
He reportedly had to rape a woman on 7 June 2013 in Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire.
According to Webster’s claim, she was attacked while “she was not in knowledge, asleep and unable to give her consent.”
Next, Webster is directed to rape other women at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn at the Scottish Highway on 4 May 2014.
The Court of Justice of Lady Rae set the date of the appeal on 17 November in the Supreme Court of Edinburgh.
Renewing a very American idea that labour rights are at the same time human rights
The Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a law that organizations in the committees should protect as citizens' rights.
"In accordance with the functioning of the committees, jobs for the middle class are working," says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, who is co-chaired by the Congress Committee.
That is why I am so proud to be able, together with John Lewis, to present the law that strengthens the employment situation.
This draft legislation will give workers the same legal opportunity to avoid discrimination in the organisation of committees, as in other forms of discrimination, and will stop anti-competitive forces.
The provision of a labour law to enable all employees who face discrimination, if they wish to join the committees, to be tried in the civil court - and to condemn compensation or compensation for damage - is a legitimate and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other lawmakers predict is to put it back on the American ideal.
And over the collective wars that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other States - the Americans have sometimes promoted countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
It was a time, and millions of Americans still remember it when the country passed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the right of assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after the second world war, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the constitution designed to ensure that the Hideki Toya military autocrack will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their committees played a role in the formation of a new Japanese language, included them in their language and openly recognized that "the right of employees to gather together, to collect together and to share is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the second world war, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged Germany to create a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that the employees would need to organize and operate in the new nation and therefore include a clause that states openly: “The right to create a marriage that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to each individual and to each invitation or profession.
The arrangements which will restrict or enforce this right will be abolished, and the measures leading to this purpose are illegal.
When Eleanor Roosevelt's former lady president, the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, included the sponsors and Roosevelt's guarantee that "each has the right to create and enter into the Committees within the framework of the protection of their interests."
All the American generations have accepted the basic assumption that labour rights are human rights.
When the country worked in another country, such as the establishment of a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create a working group - and their participation in collective interaction with companies and government agencies in the position of a balanced partner - must be protected.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American idea that workers must have the right to organize and interact with free and open societies.
As reverdent Martin Luther King Jr. said ten years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the forces of the people have not diminished, but they have expanded it.
They have increased the standard of living for millions of people, have created a market for industry and have led to an unintended level of production.
Those who attack the councils forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we wouldn't have to.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the expansion of the protection of civil rights in order to protect discrimination in the organisation of committees is a great delay.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that attracted America and made it a real connection to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could close all the clinics in Louisiana
On Sunday, the Federal Court temporarily blocked the Law of Louisiana, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five clinics of state care.
The Regulation, adopted by Louisian Governor Bobby Jindala in June, which is to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital of up to 30 miles from the practice of their practice.
The hearing of the judge means that doctors may continue to carry out legal proceedings temporarily and must, inter alia, refrain from this authorisation.
"The proposed party will be able to carry out its work legally and, inter alia, to obtain permission," said Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be planned within one month so that the judge may issue a more lasting ruling concerning the law.
Right-of-occupancy activists, who are the last in the series of similar measures, welcomed and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision ensures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the cold law to prepare for health and their rights," declared Nancy Northup, President and Executive Director of the Centre for Reproductive Law, which, on behalf of three of the five clinics, has managed to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decisions concerned doctors from two clinics who were not among the complainants, and also called for the granting of this authorisation.
Louisiana is one of the eleven States that have adopted similar laws, while the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures against the provisions.
The key part of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, closed the federal court on Friday.
Women's rights defenders, together with the Association of American family members and gynecologists and the U.S. Medical Association, claim that the need to have this authorisation applies to doctors who do not require medical care.
The authors noted that measures aimed at protecting the health of women and some also highlighted the fact that the measures would have closed the clinics.
The Reproductive Law Centre indicated that in Louisiana only one doctor has permission to perform his deaths.
If all doctors in the state had been forced to stop carrying out the procedures, the doctor would have stopped taking action because of fear of his safety, the group said.
The Louisian authorities have indicated in response that doctors who have lost will not be questioned while waiting for a legal application to be made.
Due to background diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, the vaccines are more often killed on the external cancer of the vaccines
Angelina Jolie and her brother, James, published a video with their pregnant mother who died on the cancer of the ovaries in 2007.
In women outside Australia, there is a higher risk that they will die in cancer than in their suburbs in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with cancer vaccines and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Susan Jordan’s QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute indicated that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
MALÁ STUDIE: New medicines can reduce cancer of the lung and the kidneys
Researchers have been monitoring women for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chance of survival affected the age of women in the age of diagnosis, the type of carcinoma, other existing disability and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was achieved in elderly women who were diagnosed with cancer in a more advanced stage.
In women in foreign and remote areas, about 20 percent of the population were more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of cancer, Dr. Jordan says that factors can be a late diagnosis and a poor availability of treatment.
"It is impossible to treat gynecologists who usually sit in larger cities," she said.
In addition to improving medical services on a far-reaching basis, the doctor suggested that it help strengthen transport services that enable specialists to treat women close to their homes and support programs for people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said that the study suggested that long-term survival of women with cancer vaccines is lower than the country level, which highlights the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today is published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, in his 33th year, young mother, Elisha Neaveov, from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with aggressive form of vaccine cancer.
The garden centre is suffering from a decrease in the number of owners of the house
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary residence of owners of households under 35 years of age could lead to the arrival of a “main age group of farmers” by today’s generation of consumers to reach up to ten million pounds per year.
According to the report, the loss of the property of the people who receive housing is at an average of 55 % of the amount lost by the people who live in it.
As other threats to the sector, which generates up to five billion pounds a year, there is an increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the location of the preview site used as parking space and the size of the garden is reduced.
In the area of Great London, where the share of own-owned households fell from 61 % to 43 % over the six years, there are at least one household expenditure on British garden products.
HTA and the Royal Garden Company have indicated that living in a farm or lack of space does not mean that people cannot plant plants.
Guy Barter, the chief gardener for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very popular growing in flowers - when they move, plants can take them with them."
The HTA report stated that the "golden age" of the cereals sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of households and economic prosperity between 80 and 90 years.
This year, he also announced a higher return thanks to the better time that came after unsatisfied conditions in the winter and deep.
When the East dictator says about democracy.
After Putin, on the ground of his youth organization, who reminds me of Hitler most of all, congratulated the nuclear weapons and, above all, pointed out that their views have been stolen from him, he gave us today a presentation on democracy.
But I have such a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many roses of the Fascist state.
Great nations have one common and that is that they can control it both through nationalism and that the complex of minorities can be transformed into imperialistic shocks.
It's time to go east, it's obviously different from the west.
While the Western world thought that the war on sovereignty over Europe was already far away , on the other hand it thought that they had been seen for a long time and that they should get their international position back.
Such oppression and frustration led the government in Germany in three years, firmly before the capture of Nazi power, and then followed the explosions of nationalism in a similar situation today in Russia.
And then the whole common culture of a strong leader, the ridicule of journalists, the eradication of infamous political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is quite similar.
The Vladimiers of Putin and most of Russia are likely to rise after Russia’s rule of half the world and the other part has been shaken before them.
The western politicians may have charged themselves, maybe a little Vladimíra paid for it, maybe they didn't call him where he went, and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he was just acting like a typical Russian man.
He made a house order, pretends he didn't even want to go anywhere, and broke his knife home.
Now he's decided he'll be back in a lost position.
It's starting a little bit, it's got time.
The guide is probably alive, where he'd run.
He sent Kavkazani, now the Ukrainians, then they're on a series of torture stakes from Pobalt.
You've been running a Russian bear in your skin for a long time.
That's probably what China is looking forward to, and it's definitely going to take off on a further exit.
And these Germans of Vladimíra are also well aware of how well they do, and I gave them in 45 so on the back.
That's how to do one new Novosie in the Karlov Wares.
It would be a base, and ours are a lot there, and how they're stuck there, and yet they're trying to get rid of them.
However, our veterans remember what they had in Czechoslovakia.
Now vote on their prime minister, Mr Sobotka, he's so soft, he's gonna fight like a bike and I'll shoot this whole EU.
It'd be so fun to wait for the big Russians.
They need to remember where their place is.
And we use our own people who live on their land as explosives.
The Russians are enough everywhere, and if they say they're stuck there, they're just stuck there and we're not doing that, we're protecting them.
And the Russians will rule again , while he is born a different one .
In contrast, Europe is just as good as a proposal that the proud Ivan can dance a goat.
Turkey has been calling the American diplomat for a Spanish report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called on the highest established American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spy activity in Turkey.
The mayor of the Bulent government said that the American charge d'affaires and the Turkish state officials were speaking on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept indicated that according to documents provided by the former U.S. National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of US and British reporting services.
According to the Turkish media, the Turkish President Recep Taiyip Erdogan rejected the importance of the report and announced that all significant states are closely following each other.
The oldest report, according to which the German reporting service was intended for Ankara, gave the Turkish government a more explosive response.
The Game Series of the Towers has presented other tricks of the fourth series
The series of games on the tour currently captures the episodes of the fifth series of the cultural series.
At the same time, they were confused by the appearance of the third series of tricks.

Police commander in Magalupu accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence to the Office of the Mallor State Prosecutor on the expulsion of police and state officials from the Calvia Office in the area of self-government.
The leader of the police in Calvia on the island of Mallorca on vacation was arrested after the charges were made by the top businessmen and bar owners in the unhappily celebrated party quarter in Magaluf.
The District Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken to the investigation post after he was charged with the corruption of several companies from Punta Ballena, a street where most bars and night-stars are located in Magalupu.
According to Mallorca Diario’s online account, the prosecutors of the Mallorian Authority submitted on Friday evidence against corruption by police and state officials in the independent area of Calvia.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police for associating with the charges of corruption and, together with Navarre, was heard by the judge.
Spain's ABC-wide debt was quoted by the restorative owners of night-care companies, who have a significant impact on their businesses by the public factors.
"It's not about making money for a long time, but about surviving," said one of the entrepreneurs in court.
Don't play with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf arrived at the world’s top page of magazines after the eight-year-old British tourist video appeared on YouTube, which provided oral sex to 24 men during the tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to look at opiums and customers in a number of holiday parties in Magabu by reducing the number of poorly known alcoholic tournaments by bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where an oral sex event occurred, was forced to close and together with tour organizers after Carnage's bars to pay the rent of 55,000 euros ($73 000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular in Britain, was also a witness of many abuses under the influence of alcohol, including fashion waves known as “balconing” where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first summer day was marked by rain and storms that had an impact on Adelaide airport
JARO brought the south of South Australia a winter surprise, came with a strong rain and a cold wind that seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
The next 5 mm match has to fit in the city up to nine hours of evening and another 6.6 mm suitable during the night per week.
The last meal was presented together with a few short transfers associated with the storm and wind currents that began about eight hours ago, and during about ten minutes, they brought about 4 mm of fighting.
After a few hours of rain came after winter, the temperature in the city was only 15.8 °C in the afternoon.
It's because the storm time has contributed to the late case of Virginia Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft had to arrive a minute after 19:30, but in a short distance, it had to change speed or wind direction and it had to be stopped.
Air raids at Adelaide airport reached the country at about 50 km/h at the time.
The flight data indicated that the aircraft had to leave the second landing and finally reached about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently led to the delay of the following years, including the flight of Emmirates from Dubai and the flight of Kantas from Sydney.
According to the forecast they reach a maximum of 16 °C in the adrenal temperature and one or two overheatings may occur.
Children of Israel returning to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the area near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending years in anti-Bambobic shelters, while during the seventeenth war between Israel and Hamas at their homes, rockets and mines were attacked. However, the schools in Gaza remain closed while the land is remembered for fighting.
The beginning of school brought to the community the marked attacks of joy and excitement in southern Israel, but the signs of wars are still clear.
In Ashdod, a town in the south of the country, the school staff who took the rocket away from the wall after the explosions and are willing to wait for the children to return.
"We're a little afraid, but otherwise we're happy," said Ronit Bartová, a Cuban citizen of Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of children in this area really need to go back to everyday routine.
Her only daughter, Shani Bart, has made it "it's a little special" to go to school once again.
"We survived a few difficult moments, and we didn't even leave the house," she said.
Kibuc, who is near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuben Rivlin to offer his support to the citizens.
Until the end of the war last week, thousands of border residents like Saad stayed inside their homes or homes and left to safer areas away from Gaza to escape rockets and mines.
A lot of Nachal Oz, a village close to the border with Gaza, where she shot a four-year-old boy from the Palestinian monument.
The Minister of Education said that about twelve families were still unrecognizable.
Their children were temporarily placed in retirement schools.
The president of the government, Benjamin Netanyah, visited the school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was heavily occupied by the Palestinian palace.
He urged the children to study diligently and added: “We will take care of your education and safety.”
Israel and Hamas have agreed on a timeless peace in the past.
The halting of the network's bombing led to the immediate end of the wars, however, did not solve the key problems such as Hamas' requirement for the end of the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reopening of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the repatriation of Hamas and the return of the two armies to battle.
It is expected that a new round of unforeseeable meetings will begin later this month in Egypt.
According to the Palestinians and the UN in the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians died, of whom three quarters formed civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel suspects this number and suggests that at least half of the murdered were radical, although there is no clear evidence for this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired in wars on Israel's cities, mainly on the south of the country, 4,591 rockets and fired from the mines.
The Israeli army once again carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and eventually 250,000 people were hiding in the hundreds of UN schools that turned into temporary shelters.
Because of tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and because of the ongoing wars, school officials left school last week at the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that they will open the school quickly so that we can complete the education as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in the largest city of Gaza.
I'm standing behind you.
Laphatu treated the heat
The Czech football representative met in Prague today before noon in the middle of the United States and the next initial boosting of the qualifications of the European Mission against the Netherlands.
The three-year-old frame has problems with partner attacker David Lafata, who suffers from heat.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players, and David's probably still got some of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be all right first," said coach Paul Vrba to reporters.
"If it's two or three days, or it's gonna be late tomorrow, it'll be seen according to his health status, which our doctor will decide about," he added.
The other players are all right.
"Of course someone has some disease, but it's not like they can't train or take part in a race with the US," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night, the Vrba called as the last player of the Lukáše Vach.
He admitted that this was not an easy decision, given that there were also other mediators.
I decided on the basis of the fact that Luke is a prospective player, 25 years old.
The decision was very complicated, but I stand for it," the floor of the House.
What about Shural?
I'll see what's going on with Latatou.
It is not excluded that in the case of health problems, nominations could still be changed.
On the weekend with great performance, for example, liberal Josef Shural, who gave hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have shown the form in recent times.
We'll see how David Lafata's gonna be on it.
If it's not possible to be in the middle to be available, I'm not saying I can't name any of the players in the Czech league," the Vrba subpoena said.
Today the afternoon is waiting for a trainer on Strahov, in the afternoon a classic passerby trainer in front of the United States on the summer, which will be opened for fans and after which the autogram will be followed.
A run-up with America is played in the middle of 20:15 and a national team in it will attack the prime winner under the Wrbo.
In the previous three preparations, he played two remixes and once lost.
The qualification file with the Netherlands is then on programme 9 September from 20:45.
Birds go to Netherlands to Italy
The worm's glad he's got more time on the train than in the past.
It's a good thing if you have players eight days and you can add some things we didn't have much time to do before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing ourselves for the best in the Netherlands," said the Wrba.
The Dutch will be present in Prague on Thursday in Italy, and the Duel will personally follow the former temporary representative poet Josef Pešice.
Give us the information that's on the tape.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a party, and we're gonna get rid of him.
A new coach will come to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," the Wrba said to bronze medalists from a recent world champion.
According to very closely monitored housing prices in the winter period, they have grown in the last seven years.
According to the housing price index in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased by 1.1 % in August to the agency's sub-sector.
The increase led to a total increase in red, red and blue to 4.2%, the highest in winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices increased by 10.9 %, more than twice a year by August 2013, however the profit was not fairly distributed in the country.
The RP Data Tim Lawless research director indicated that Sydney and Melbourne are on the market.
RP Data shows that housing prices in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne by 11.7%.
Among the other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin with an increase in prices between five and six per cent.
On the other hand, Canberra was established, which damaged the State's cost reduction and where prices increased by only 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that when it began to rain now, it would increase the number of properties for sale in the following months, which would be a "real test" market.
"In view of the sustainable high rate of auctions, generally high sales speed and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of living will be even higher over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never beat me.
He never told me "I like you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of German immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
His father, who died when Henry 19, and who worked at the factory, had a colder relationship.
Henry is trying comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After the death of his mother, Henry went through a "valueful" therapy and now he thinks about his relationship with his father.
He knew little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have only heard his voice: “Stand still with that frame of mind.
Leave the sister alone.
Stop it!
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were already grown - they went to the bar and picked up things like a doll with a beer or the beauty of a cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life was a serious guy in the kitchen what you read in the newspaper.
Henry recently visited Dudley's locker, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he saw what life he had to live for.
Today, there's more light there, but it's still dark, frozen, cold labyrinth, where the flames explode and there's a lot of hot and dry.
Dad always walked out and just lay there, and then he heard how little he started singing for himself, because he smells like a viper.
As I walked along, I realized that he had been working this year to enjoy his family, and I began to respect him more.
And yet Henry lived as a child without parental love.
Dad didn't kill anyone, he didn't say, "I like you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, who's with Dawn Frank, made it possible for him to live up to the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop with that "I like you"?
Don't touch me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn Frank.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With Frank who was married for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of stress, and the symptoms of diabetes began to develop, the doctor said, “You have to make radical changes. ”
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I had to keep a drastic diet in order to get rid of the gloves.
It's very hard.
I'm sorry.
No one wants to eat the same shit.
Changes in the direction of Henry's career collection may be reflected in his elegant, sharp brat.
After he received recognition from his criticism of Othell, he went down to the castle.
She's been tracking Comedy's full of amnesty and Lotty Augusta Wilson.
It's a different experience than that of sitcoms and comedy who have fulfilled his hettic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
The DJ looked at him on the floor as someone looks like, and wrote about him in the talent competition New Faces.
His television career began in the mid - 70 ’ s: “I have long been the only black copyist/commist on television. ”
He learned to walk.
In addition to being aware of the public, I also had to learn how to imagine how to act, be a star and be on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Given his manager's right to the film production The Black and White Mintral Show, the fun program in which the priests took over the blacks, Henry finally released his comedy five years ago.
That's why my family's been pregnant.
I'm a little surprised that it never happened, but I don't hate it.
Even though it was a special and painful position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the tax.
What was "years and years assessed was the main product of British television", but also was also "Groesque black parody."
In the 1980 ’ s, Henry worked in alternative comedian circles, and he introduced the positions that at the same time ridiculed and praised British black culture.
The first series The Lenny Henry Show started sending in 1984 and in the 90s he was also known as chief of the Gareth Blacklock in Chef's comedian series!.
For the next decade, he was taken with advertising, documents, TV series, and films, but after sending his series of LennyHenry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said: “So much as you're going to do now, Lene, it seems a little bit like you've landed in one place or you're getting out of the road."
Next on the series was the documentary series on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great on...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't study him at school properly, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
All in the class, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dencho, said, "You should try it."
Don't worry about what you're talking about if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare.
Henry presented twelve lines of Othello's final word for the document and was already in it.
It made me feel I can do it.
It's like it's gonna give me a lift.
"That's it. It's important, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the test was tough, and before that, I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
Looks like they're waiting for the past, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in Comedy with a lot of mistakes.
I was at the National Festival once, and I couldn't believe it.
One moment I thought, "You've changed."
It came to a technical event and Henry felt instinctively that he had to take responsibility for the entertainment of the audience.
"The voice in my head said to me, 'Before the computer starts, you have to take them ten minutes now."'
Instead, the governor announced that the presentation would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went out of jail, and something said to me, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You play, so stay in role."
Henry in Plotech in Duchess Theatre
Learning the Pleto text was a challenge.
Panika's pretty good, giving up.
The game was also well accepted, so it is like God’s sign that says, “You should do this.”
Of course, that's what the Voice of the Voice says.
So I'm staying in it.
I really like it.
I like the taste.
Henry still remains the brain of a comedian - all the time our conversation stops with humorous exposure when it enters and emerges from the role of the imitator.
I decided not to stand up because having peace from a room full of foreigners is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into the dark street.
Sometimes I do live at the Apollo, but I don't like it as much as before.
I was wondering if he's ever even organizing some stand-up tournaments.
The joy of sitting in one room with the director, which helps to give pictures of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I would ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnations?
I think so.
I'm having a good time.
It's fun.
You're still telling stories that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to welcome non-existing employees
Kenya started with the biometric registration of all its state officials to try to remove from the government's pay list of non-residents.
According to a government declaration, employees who do not register within the next two weeks shall cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid after they leave the state service.
After the adoption of the Authority in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced that he would commit corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state is coming monthly at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) on payments to non-residents and in addition to the use of official power.
The government suspects that the payments are still posted on bank accounts and after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, the BBC reporter from the capital of Nairobi, Wanjam Chebusiri.
All state officials must be provided with the identification centres within the next two weeks where their data will be biometrically recorded, which shall be reported by the government.
It goes on to say that anyone who fails without sufficient apology will be excluded from the payroll.
"The creation of real public services will significantly contribute to its production and will also be used to clean up the payroll on both levels and solve the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Ten Turkish police officers arrested because of “screaming” against the government
The local media reports that in Turkey, 33 police officers were detained because of the suspicion of "screaming against the government".
The police office has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, there were 14 high-ranked officers among the prisoners.
Some of them were involved in a procuring investigation of corruption, which was aimed at government officials, including four ministers.
In June, several Turkish police officers were arrested for the alleged organisation of criminal gangs and telephone arrests.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time of the President of the Government) marked their meetings as part of the action of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and others in power.
Not all children returned to Ukraine to school
The majority of the schools in Ukraine opened again on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the president of the government of Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion he told the local journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that the country was determined to defend for the next generation:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony until September 1.
Not throughout Ukraine is peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastekhov, a teacher at the school in Slavian, who visits Jacenuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will benefit them in the future.
On the first day of school, children are traditionally praised as wearing raised shirts, bringing balloons, and teachers offering flowers.
In Rono Fairhead, maybe BBC found a head for hard times
This brings glory to the world of banking, media management and internal conservatory.
He's got his own experience on the front lines.
The career started in the consultancy company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
Seven years she was the executive director of the Financial Times. She refused to work when the highest role in the parent company of Pearson's younger colleague.
It's said that her departures were approaching a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also wide.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former director of the PP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a personal expertise: he became the government's advisory body.
Her husband is a former member of the City Council.
In May, I described the manager's work as a cake with food.
Not only is the BBC expanded and online entity in the center of public life but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is surrounded by two directions: inside the top type of hierarchy of its own leadership BBC, but also outside the public voice in times when things do not work.
It's about almost unsustainable monopol, which requires a thorough reform.
But the director would risk coming to a company composed of Chinese dynasty, disbanding it and preparing himself for work.
It's a difficult challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, many people would like to see how BBC is reducing - her power, her finances - and how she's reviewing her status.
With the widening of the scope of competition and the lack of old security, there is a direct link between the concessionary charges for BBC high-risk.
For a modest portion of 145.50 pounds per year, the British public buys part of something that is certainly the largest media business in the world.
The BBC reports a good history: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households and that there are only 40 pensions per day.
In addition, the presence of BBC is obvious: 53% of the respondents were sold 31% 10 years ago.
The use of BBC services has changed: Today, new titles are displayed on my mobile phone and on the order I've gone through, I can look at iPlayer.
But BBC remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
He needs a great director - I hope she found one.
The Texas Governor Perry claims that an offensive tweet has not been accepted
Twitter from the official Twitter account of the Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an impressive picture of a democratic state attitude that initiated Perry's criminal charge of abuse of power.
The Twitter was later destroyed and the Perry account was signed another one that has been distanced from the previous one.
He left my account with a tweet that was not authorized.
"I don't agree with this tweet and stop it," he put it in another position.
Perry's assistant didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his management.
Previous tweet published an unliquidious, humorous picture of the national representative Travis County Rosemary Lehmbergo, who was judged in April 2013.
When she refused to refuse, Perry refused to grant funds to her office, which Perry, a potential candidate for the president in the 2016 elections, brought this month before a large jury in Austin.
“ I don’t always carry more than three times the amount of alcohol in the blood than the limit is allowed... but when it is done, I beg the governor of Perry to take responsibility for it. ”
I'm the most popular democracy in Texas.
The investigation against Perry didn't run Lehberg's office.
In his old age, Michael McCrum had him, a special prosecutor from San Antonia, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was followed by an innocent and accused of being a tactical, political manoeuvre.
His qualified legal team asked a judge who was considering the case to prevent the prosecution because the application of the laws to the court of the service governor in the history of Texas is counterproductive.
Perry has stopped paying $7.5 million from the state fund for the division of public interest, which has a seat in Travis County and commits corruption in Texas after Lehberg refused to refuse.
The suspension resulted in formal difficulty to the left-oriented group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes he even celebrates.
After he finished his presidential campaign in Iowj in 2012 at the fifth place in his committee, Perry responded to the speculation that he could finish the tweet with his own photo as he runs near the lake, saying: “Here I am, South Carolina!
According to Berkeley, the market with housing returns "to normal"
One of the most prominent London-Developing companies guaranteed that the housing market in South-East England "returns" to normal level of activity.
The residence in the main city was subject to high demand and rising prices and increased concerns from the credit bubbles were accepted by the Bank of England in June to set the limits on mortgages.
Tony Pidgley, co-founder and president of the development company for the Berlin loan client, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market from the top point in 2013 has returned to normal transaction level." It adds that it provides "a stable environment for functioning."
The London housing market was successful during the decline because the buyers from abroad were swimming in the main city.
According to the Catastral Authority, in the last year, prices in the city rose by 18.5 %, with an average of 6.7 % in England and throughout Wales.
The average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about five and finally dropped to 423,000 pounds.
However, in recent months for the foreign purchase of London property, some of them have also been afraid of introducing new property taxes and of the possible "substantial tax" with which politicians came before the parliamentary elections of the next quarter.
Last week, the London real office of Foxtons warned that a deeper market review with mortgages, which represented more precise rules for loans, also reduced market growth during the second half of the year in the sale of property and prices.
The new Bank of England data showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages in the month of June, which indicates that the housing market is slowing down.
Hamptons International, another real office, reduced its forecast of rising prices of London properties by 3% in 2015 based on the fact that domestic prices have already begun to decline.
The volume of transactions, according to the real office of WA Ellis, in London's most expensive quarters such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, was reduced by quarter each year.
However, the request for residence in the main city for Berkeley was granted because it increased the willingness to sell goods for more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-like accommodation in the good place remained the same, and because of this, the property sales continued."
In June, the company reported that from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, 3,742 properties were sold, about a third more than before the high crisis in 2007.
The annual profit before the award increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before the annual meeting of the Pidgley company, he said that the annual results of Berkeley would be in line with the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be 450 million pounds.
The Berkeley shares ended on Sunday at the London Bridge on 23.96 February.
Hacker posted photos of Jennifer Lawrenco's on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrenc comes to the 85th anniversary of Cen Academy.
Photos of Oscar Jennifer Lawrenc's supporters were on the Internet because of hacker who claimed to have a "list" photo of other hundreds of beginners.
Hunger Games, a spokesman for the film stars, confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were true and hacker criticised for "public private corruption."
The offices have already been contacted and they'll get everyone who stole the photos of Jennifer Lawrenc's public.
Hacker photos that were originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing server were publicly obtained thanks to the interfaces in the applu iCloud web site system. A list of photos of victims captured by BuzzFeed includes the names of ten stars including Rihanny, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, yet the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winsted on Twitter also criticized.
"I hope that those of you who look at the photos we had with your husband years ago in private homes are at peace with themselves," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the series of cable televisions Nikolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious" claimed that the photos would be true. On Twitter she said: "This is my personal photos are PODVRH, people."
It's better to put it in the dictionary. *A meaningful vocabulary*.
Bizzfeed announced on Sunday night that talking people's stars, Ariany Grande, warned that certain photographs would be true.
An outstanding example of the respected new novel Howard Jacobson on love and letter "J"
They were released, that's the best way to describe it, they were gradually distributed as a cardboard box that someone left on the floor.
Only a while ago did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complex, stupid, isolated, and possibly a little broken.
And then she put her hand on him.
I'm afraid you've let it happen.
He was able to pee like a dog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was the so - called mercy pill that more than usual promised to remove him from his unique life - giving and possibly to provide him with some comfort.
Ailinn Solomons was a Greek beauty with a wildly sinful hair and a heart of flight from the village on the northern island, which was even more quiet and hospitable than Port Reuben.
The older company that Kevern thought was her aunt who built the property in the wind, but a beautiful one called, probably the Rajsk Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The drums prowled, there were dead ducks out there, the smiles signed on the window, as if they thought it belonged to them, the garden was grown, and the flood reminded the huge heads of the wild.
The house seemed like a chaloop of children's stories, scary and, at the same time, fascinating, full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shorter selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on a long-distance crosswalk and holding their hands, enjoying an unexpected warm summer afternoon, suddenly finding a public station that the country was pleased to hear about the loud music and soothing reports, when he remembered the old song of a long forgotten black comedy that his father liked to listen to.
You've got too much legs.
Because of their natural aggression, such songs are no longer played in radios.
They were not banned - they were actually banned - they just didn't play.
They were helped to get to the bottom, just like the word of the bottom right.
Human experience has demonstrated what would never have been possible without the rules and regulations of the law, and just like people of books, they choose the memory that comes from the poor to be rich, cooks and merciful Romans, so they choose ballasts in music.
Kavern stopped playing on the day and started playing on the imaginary piano and the rough, comical voice singing the series of Alyini's great walkers.
- No, no, no, no.
"It was a favorite song from the daisy pianist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
He always did that to his father when he wanted to write it before he left his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
My father told him that the game was playing with his father.
If you're in the word that started on it, two fingers a week before the break, you've got a pen.
It wasn't very funny lately, and it wasn't even now.
He just knew it was expected from him, it was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard of anyone.
Even Jazz, even though he wasn't directly established outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvisation came out of fashion.
There was only one "if" place in life.
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where it's going to end.
It's the same in humor.
His unpredictability was on people's nerves.
And jazz was a humorous song.
Although he didn't hear about Sammy Davis Junior until ten years ago, Kevern knew jazz from his father's flying collection of old CDs.
At least Alilin didn't say Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, she could not remember the time when the favorite songs were not black.
No laws or pressure.
A voluntary society is the one in which each part of it is grateful - thanks to those who were happy to be healed - agrees with the principle of collective gratitude.
The people of the African-Carab origin lived in warmth and constitutions for the drums and athletics, and so sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, such as natural electronics, have taken responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a functional phone.
The remains were the installers, the Greeks, the rest, the futures.
Those from the Persian Gulf and Levanta, whose relatives had quickly left the country, while doing it, CO SE STALO, KDYBYS IT STALO - feared that they would accuse it of putting it into the fire, actually feared that the fire would be next time - they opened a restaurant where they were selling labbons and burned water drums, not paying attention to themselves and little attention to it.
Everyone according to his talent.
Because she was listening only to the ballads, Ailinn was hard to understand, how from the simple words that Kavern had just sung, she could make music.
Music was an expression of love.
"In fact, they're not free," said Kevern.
Maybe it's just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he liked this song.
He was talking too much, but the missing garden provided an illusion of security.
No words could be avoided after the lyrics of the audiocassettes.
Ailinn still didn't get it.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he tried to give himself two more fingers to his mouth in her presence.
You already thought it was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said at last.
Unbelievably, she raised her head and left Kever's sight.
Around the world, nothing else was seen than a change in her hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she mistakenly said.
But it still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He's been seeing you again.
She did not walk that way.
Maybe a little cocaine...
You're saying you hate me because I have a lot of fat cookies?
Do I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too fast.
"Your fat kitchens are touching me," he tried.
I'm so excited.
That didn't happen.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble, because, like his father, he was looking for a knife needed to make it clear that he could cut the weight she had in the tips.
Maybe his father was cruel deliberately.
Maybe he was mentally cruel Kavern.
Even with a nice eye.
Ailinn Solomon's red and he got out of bed, made a radio and broke down unheeded wine.
No wine, so he can't drink it.
It looked like in her divorce, it was like the palm leaves in the storm.
"It seems to me that you're a fool," she said...
Until it doesn't bother me.
He was sorry for the words he didn't utter, and for the fear that he had in his eyes when he stood up against him.
Did you think she'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold North Pole, where she grew up, but she didn't think it was the same as here.
The same broad and ice-creaming ocean was concerned about them.
The same men, then, CO SE STALO, even more vicious and hater than their predecessors, pastors and casinos, were furiously bloated from their homes to their homes, ready to raise their hand to any woman who would consider rejecting or ridicule them.
Blbec?
If she doesn't pay attention, they'll give her their pets!
First of all, it was the most common expression for the erotic relationship between a man and a woman: an enemy of the early ballads of love that the radio protected - first of all, then one murder.
According to Keverno's view, there is a lot of cultivation because it was only about violence.
Ailinn, Solomon's unverbalally meant him to leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt confused herself, but the silence of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world, though.
They almost didn't know each other.
She looked like she was leaving, like she was watching him out of the window in the back, the man who got what he was doing.
Adam, leaving the garden, thinking.
She loved her heart because of him and for all men, regardless of how many of them killed her.
The man turned his back on her, the shoulder of a clean, tired, broken, all the battle left him - why did she seem to know this view well, even though she couldn't afford the only moment until today that she would ever see it?
Ailein Solomon's, again, looked at his feet.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and advanced two-year research in Offnow, the non-governmental monitoring system of the Public Administration, prepared a short article on the continuation of easy and medium-term violent acts in the areas where its balance or direct suspension was expected, most expected if there was a provision of money and energy for its removal.
"It has done a lot and has to do it a lot more," she wrote, "to calm down the angered aggressive people who fought in many wars and most of them won, especially in busy, hard-of-the-counted places in the countries where even over the shells of the church that emerged over the living realms of human kindness, it has been historically revealed only recently."
Some things, however, are harmless.
It might seem that the higher the church is, the lower the dust.
The citizens are excited about the emotional balades, lamenting sad stories and declaring that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas old brutality is as strong as in urban agglomerations, but also evidence shows that home, work, violence and even sports crimes are emerging new and violent intolerance.
"Please, you have a tendency to be too flowery," said her superior.
I'd suggest you read less Romans.
We're Nussbaum's head down.
I also have to ask myself: Are you an atheist?
"I think I don't have to answer," declared Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
We have renewed our rights to privacy and torture.
A feminist?
More silence.
"I don't wonder why," Rabinowitz said at the end, "that I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have a premise on this job.
We serve unpretentious companies.
But a certain kind of sensitivity that is simply friendly and praiseworthy about itself can sometimes justify judgment, as you have pointed out.
Obviously you are themselves proposed against the church - things that you call "hard" and "brothal" could be interpreted by others as expressions of natural power and energy.
Always solve CO SE STALO, KDYBYS IT STALO, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, prepares a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
In his head, he looked at the recommendations made by Offnow to the world in the last quarter or more.
Smile at your neighbor, listen to your partner, listen to the ballast, go to the music, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than talking, singing is better than writing, but there is nothing better than love.
"I just understand your rewards," answered those Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure that her overrun was over, "and I am no longer saying that the morning didn't last as we thought she was asleep.
My main concern is that if we are not previously warned about this, we repeat the same mistake that led to the CO-SE STALO, KDYBYBY THAT STALO.
This time, however, we're not gonna ventilate on others.
Luther Rabinowitz gathered the ends of his fingers.
That should mean enduring forever.
"You live too far," he said, "if the steps you may have taken and may not have done your ancestors, you describe as a mistake.
You're going to be far away from talking about how they ventilated their "dangerous" and "unbelieving" on the "other."
I should not remind anyone at your place that in understanding the past and in protecting our presence, we are not talking about "we" and "them."
There was no "we" and there was no "they."
All we know is that it's about Chaotic times.
"During those who, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme picked up the courage, "we're not innocent.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, it happened.
It was before.
That's not what we agree to.
And just as there is no wine that would be given to someone, there are no things that should be made, even if the arrangement was appropriate and possible.
But what is the matter with us that we may learn from it?
There's a minority there to forget about it.
If I can add something to it...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his fingertips.
"I will take your message into account," he said and abandoned it.
The day after she went to work as usual, she found a motorcyclist who hired a driver in a way that the traveling travelers described as “a fraternal and painful. ”
The results are happening.
The army of the Lesoth kingdom claims that no plot is planned - the president of the government remains in South Africa
The military officials of the Lesoth Kingdom announced that they would organize a campaign to overthrow the government, claiming they were opposed to the police suspected of trying to contain political fanatics.
The president of the government, Thomas Thabane, fled the country and said that the army seized his official seat and built a government building in the capital of Maser.
After he announced that he was threatened with death, the prime minister took his family to the neighboring South African Republic.
The spokesman of the army, Major Ntle Ntoi, said that in fact there was not much of a difference, but the response of the army to the "political fanatics", which the police tried to put out.
"Today, this morning, the ruling of the defenses of the Kingdom of Lesotho, was followed by a number of reports of information services, that in a number of police ranks, there are several groups that plan to combat some radical, political fanatics that have sought to take place in the country of the desert," said the Voice of America.
The South African government Clayson Monela said military actions seemed to be an attempt to disrupt the government.
"Although no one has declared that the government has acquired power by means of force, according to all, the actions of the Lesothian defence components are not a sign of state conversion," he said.
The military representatives of the Lesoth kingdom said that the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sundays and stayed in the main city.
During Thaban's absence, the government will be responsible vice-president Mothetjoa Metsing.
Thabane declared that, according to his view, there was an ongoing attack on my efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane has stopped sitting in Parliament because of internal disputes, he is in Lesotho.
He declared that even through a false claim, he would not undermine his government.
The product in the euro area is at a minimum of three months
The growth of the product was reduced to a minimum of three months, according to a closely monitored study in August in the euro area.
Final index of purchase managers in the euro area (PMI) of the June 51,8 clauses in August to 50,7.
The number greater than 50 means expansion.
New orders have been executed and the company has damaged growing tension between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The figures are from the fourth meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank, how to deal with remote euro area treatment and the risk of inflation at 0.3 %.
The speculation was expressed that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States had experienced during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, a rapid effect which has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the producer, it is still more visible," said Rob Dobson, Markit's main economy.
The German manufacturing PMI, the largest trade partner in Russia in the EU, fell to a minimum of 51,4 per month.
In the second largest economy in the area, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
Concerned about France, Italy has again gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs of the decline in the strength of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands have also disappeared, and it is not too comforting," Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to lead to oil to fire by analytics expected to be implemented by other mining or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, head of the IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the product review of purchase managers is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
Addendum: Producers in the euro area have a very complex life at present because increasing geopolitical pressures - especially between Russia and Ukraine - are contributing to further insecurity in many countries.
This growing uncertainty of trade has become evident - and above all, the confidence of consumers, which is likely to cause some orders to be rejected or even deleted, especially the cost.
He pointed out that, as "more likely" he argued, the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative release, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of training for survivors from Beslana: Ten years since the game with the children's scattered school still suffers
Ten years ago, the Czech radicals at school in Beslan in southern Russia were held as a handcuff for thousands of people
During the three and a half days of suffering and the shock of the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half were children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who, during the ceremony at school, escaped death.
Just ten years after the horrors of the school in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, were threatened by survivors of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they attacked and killed fanatical terrorist children and parents, it seemed to be the most deep down in hell.
The resistance to tragedy combined the east and west, which led to the triumph and future of this disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to look for some of the victims who had survived death during the ceremony at school.
We've found wonderful young people who have experienced unhappiness, even though the memory of a hell of terrorists will continue to live in them.
What is their greatest wish?
So that the war that now deniates Ukraine - and the children like them - is over.
Girl trying to get back to the destroyed school gym
She was caught by the former Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as she tried to get back to the bombed school gym after the bomb exploded in her.
Aida's suspect was looking for her mother, Laris, who is now fourteen.
You're worried they're both dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida a few times.
I had legs from blood.
I got up and walked back to find my mom.
She was saved by soldiers.
After several operations, she thought she was getting better, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go to another operation.
My knees were stuck in the mud.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people like doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but definitely didn't destroy it," she said determinedly.
"It just happened to me and it can't change.
One year I'm going to the gym to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to friends about it.
This disease is very serious.
My best friend and future partner from the J. G.A. was killed there.
We played small games together and imagined how we would go to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten her engagement, but her memories are a little blue every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the Internet like a school window, I say that a lot of people will see it first, understand that disaster and prevent it from coming back.
A boy who ran away with a knife and believed his mother was dead.
It was his first day of school (in Russia children start school in seven years) and he survived the graduation of his mother, Tamary.
At the time, a seven - year - old said: “My mother told me that if an explosion occurred, I would lie down and hold her by the hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Get out of here."
He was afraid that he was dead, ran away, saw the payrolls, fell down a child by his hand, and ran a spruce.
His father, Vladimir, who got him out, said: “Damir told me his mother is dead.
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara felt free and lay in a hospital with a broken leg and thought that her son had died.
After the meeting again, she said: “I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and killed me.
Damir then flew to London (based on the missing news of the World), where he was the next Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, were declared a winner of Bernardo's Children.
"This noise comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are already blue.
I remember right after that, I put all my guns on the game.
But today, I can play computer games that shoots, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the body, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played at the door and who didn't get out.
We'll never say they killed her or died.
We say they stayed in the body.
On a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I was able to choose anything I wanted, and how I ate a cabriot.
But now he's afraid of a place like Ukraine, where for war he's suffering the same as he and his friends.
This mess gets back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am very sorry for everyone who has to go through such a horror," says Damir, who has participated in volunteer activities in the monastery last week.
I want to be very helpful.
I want to work with the police once, and I hope they'll take me to the Academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “When 37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember that quiet right after the attack, there were no kids who would scream and run around here, and it took a few months.
He remembers his life on the road with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her commitment to the price made and to be able to go south to London in 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a taste for the bottle, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember how he played with the press in the restaurant, Damir shot them with a water gun and they ran and played with him.
And it was just a month from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She says: “I still feel that the world has not changed for the better over the past ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think there's gonna be a lot of children killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in the news that they hear when they offer or do something else.
I know what these people live for, what they're afraid of.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people always want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up, and he's kind and quiet, he's not even aggressive or vengeful.
For example, he doesn't blame himself, he doesn't care.
I know it doesn't matter, but it's very close to six employees, and it's time to go to the body and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with that, and I remember how he used to lie on his face with a face removed from us, and sometimes he slept that way.
He didn't sleep. He had eyes open.
I also remember that he threw all his guns or other weapons into the game. Damir's 17 is higher than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can't believe I've been dead for a few hours, and I've never seen him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and stood on my feet, I looked around and saw that hell, the bones of the human body were lying everywhere.
I was just sure my boy didn't have this fucking chance to survive.
"I remember how I cried 'Damire, run, run!' but I was convinced he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life is different from that of others.
Ilyn’s Grigory, 17
A boy whose shot after the attack became a symbol of a game in Beslan
Flights: Live with Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, today's Grigory device
When he fled for life after the Czech terrorist shot his colleagues, he was in his bloody face terrified.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the beast in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, took him to school the first day and rushed to take his oldest son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorist broke into the door, so my boy stayed there for three days," she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had neighbors there, but everyone died there.
He only survived my Grigory.
As the date approaches, it's still harder to think and talk about it.
Neuplyn's not even one day so we don't remember this tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still reminiscent of: Photo Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was celebrated as salt (right)
I remember how Grigory went to school that day, saying he wanted to cover up his teacher.
That he's alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino, there's even the salt of Grigory's payout.
Grigory looks at the picture and we've got her hidden in the library.
I understand that, but I also think that this picture makes people all over the world know what pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important not to repeat this.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the threat of war in Ukraine.
Do we ever find out what the cause was?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening because if people ask you, no one wants war as much as possible?
Ten years is nothing for such a disease.
At least to forget it, it takes ten years.
It had an effect on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years ago, I had a night shift, but then it got better.
Then, when I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and colleagues who were killed.
So when it's close to September 1, I'm going to the body.
I want to remember a childhood friend.
It's hard for me to get into that body, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is the past.
I don't forget that, but I don't complain.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiovascular surgeon.
I wanted to go into the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but because of my health, I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Gorgori Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived, even though he was held in the hands of a killer terrorist
A miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held in the hands of a killer terrorist during the attack, yet he managed to survive
When the attack was in full passage, he was caught in a physical prison as he sat next to a bomb in the head of a killer terrorist.
It's a real surprise he survived.
"It seems to us as if it were yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but for the injury he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I've been holding my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that kids can handle bad experiences better - I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I went to psychologists and then I was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, it was the first and last time I entered the body again.
I was thinking.
I'll never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Lifetime: Gregory Farniev today, on notebook his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
This disease is massive and they're not with them every day.
Friends know I don't like thinking or talking about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knees that I've broken, but I'm walking normally.
But I couldn't get up and study at the FBS Academy in Petrohrad as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and I answered that it was not possible.
My other favorites are animals, so I got into the vet.
I spent another year there.
It learns how to treat all animals from the "cock by dogs".
He said: “I know that I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something kids should know about, and it's not something they should live for anymore.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This disease will continue here.
He's inside and he's messing with his next birthday.
I'm taking part in the memorial ceremony.
I know Grigory's not coming.
It must be even stronger for him because he was different from me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful that he brought it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's grown up today, but he's not here anymore.
It's hard to accept if something so terrible happens to you.
He's a guy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his bike.
He's been under several operations, he can go, but he can't dance.
I'd say that from 50% he's already overcome the fear, but to overcome it completely and forget it won't.
This terrible experience with us will continue.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed, and the pain only got worse.
I lost a lot of people I liked and those who were close to me.
My son is with me and it's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me to lose those who are killed.
I know the families in which other children were born, but also the widow who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how little my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world -- wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The storm is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could get all those rebels together and guess what they're going to do, it's like he's not going to.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child brought to safety by a special command
Saved: Allyon Tskaev leads to a secure Russian special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy
In 2004, the world was on fire when a Russian police officer took Alyon out of the hands of a small Russian police officer.
The terrorists left her, however, in the school gymnasium, leaving her thirty-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristi and brother Makhra.
The Makhar, who had been alone for three years at the time, was single, Alyonina's mother and sister died at the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan was remarried and married to his new wife, Lightlan, who had a daughter named Kristina after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, is not aware of the attack and has grown up with her assailant and happy girl.
A close friend declared that “it is a great happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from the memory that the ten-year-olds remember.
You can understand why.

4 types how to manage better photos and videos under the water
If you are interested in focusing or swimming under the water, you have a great choice of equipment.
The easiest option is a compact like Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a goPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which is about $300.
I ordered these photos to the family celebration of a few photographs, all of them remained less than $350.
It's one of the equipment you use, but there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are closed.
Next you can set up the camera according to what type of photo or video you will post.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scene or tracking mode that optimises the exposure to the dark environment under the water.
And before you get into it, you'll find out how deep you can get to your equipment.
Some cameras are only assigned to 5 steps, another to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in normal and water-based implementation.
Always make a few photos - a lot of them won't come out.
Compact cameras have LCDs that can help you with composite photos, but the outsiders don't have it.
Even if you have LCDs, it will be bad to see under the water and the composition of the closure will be invisible.
So always make more pictures.
If there's a camera of the braking system that makes a series of photos with a slightly different range of exposure, use it.
Stay close to the cold.
With a deeper sense of light, he's clearly tired.
If possible, stay in the swimming pool, lake or sea near the cold.
It will also allow you to get more light on the photos - the deeper you fall, the less color you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
It's an excellent advice if you take photos of the dust, but under water is even more important because of the darker light.
This is especially important if you connect with the output camera: Such devices usually have a strong and wide range of buttons, which means that if you want to fill the camera, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality power was able to change things even in such a vast organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he advised his career to relieve the patient of the disease caused by weakness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who looked for his help was the MI6, who had to live with the consequences of the torture that had tortured him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disability, patients treated in the wood most are completely interested in something else: disease.
One day in 2007, however, it was the one who started to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt like I had no energy.
He went down with the signs of the flu and found that he was impatient and his wife Juliet included the results.
He said, “I want you to do it before you do it later.”
When Juliet left for a week in the ministry, Lawson was unusual and unexplained.
Something was wrong.
His colleague's been doing the X-ray.
Two weeks ago he was lying in the French Alps.
The X-ray results came.
He had a mesothelial, an inexhaustible burden, which would be a backbone or if a plate would come out.
In most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some cooks will get cancer of the lung, not all patients with cancer of the lung have been burned.
Mesotellium is different.
In all cases, it is the cause of the construction of the azbet - a building material that was previously designated as a “speech” but today it is known that it is fatally dangerous.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore.
Asbest, the end, is the past.
The most dangerous type of azbet has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when it entered into force on the ban on the use of azbet in the industry.
And in the time of the use of abbet, only certain groups of people, such as insulation contractors, builders, treasurers and shipowners, came into contact with him.
Toxin used in the industry in the other summer is hard to be seen today as a reason for fear.
It's kind of self-sustainment, but it's not on the spot.
As you can see, in Britain today, the mesotellium epidemic is rising.
The number of deaths on mesotheles is here higher than any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per patient per year are twice as many as the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths due to mesothelioma per year since 1980 and expected death in the future in Great Britain
The reason why we feel its effects right now, although the use of azbet has been illegal for years (all kinds of azbets were finally banned in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades to develop them.
The mass in the form of mesothelioma is not only of the veterans of the construction industry.
Azbest was, and in many cases he is still present in the homes we live in, in the offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in the shops we buy.
Thus, the mesothelioma does not respect the social class, the wealth, the call, or the age.
Privileged crops from London’s business houses after public schools do not represent cover.
Parliament is also full of ambition.
Even patients who should treat us are responsible for this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even give up on the isolates.
He was trying to find out where he could get in touch with Azbet.
Then he came to it.
"It is possible that a lot of azbeests were in the subterranean streets of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, sisters, doctors and door - walkers used.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, this was a question that he could partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who have been exposed to mesotellel in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only person I've ever lived."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothel when he was 48.
When he died at 17 this year, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis is not normal for so long.
55% of people diagnosed with mesothelyl die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are sick with the same disability? ”
According to former British experts at Professor Julian Peta's mesotell, the best idea is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbeest epidemic occurs in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them do not at present feel that they will die this way.
Azabesto land in Quebec, Canada
A regular look at the records from the archives of the courts, on which the findings are often translated and demanded comparison, shows how much the mesothelomatic group has expanded.
For example, this red one acknowledged Marks & Spencer that she had been the victim of Janice Allen from distress.
For the racer she worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she was seen in two sales in the clothing section - one of the places was a train ship, a trade at Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18, when he started working for M&S.
Today, he has two children who are over twenty.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesotellium before, I barely knew anything about the asbesty.
I never thought in my dream that something could have happened to me.
There's not much people who know about the asbesty.
Actually, azbet is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
His name was given thanks to his fibrosis structure, which gives him strength and courage.
Three of the six minerals were used in the building.
Most often today, in buildings, it is possible to find chryzothol, commonly known as white azbet.
It was used in the air panels, the floor floorings, the balleric closets, and even in the air conditioning.
It is not as deadly as other forms of azbet, the EU and WHO still consider it a “high health risk” that can cause death.
The most dangerous, however, is iron azbest (mosit) and blue azbet (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of cheap asbesty, and experts claim that “there is convincing but unbiased evidence that this was the main cause of the unusual high level of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]."
The employee Mark & Spencer was an asbetted in a train sale in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Juliana Peta's work shows that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients says that “the substantial part of the cases of mesothelioma with no known exposure to asthma at work or at home was probably caused by exposure of azbet in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is the "normal use and expansion" building.
Looks like no one can be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that not even people in the central government need not know that they may be set up asbesty.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that the official emissions and attempts by parliamentary committees were contaminated by the azobetes whose deadly flue could be contaminated by something as harmful as "a severe air pass."
Ministers are often accused of seeking only their own interests, but in this case it can be true again.
Despite the fact that the Parliament's Services Office has continued to receive the Westminster Palace's "failure medical certificate", it is now estimated that it will require a million free and several years of work for Parliament to be thoroughly monitored, updated and removed by electricity, and that after the elections in 2015 it will be more than in the green valleys of Westminster to sit in the premises of the Conference Centre of King Alžbæty II.
In the report of Goddarda, it is said that “the presence of the azbet is not in accordance with a number of regulations.”
It's not possible to say that this mess will be a life.
Everyone can just wait now.
One of the people who had never been able to determine when they came to the Azbez exhibit was Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) has a suspicion that he was exposed to asthma at work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where there was evidence of the presence of an azbet," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
It is clear, however, that it is remembered on the day of the beginning of December 2009, when something like winter caught it.
He was 45, he was at night, and he was in the middle of surgery.
I just got upset.
It's coming back.
It was terrible.
I thought I'd never get home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was coming from the grave, the explosions around the throat.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to think he was talking about mesotheles.
He's been home for a month.
The suspect's doctors made him a spinal cord, and they put in his chest catheter to remove the fluid that they sent to the poll.
They haven't been diagnosed yet.
His attitude gradually improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms came back, often after what you had grown up and passed away.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and subsequently was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
At the same time, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and came to work in direct contact with the azbet.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition was again compromised and his doctor consulted his CT photo and X-ray with the expert panel.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he was placed in the space between the sound of the wall and the sound of the sound of the sound of the camera.
I'm optimistic.
I have a tendency to be very jealous," she says.
To be honest, I didn't take care of it.
But Rachel, my wife, you were old.
The results of the biopsies reached between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was mesothel. ”
Graham Abbott: Diagnostic with mesothelium
Abbott began to contact the sister from the charity organization Macmillan and one advised him to contact the lawyer.
At this point, you knew the extent of the epidemic.
"It has been shown that azbet has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have a warm azbet isolated in the soil," he says.
In the people who were exposed in these buildings, disease is now beginning to develop.
Mesothelium is now being affected by young people who do not have a risk call.
The most dangerous tubes that were heat-insulated with azabetes were found in the hospitals in the suteeren, so it was unlikely that patients would be threatened.
All members of the staff who crossed the sidewalks (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the sidewalks (as often as Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As is now shown, several decades after the war of the hospital were a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
The Azbez is removed today.
Bunsen's kahan was built on the asbestos.
And it's not just about the hospital.
Azbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and workshops because of its excellent isolation and non-recovery properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, a lot of people were already in school.
Sometime in countless hours of chemistry, students have set up Bunsen's kahan on an asbetto base.
Web sites that have been asked about Azbez at school have been raised.
Bad things, such as low - lying or high - pitched fires on our homes, have often included azobets.
"It's about industrial food built into a large number of homes," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who filed Andrew Lawson's complaint against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with the azbet, on which the woman suffered from mesothelium was to mention, was in the 70s when she was attacked by a garden.
So watch how you fight the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of diagnosis is enormous.
"It will take a while before it comes to you," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go out and settle down with myself.
Well, I can't get along with the next Friday.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
He remembers how he felt confused with the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand everything," she says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long does it last for me?’
I was told twelve months ago.
I remember saying to myself: “Well, I don’t get any more wine.
That's it."
Mezotelium is particularly destructive because the only mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to azbets.
Azbeth makes a little hairy.
When the azbet is broken and the train is blown up, they can rely on the ground floor, the blast of the ball.
Azbet's hair dryer is a dragon and can cause mutation of the bunker.
"The problem is that the axebetic hair is reflected in the shape of a needle," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiovascular surgeon who arrived in Guy's Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asthma, which is a paradox leading center in mesothellium treatment.
Treasure Lawson is known and has also been treated with other patients who have been shown asbesthetally probably during practice in the hospital.
If the azobetics get into the mud, says Treasure, and “sudden breathing is pressed on the edge where the exposure is located.
His behavior is invasive from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options used in other types of cancers do not take so much on mesotheliles.
For example, there is a lot of discussion about the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, she'd be trying.
Treasures do not agree.
"You can't remove the trash," he says.
You don't have enough shoes around.
The cancer “does not respond to chemotherapy” that “has some effect” but does not cure.
"Someone who survives cancer," says Treasure.
But everyone will eventually die.
Fortunately, some patients live far longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After finding the mesotellium, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual assistant and consultant for the same people.
When they called, he said, "Good day, you're allowed to go to the center of the cancer."
"It was very positive," says Abbott.
His disease was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
At the start of Abbott, six cycles of chemotherapy would last for four months, and his life would probably only last a month.
"I was confident," she says.
I wanted to give it up.
Lawson, however, "has been able to show things in more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of brain surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I was lucky I didn't wait until I was sent to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get a request and have to accept a reward.
In order to get the best available treatment, there is a key to money for patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments eventually do not necessarily fail, many patients face another financial age - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgana with Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"From 1898 it was known that azobetes is harmful health," says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we're meeting with a company of poor people.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital were finally created, but Morgan said it wasn't "full-scale equation," because Lawson could not definitively prove that mesothelians were the result of azbest exposure to Guy's Hospital.
However, after examining the case, the speaker Guy's Hospital confirmed that "freedom was removed in the criminal subcontinent in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove azabest
The loss of exposure to a dead asbesty at one company or place of work - usually ten years after what happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothely active compensating.
Many of the former jobs have changed their owners or went bankrupt.
The evidence was lost.
And those who are now charged with defense have their time on their side, which their claimants are certainly not.
In response to this fact, a new legislation was adopted this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelilus to get rid of it, even if it is not possible for their former employer to check.
The law created a 350 million financial reserve, which builds insurance and is designated by people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to absbet but have no one to complain about.
In such a case, 80 % of the amounts that would normally be added to the court would be equal to approximately 120 000 libres.
Every year 300 successful applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan feels like patients with mesothelytics that 350 million free is "good work".
"It is an agreement signed with insurance insurance," she says and indicates that the sum is a fourth of what insurance policy should be paid if it does not take time and people with mesothelioma would be able to monitor existing employees and normally complain about it.
Even Mike Penning, former minister of work and social affairs, admitted that the law "had a lot of measles."
But Penning and Morgan agree that since the seven deaths each year, there was a need for rapid contact.
"People are too patient and they need help right away," Penning said in the spring of last year during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended that he have a positive effect on the difference between Tom Treasura and Tom.
After surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed - a three-year treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can be treated peacefully for up to 40% of patients.
Abbott did it.
"Of course this is not the most important thing," says Abbott.
You're still seeing it in patients.
There's something moving you.
If you give up, your attitude can get worse.
Graham Abbott undertook an operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Control visits did not show any signs of failure.
I went to the next check in March [2014].
In my chest, I had a couple of broken ribs.
My fifteenth birthday was just about to come.
It doesn't endanger that life.
Here you go.
Abbott re-submitted six cycles of chemotherapy.
At the present time, there are no feet of pride in his body.
But it's a physical and emotional draining process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial insurance when I die, or about showing women how the building works.
When you learn bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," she says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girl that my attitude means I'll never be old.
Their reactions were different.
There's a lot of social and wildness in there.
She told her friends and we started calling a lot of people right away.
Ellie was more stable.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients should be consulted in such discussions.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such discussions are not delayed or only a sign of chance to survive.
The disease brings itself (and finally brings Stephen Jay Gold's) unpleasant security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "life is not a threat to the environment."

The prohibition on imports of blue Azbek
The Court of Appeal shall confirm the first successful claim for a health claim following the exposure of Azbez in Britain.
The world industry is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tons annually.
The United Kingdom brings 139,000 tons.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires that all adders of azbets have licences.
Imports and use of blue and yellow azbets are prohibited by the British law.
In Britain, the use of all kinds of azbets is prohibited.
In the United Kingdom, the law on mesothelioma is applicable.
A 350 million compensation programme has been launched.
Azbest is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white Azbeth continues to be used as a cheap building material.
The world's production is kept at two million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leadership - demonstrators promise instead
The Chinese Parliament, despite much debate on democratic reform on Sunday, decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to designate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will lead to long-standing protests in the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, as the activists began to organize and only a few hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress basically allows Communist leaders to order any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it made us angry," said Lawyer Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear that we have something to do with the authoritarian regime.
In the defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of Li Fei said that making public nominations in Hong Kong elections would make “chaos”.
Since 1997, when Britain has returned to Hong Kong's government China, Beijing promises that by 2017, citizens will be able to love their power.
The Chinese leaders presented a non-democratic decision, because Hong Kong allows for direct vote, but also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders are firmly in the process of appointing the committee, which is closely controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clauses, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be eligible.
The decision came after the summer months, which marked one of the largest and most followed protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the hunger of the Centre for Love and Peace, which the organizers threatened to close the financial quarter if Peking does not give them a general voting right.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of victims gathered in the Occupation hall in the rain before the Hong Kong government.
In the demonstration, the organizers announced that their teeth are entering the new phase of civil disobedience and that protests are taking place in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online announcement, the organizers said that the strike "considered the Centre's occupation only as the last step in the event that all the possibilities for dialogue were exhausted and no other vote would arise.
We need to inform the police that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the centre's containment is inevitable.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcements all day and have strengthened the government's seat protection on Sunday and have released police and baricads.
Many Hong Kong residents say that there is a lack of control over the city.
The presence of strong people increases competition in the area of products and services.
There is also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being promoted by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Kopace Centre's reputation and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - a saved member of Hong Kong.
"The protest that he is talking about could cause much more economic damage according to how many people are involved and how long," says political Regina Ip, who long-term criticism.
We don't want to raise concerns about Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such an investment could damage investment.
China's state media has also come in recent days with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong describe as subcontracting agents in the West Bank.
In the summer, the informal referendum on voting rights was organised by 780,000 participants - more than five votes in Hong Kong.
And in June tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
A probational agent?
The League in Jihlava has a political reputation
A small bath is played in the national city of Upocchi, about 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is a new name for the Jilah League.
The name was obtained by one node that goes to regular municipal elections.
The tenth of his candidates is the head of a small copy in Jihlav Jan Mrák.
"There was a wave of mobs where there was no problem," said Mark.
As far as the first small copies were concerned, the lawmakers of the Jihlavic Chamber had already been arrested and recommended to change the system of distribution of applications.
A little cop got a Loni from the city's website about a million crowns.
And this year it's about a quarter of a thousand.
According to the legal opinion, there is no procedure for small copies in dispute with the law or the guidelines of the Magistrate.
The situation is, however, for the Authority, for the purpose of adjusting the rules for grant and grant allocation," said Radek Tulis, a linguist.
Cut the grant from the city and at the same time express as a small cup of political support in one party's elections, it will probably not come.
A similar policy requirement has not yet been reached on high-level "great" football.
That ČSSD should be issued a national audit, ODS division or KDU-CSL 1.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for it.
On the contrary, I would like to be approached by sponsors from a number of companies," said the president of the national football club Miroslav Vráček.
The head of the small football team of other parties and the gang member of the league will not leave
According to the players, this sport in Jihlava would serve its own area with six floors, shats and social equipment.
"For example, the garden At Stoopach is not ours, we're in the hotel," warned Andrej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlav's club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mile.
But there will be, for example, an unintended area for skiers, which is likely to fall in Jihlav," Måka warned.
Prime Minister Jihlav Vymazal (ODS) responded that a small cup of coffee uses a garden with an artificial grass in the streets of Rošic and Na Stoopach, which are in the possession of the city.
We want to build a place that has maximum use.
We want to modernise or build a gym in schools that will be available in the afternoon hours.
I think he's made huge progress in recent years for a little digging," Vymazal added.
Another political party in the names of the law does not appear according to Jan Måky.
We have limitations.
If someone from one camp enters our partnership, we're not giving one another any more," he explained.
"The political momentum in the name of the League, I consider it to be at least an unfortunate step," said a member of the Committee for Sport Karel Voldan.
"But please consider whether Mr. Mrákka is using a small-scale village of Jilah and the supply of cities for political purposes, or not," he added.
America's tradition leads to university life - the first can be seen by a Turkish plane
We are pleased that we can respond to the request by submitting the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
For the purpose of leaving the best income when entering university, the company also offers the possibility of transporting a private driver or a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 vehicle.
Stewart also announced that the service has its own security site.
Service is an ideal option for students who, otherwise, have to carry their things across the whole state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are pleased that with our VIF (very important fresher – very important first) options for students this year, we will ensure that the university has a minimum of nervousness and maximum luxury.
The company said that since the services were first released, they still had no reservations, but he added: “The students will start making reservations within the next few weeks. ”
The company also pointed out that although students pay an annual school fee of up to 9,000 pounds, it is expected that the service will find its place in the market.
In comparison with students ten, twenty, thirty or four years ago, students are different today, as regards expectations and requests - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF programme is exactly the appropriate way to do so.
The National Union of Students, however, criticised the service as inexplicable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “To most students, such a project is impossible.
Many students who attend this month's university have to deal with the financial crisis before thousands are released for something as simple as getting on the road, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot take the steps that are at the expense of basic needs.
Feminists in the wake of the events in Ferguson are against racism and police conduct
At the beginning of the month, he killed a police officer in Ferguson in Missouri, an unarmed young man.
A host waiting at the top of the stairs shouts: “Hush up, don't shoot!
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri due to the shooting of unarmed young Michael Browna, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz wrote a statement in the online discussions of white women.
She found that when it comes to the exercise of reproductive rights and equality of income, white feminists take the lead in sex before race.
With growing emphasis on the Middle East, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perés has seen that the reaction of the whites is based on race in 100 %.
In comparison with the blacks soon after the shooting on 9 August, personal articles with the inscriptions as "Feminismus is not only about women's rape" were found relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this is an important change.
"I don't think there's a lot of people in feminist famine who would talk about race and excellence at such a level," she said.
People felt that what happened had to be expressed.
For the crisis we are facing, it is characteristic, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so richly rewarded that they have to pay attention to it.
According to English professors at the state university in Ohio Korthy Mitchell, Ferguson brought out the problems that Africans must face every day and that in the cultural sphere they are not considered "female questions".
"I can publish funny stories from life with my partner on Facebook and get 150 people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the color in their own country, it's quiet to hear.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relations, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black people like Mitchell, who lived on the question of race, sex and sex in American history, there is no difference between race issues and dichotomy.
The Blacks said they couldn't get luxury to share these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Despite today's white issue of race and sex in the mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of female questions and gardening studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the same.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were thrown away and the reason was almost in all cases the rape of whites," Hattery said.
You needed to cooperate with white people to justify the disconnection.
According to Hattery's settlement between whites and blacks, he came when the fighters for the electoral law, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined at the end of the 19th century and realized that the electoral law could have only one group of people - women or blacks.
"They decided to put the cards on the voting rights for women and the right for black people to focus later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important view of why colorful women do not believe in Him.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
And after women gained voluntary rights in 1920, ten years passed before they started organizing the association of South Asian women for the prevention of abortion.
The group was 40 years after what the Blackman first said about aid.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the issues that have been raised in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "come" questions that the blacks had to deal with.
"It wouldn't be great if activists in these spaces [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they did the right to an anti-concept?" said Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists who have done their career in the fight against reproductive rights and access to anticonceptives now find out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Browna shot on Facebook, where they published Rebecca Carroll's from Guardian, who demanded that the white Americans protest more differently against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but still similar reasons for understanding danger in society - and views on race that are significantly better in public opinion - will be forced to change," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem's intersectal feminism, which includes questions of race and sex, has its comments on the question of race in America.
A team of American Enterprise Institute Christina Summers, author of the book “Who stole feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men, are “a lot more vulnerable than their sisters”, but the notes of Steinem’s side Ferguson are the criticisms that have already developed.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program My Brother's Keeper, which had helped vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it was developed in many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's deliberate reaction.
The relationship of the police to the Black Community is not the only problem that comes before the interests of mainstream feminism.
After the American foreign police held this year on the south-west of the country about 63,000 young people, a question of reform of immigration laws arose again – this time as a female issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for the reform of immigration laws, said that it would be possible to present a question as a matter of necessity for women, the only thing she had to do was to share the story of an immigrant.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercado.
In view of the fact that most employment permits are granted to men, women who come with them are considered to be vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a voice in women's organizations," she said.
You live in Ipswichi for sale
The real office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, she was resting on it in the trunk.
A unique home for sale of 120 000 pounds is on a private trip to Ipswichi.
The information photographs included the picture of the living room in which it rest with its head on the sandy sand.
The real Connells office indicated that the dog on the photo is a pet pet.
"The photo was wrong there, and that's why it was removed," said the spokesman of the office.
In the information about property, real office Connells described the prayer as "one single single single-room house."
Although the photo office has already removed it from its websites, it remains visible in propaganda materials.
The sale of the house attracted interest on social networks where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After the win in the lottery, Harvey's city is on the south side of a fresh millionaire.
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
He spends his spare time after a new millionaire on the southeastern of Perth, a lucky man who brings $1.1 million on Saturday's lottery.
Traffic in Harvey was already under way for five years, and in November 2009, a million-dollar prize was awarded.
Well, that's right, but you have to sign up first.
The business owner Steve Forward said he's talking about the game all over the city on the south side of Perth.
It's the main theme, and everyone's a solution.
We thought a similar prize was on the dock.
Eight winners in Western Australia won one victory last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend a player in Canning Vale became one of five Serbian millionaires and just a few weeks ago in Belmont won an incredible 7.5 million dollars.
The winding couple sat down for 20 years and said that the prize would enable them to process the world and buy a new house.
A million from Harvey is the only 59th lottery prize in Western Australia this year, totalling $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
They want higher muscles.
In the press release, GDL identified a protest for a warning station for which he willingly chose time off the transport unit.
At the appointed time, the GDL takes the view of many people who return from the weekend to the train during the first working day.
We also think about people coming to work during the day," said the committee meeting on Monday morning in a press release to make a statement.
"Our first pillar should be involved in the first cost transport, less travelling," added the GDL.
DB has not yet published the official response to the statement of findings.
It is not clear how the protest action will affect international rail connections, except for the Czech Republic.
The committees require an increase of five per cent between drivers and two hours of work per week.
At the same time, the average number of drivers is moving depending on the years worked between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand to 1.27 million kroner) per year.
Drivers in DB work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to join the increase in wages when working time is short.
They stress the need to develop the sound assessment of drivers in the same way as in the other railway staff in which DB is not counted at the end of the working week.
It was dangerous for Christ's car to start burning.
That's why the Barum rally ended
What exactly happened?
It was about the water of the material.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like this could happen.
There was no way to fix the challenge provisionally and proceed to the service at a later time, where would the mechanisms replace it?
If we're going to make it right there, yeah.
But we've been waiting for two more times, and it didn't work out.
There's a high temperature and the risk that the car would start burning was great.
I can't afford it.
You've been running five speed tests in full time.
What did you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like a baby.
We were fast, and then I didn't go over the window.
It was all caused by the fact that the car had been pumped more than half a year to be at some level.
The party showed that we had it.
You broke him so you could really think of victory.
I made myself and the car so we were really on the run.
The news didn't come in yesterday.
On the other hand, the result that we could think of was missing.
But it's Barumka.
The tech said no.
You weren't the only one of the spies who had just left the war on the priesthood.
They came out of him and foreign favorites of Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites left?
Yes.
Especially for the monsters, it was a damage because the race ended earlier.
He's been moving on the spy for a long time, Jaromír Tarabus.
He just paid for leaving the track and picked up about two minutes' missing.
How did you feel about his performance?
It's a shame, because he could've repeated a lot of winnings.
Well, he ate the first time.
But Mira also confirmed that we had a good car.
It's very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, although you appeared at the start of Barum rally.
Can you feel a good feeling about driving again to make a regular participant of the racing race?
I'm sure not at this time.
I told Loni that Barumka was my last race, and I didn't get it at all.
I decided I'd eat her again.
It was my late ninety-nine start, and if it's a chance again in a year, I'm probably going to go.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people just got into traffic just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To a certain extent, we started just because of him.
A group of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going to eat.
I wanted to make them happy.
What are you waiting for in Barumce?
The team continues.
Next week, we'll go to the Highway where Robert Adolf will run.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Fabi Honz Sycora from us on this race.
With Mirau, we're waiting for a two-way European race in Switzerland and in Corsica.
That's what we're gonna have to do next year.
Can you point something out?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsic rally belonged to the mystery of the world, you reached your peak in the series.
Don't you want to try the dark trajectory again?
Don't worry.
The oral agreement with the employer can be a problem
You have, however, refused to give your doctor a certificate of work incompatibility which serves as evidence for the organisation that you cannot perform your work duties for health reasons.
You've never known the employees before.
The following came to the agreement that the dates would be stated as permitted, but the agreement was only oral.
Although the labour law does not lay down the obligation to leave an employee’s consent to be confirmed in writing, this procedure has been proven in practice.
If it comes to the oral agreement, you don't have a confirmation agreement.
Later it may be possible to agree with the suspension, as well as in your case, that the absence of a long-term absence may be considered as a reason for the immediate interruption of the labour ratio under § 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a court dispute, your employer is therefore missing proof.
The working balance with you but has not been deleted under § 53, you only have the dates indicated in the schedule as an unlimited absence.
The unaccompanied absence in the accounting list has no equal effect as § 53 (e.g. the inability to take a substantial unemployment insurance), however, the possibility of looking for a new employment is limited.
We recommend you to visit your doctor again and let you confirm in writing that you have actually reached the rate due to which you have been incapacitated (sometimes called "non-schopenko", it's just a doctor's certificate).
When looking for a new job, you can present the above evidence and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to assess whether the submission of a written doctor’s certificate of invalidity has been made, as soon as the employer’s notice or the request for written consent is allowed.
You're dealing with such complexities.
Tony Stewart's accident on the way back
The return on track ended for Tony Stewart only a half-way racer Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart found himself in the middle of the game after he was hit by a real pneumatic train in 172, and the race ended for him.
Stewart brought the lost car to the garage, didn't reveal himself to the reporters and left.
The head of his team Chad Johnston said that the car number 14 is broken, but he will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will be held next weekend.
"I would like to have a better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond, and we'll be sure we'll get more there.
Stewart got to play first in the Sunday night's competition after a ride with Kyle Busche, which required the correct side of his car.
"From today's race we have put hope for a good ending," Johnston said, adding, "it just didn't happen."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was set up and the team was down and ready to leave.
After his car broke down and the other driver died on the train in New York, Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and had to win either a race in Atlanta or the following race in Richmond to take place in the table.
He returned to the race during a tragic accident investigation that killed twenty-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took Stewart during the race.
The authorities said that the investigation of the causes of accidents would take at least two weeks.
Still, it didn't decide whether Stewart would be charged with any charges.
Before the race, a three-way champion was waiting for a warm boost.
Stewart started at 12. At the start of the race, he progressed at 10 and then even at 4.
Then, at the beginning of 122 cars, Busch's car is c.
18 got out of control, got out of the second shot, and got to Stewart, where both of his cars were going to crash.
Stewart went on, but he got to the 21st place.

In 103 parking stations, it receives an annual gross of 12.3 million kroner.
The daily duty for the same locations for the driver of the cab was 150 thousand kroner each year.
He reported on the work of Lucaš Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past, the city was used as a rescue when choosing administrators.
The winner then received a rent of 1000 kroner per year.
She's right, but she's changed.
At the same time, it shall decide on the amount of tender.
"The year since the award of original rental contracts and the initiation of election arrangements has shown that the new procurement system is far more useful and more just for Prague," he says.
The most expensive bottle is On Perštín
The highest price has been offered by interested parties on the streets of Perštín.
It's gonna pay 2.1 million dollars a year.
About 1.5 million new managers paid for places prior to the General House or at the Vaclav Square.
The new rules for renters were adopted at the autumn of 2012 and the original lease contract was announced in the summer of last year.
The election took place in four valleys and a new manager found 29 seats.
We've had to clean up this year in the middle of the year.
We've even released her every time, which led to the practically a second fisherman around the chat.
Then we found Savo.
An incredible path!
Our studios and shelter always shed a lot of wonderful voyeur water.
And it wasn't a girl who did it well, but her grandfather gave it up with his help.
It's been a long time.
She was just like a three-stringed, totally curious, like everything else on a cat, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the summer.
When we stopped the season, of course, we had a drink of water.
When she stayed there for a few months, she deserved it.
It just seemed to us that the water was not going to go any further.
We were wondering if something didn't happen there.
In the place where the crater passed, it was possible to have a little bit of noise, the board didn't even get there, so the opening was sealed with a closet.
Our inspectors confirmed that they had a seizure.
Otherwise there was nothing in the water, and we lighted her down.
So we released her again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we've improved improvised tension around the chest tube.
We've seen strange things in the dark.
He was lying on the ground with some costumes.
That's what it looked like.
And the next thing about who else.
Now it looked like a slender mouse.
In the cave, in the places where the roads are, the grandfathers found, there were other fish!
And heavy ice!
Our conclusion is also clear.
Someone would have said the grandfather had a little bit of a chat.
And he wouldn't be so far away from the truth.
The walls and floor are just an inflated sand, only the ceiling is subsidized.
They're mostly on board.
And the car.
The bed on the beach.
The door with wide borders was opened most of the way someone walked in one corner.
A few already mentioned paths.
No network, so they usually fly birds there and put a nest on the trees.
It's too much to talk about the muscles.
Grandpa wanted it to fly, and that's it.
He didn't even help the air right now.
He's got a whole lot of stuff.
So we cleaned up the whole deal.
Especially that fish on the beach was alive!
We've also gone through the stuff that was around: the dust, the heraklit desktop, and so on.
Our chat in the distance has been welcomed by the surrounding disinfectant department.
We've been thinking about who could have found the unspoiled remains there?
The nearest cat lives two miles from here.
It's hard for her to go to bed with us.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who's not quite fine.
If he didn't give us the useless French way out there?
It's practically all year round, stupid idea, that's what he's got.
We decided to watch and control the students regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, but it's just on the floor and sleeping before the tests are done, but it's already been good.
Tahat water from the forest students is nothing I'd like to do for a while.
One day we heard a horrible horror of protecting our fans.
Mom looked at the balcony and saw it in the back of the garden next to the verandy with a long, strong black coat.
She snuck up on it, and she's smoking like crazy.
Mom gave it up because she thought Réza was gonna win a drop-off shot from her lips.
But at the same time, this bitch partially slipped into the club and partially moved.
There's been a symphony on the balcony.
The line got hysterical to hold.
We went down.
The rope, long over a meter and thick like a bee, tried to form a large hole, and Réza protected her in it.
It wasn't clear whether she wanted to save the gun or if she wanted to take it alone, but it was inappropriate.
When the wolf saw violence like our whole family, she probably said we'd sit down when we're so hungry, and elegantly walked down the path to the castle.
We flew after her.
It's like a blizzard jumps for the stud.
It's just this way that we've recorded on her face the next floating package.
According to the smell of fish.
She wasn't there last night!
Our new security around the corner was a bit of a joke.
And that's what we decided to do over the day.
I'd...
We went out there, and we put each of us on the same road.
We haven't waited a long time.
It's a shame for the students.
First, a flat head with yellow months on the church appeared.
Then she leaned on her neck all the time.
She got around her chest and started getting inside.
The employee who was brought up to work, bought a notebook company and sold it
After his release, the arrested employee bought it to the computer company and then sold it.
The money he earned was still there before the police were arrested.
During a short time, the man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"Notebooks after the transfer took him to Olomouce, where he sold him for the bass," said High Commissioner of the Chumpur Police Rostislav Brücker.
The motive of the riots was that cities were employed for release and also profit money.
"At the hearing he claimed that he used money on credit payments," Brückner said.
The police also found out that the driver was a pathological player who was again treated in psychiatric care.
The money could also be spent in excellent equipment or in video terminals.
"The fact is, we haven't found any money," said the Commissioner.
A lawyer who has been sentenced to theft is now at risk to stay in prison for a year and five years.
The police have not yet reported that they have also been penalized by the bankers who bought the notebooks at the price and have continued to sell them.
"It is true that they have taken over completely new goods, which is minimally suspected," the Commissioner noted.
However, none of the owners of the base were yet charged.
Come on, man, you're gonna do it even if I'm enjoying We Run Prague
This year, our editors have made a few changes.
This was the biggest change in the track that led to the flood goal, instead of bringing her back to the Blue Sea.
At the race, I was happy with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I decided to live it a little longer on the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to treat our readers personally at the stage where we took photos and videos together.
To get my view from the other side to perfection, I took the role of a personal leader.
Together with a friend of Kátáu, we sat quietly at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes before the start.
We greeted friends who walked around us to the faster run.
It's been a long time.
A few rooms on the game, start sports tests, calculation and start!
Early summers, but instead of a quick start, the cap was followed by the start-up stage.
After five minutes, we get to the gate, we're going to stop measuring, and we're going out at ten o'clock.
We're flying with a yellow band of runners who run their first race like Kátá.
At the same time, all the fresh, slightly sloping sun on the surface gives a look at the Vishehrad almost to the naked desire.
The pulsating mass moving across the coast looks like the whole Prague is running here.
On the border between the University and the National Theatre, it is traditionally starting to show who has the strength.
A light coat on the Palac's place will force many runners to slow down or move to the bone.
Just before I move to the Division, I see the police attack and soon after him, most of Paul’s letters are being sent by an incredible storm to the target.
I'm hearing the amazing excitement of the other runners.
I'm moving toward the end of the traffic, I'm pushing him, he's gonna want to cry with me, but before that, he's got his legs stuck, and our hands are cut off.
I'll give you a chance for a short rest and rest.
There's a need, there's a place in front of us that looks like my breath.
The tour of the Manes Bridge shows Prague in the entire beautiful sunset.
I don't breathe and my legs aren't almost alone.
There's a moment of truth for the first nurse.
During the passage of the Kátá train, the schkubrücker is covered with a rope and provides a leap of blue.
I see if she doesn't need help, and I'm going to use a series of exciting words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It's known and we're going on the Kozi street, it's one of the fastest places to walk, in this race there's no such thing anymore, but there's a need to look around.
I still don't know that the idea is the fastest place to get its true meaning later on.
In Prague, we are surrounded by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to communicate with anyone who offers hands, and I'm doing it, too, because ten of the fans are like half of the energy particles.
The fact is, we're speeding it up again and if we're going down pretty well, now we're starting a moving drive.
We pass ten runners, when I have a particularly tired person, I try to wake him up with a few words: "Come on, you'll be fine again, you'll be fine!"
No one's moving us for the last season, we're speeding up.
We've been running for an hour and a fourth, we add, it's okay to wait.
Three kilometers to the target will hurt, but it's really necessary to get away.
The sun has already fallen slowly, and the final day of symbolic darkness is ending the race.
The last escape to the bridge, the circle, and the only line to the target.
The time we're going, I'm surprised where the girl gets into it?
"Come on, let's go in 30 hours, let's do it!" I call.
We'll try it, print it, and it's a goal here.
Thirty-six seconds.
Well, what can be done?
The trainer left for twenty hours.
So seven minutes under the plan.
That's a great result.
That's exactly what Kate's trying to do with her feet, and I'm helping her get some rest.
It's good to see her outings, but she's also happy with the good work done.
I'll take her out of the area for a while.
Euphoria doesn't give us the idea of pressure in the past to the tent.
It's here to see that Kozi street wasn't the fastest place in the world.
It's still here for the flood target, which is estimated to be tens of thousands of rungs bound to the desert.
If someone doesn't like the gift, it's not a place for him.
And after a while I'm losing my head and wondering if you're looking at the beautiful views and giving up last year's interesting track is what's going on.
From my own experience, I know that planning the race is not a game.
If tens of thousands of people are added to this, the rich supply program and closure of the entire Prague centre for all transport is a huge challenge.
The annual change of track showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere in the yellow lakes has been transferred between the race and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the next monsters put it on every meter of track.
During the urban run of the historic centre, however, it must be counted with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the objective of the mass race in a place that is on the one hand protected by the wall and on the other hand, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I appreciate it as much as I'm told.
I had a little fear of the health of those who were involved, but it ended up all right.
Write us to the discussion if you like the trail and what you say about the situation.
High-level audiences in Bulgaria organize protests
Staff members of prison services throughout Bulgaria participated in an international protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia's capital city.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their request for the renewal of the original working conditions that have recently changed.
The list of requirements to be dealt with by the Minister of Justice of Christ Ivanov is also higher.
Months symbolicly protested against the new working time and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-year change.
Although the committees of the prison prosecutors and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they failed to reach out to inform the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The meeting is still running," BNR led by the General Department of Prison services Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Employment Committees will also join the Ministry of the Interior in protest.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we can't see them
Physical well-beingrs don't usually write, but Brian Green, from Columbia University, was hit black in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe became the most accessible road for lying, as it is to discover the forest of problems that are facing a number of theoretical physicss today - trying to combine two great, but mutually incompatible phenomena of the 20th century: quant theory and the theory of general relativity.
One reason for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of a United Physical Theory, there is no real story.
The physical basic problem between two key theories (although at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been resolved and resolved in such a way that it stands for translation and law.
In addition, Greene consulted with the composite material so fresh that he could not calculate how much interest he had in his books.
In addition, he made his "miss" from most of the books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
The author would probably not object to anything if his book were to stop faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years the Elegance universe still provides almost all the essential things that the informed era with ambition should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the next few years, there will be only a few lives in this area (maybe because the LHC accelerator finally eats on the full floor), and so it is a good time to enter the Greens unfathomably open doors of modern physics.
How many dimensions can we have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three space dimensions, of course, can sound travel, fantastic, weird or mystical.
Still, it's concrete and completely friendly.
To understand this, let's take our air away from the universe for a moment as a whole to something far more attractive, in particular to the long and heavy gardening table.
Imagine that you are dragging the stomatian garden cap on one side of the canyon on the other, and you are following the whole scenario from half a mile away (as shown in the picture and on the following page).
From such distance, you can easily record the length of the water-borne haze, but if you don’t just put the bistresrax on, you’ll notice the weight of the haze.
In view of your great distance from your bed, you would think that the bed you've been given to live on the bed has only one size in which you can walk: the left-right size under the bed.
If someone asks you where the darkness was at the moment, answer it with just one indication: the distance from the left or the right end of the hazelnut.
So all we're saying is that from a half mile away, it looks like a long piece of fabric as a unit-size object.
In the real world, there's a lot of pressure.
If we raise everything, we'll look at this second size - in the shape of the circle of the moving beam.
In this enlarged view, it is obvious that the seal can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right size after the length of the tent, but also in "the size of/by direction of the movement of the hour lunches", and by the cross-section of the tent.
You start to understand that to determine the position of a small sailor, you have to assign two numbers: how far from the end of the anchor and where it is on the circle of the moving anchor.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the sheet is double-sized (e.g. experts estimate that this chapter focuses purely on the misleading theory of the page.
Non-responsible aspects shall be provided in Chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the roof is two-dimensional: one long sub-dimensional dimension is marked with a direct tip, the dimension in the direction of the handle, marked with a curved tip, is short and narrow.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size under the hat is long and easy to see.
The size of the running chain is short, "swift" and very famous.
In order to find out the existence of the cross-section, we have to go through the puzzle with a much better solution.
The above example illustrates the importance of space dimensions.
That they're divided into two groups.
They can be big, thin, and therefore very sharp, or rather small, thin and very highly noticeable.
Of course, in that case, we did not change our mind just so that we could see the "svinutou" dimension of the rising pressure of the bed.
You've got enough to help out.
But if the hats were thin -- like the hair or the capillary -- we'd be able to reveal the thin dimension only with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, expressing with a fascinating thought that space geometry could have more than three dimensions known to us.
Its radical claim of Kaluza led to the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can lead to a single, unified concept structure.
At the same time, the question is, how this Kaluza tree goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of the space.
The answer that Kaluza predicted between the order and which clearly expressed and clarified the Swedish mathematics Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls to the conclusion that the space geometry of our universe can have both large and smooth dimensions.
This means that just as the dimension of the length of the tent, our universe has a large, wide and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we realize every moment.
But the analogous with the circle of the garden may have the space and additional dimensions, strongly swirled into the space so unscathed that in the future the secrets remain hidden even before our most perfect experimental devices.
To get a clearer view of the basis of Kaluz's remarkable proposal, let's stay a little longer in the hall.
Imagine we put a black color on the front of the table with a number of rows of circles.
The beams still look like a thin single-sized beam.
With the distance now, thanks to the rotation, we're still able to see the same motive from picture 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the bed is double, with one size large and almost unlimited and with the other short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circle dimension, there are three large space dimensions, together with four superseding dimensions.
It's hard to draw an object with too many sizes.
To help us with our performances a little bit, let's look at the illustration on page 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circle dimension.
In the picture, we're increasing our view of the geometry of the space just like we've increased the surface of the roof.
Each of the following levels represents a large increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have an additional dimension (see them at the fourth level of enlargement), if they are moved to a sufficiently small space; thus we explain that we have not yet observed them directly.
Four networks often highlight the known "great" dimension, while the circles of new, small and thin dimensions.
Just like the smiles in a wide-floating box, these circles exist in every place of normal size - we only drew them to the intersections on the four-line.
The background of Figure 4 is often highlighted by the famous structure of the area - the common world around us - in such common dimensions as meters, marked by the side of the small square in the square network.
In each picture, we will focus on the small area of the picture of the previous one; we will increase it to become visible.
At first, there's nothing special about what we're seeing at some of the first level increases.
However, if we are on our way through the microscopic properties of the geometry of the space further - at the fourth level of the increase in picture 3 - we see this new, along the circle of the silhouette, the same tastes even in the thick layer of copper.
Kaluza and Klein came to the conclusion that the additional cross-sectional dimension exists in every place in the direction of large sizes as well as the length of the cross-section in each point of their length.
In the interest of the observation, we have limited the circle size to a few regularly placed points.
Picture 4 Kaluz and Klein's image of the microscopic structure of the space.
The comparison with the hat is obvious, perhaps we also mention important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, far-reaching space dimensions (of which we have only two), which have only one size of the sky.
Even more importantly, the difference is that we are now talking about space geometry of the universe itself, never just some object inside the universe, we need our curse.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional cross-sectional dimension is extremely miniatural, to recognize it is - just like the cross-section of a tent - much more difficult than to observe the apparent, large and wide dimensions.
If the additional dimension is small enough, it will be revealed in fact and beyond the strength of our most modern enlargement tools.
Most importantly, however, the additional dimension is not only an oblong curve within the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration indicates melodiously.
The red dimension is a new dimension, which exists in each of the three regular dimensions.
It is the size of the remaining three dimensions independent of the same as the sizes of the hair-down, left-right and front-right independent (and third).
A small sailor could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position we would need four data, except three more common positions in the circle dimension; if we count and time, then five data, in each case one more than we normally expect.
Did it bother you?
The book Elegant Universe Briana Greene can be bought here on books.idnes.cz.
The price for the e-book is 149.
To our surprise, then, we find that if we know that there are only three dimensions of the space, Kaluzov and Klein have shown that there is no exception to the existence of additional smooth dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with our own eyes.
How small should they be?
The latest technical equipment will be able to identify the structure of a large billion billion meters.
We can barely take a look at the thinner dimension.
In 1926, Klein’s original Kaluzian idea was combined with a few thoughts from the right to be born quantified mechanics.
His calculations indicated that an additional circle dimension could have about one Planc length, so the size was far from the range of the ability of today's devices.
Since then, physics has called the possibility of additional small space sizes of Kaluzov-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola works as a flower on an electric guitar: Part 5.
The entire substance "twelves" is in a 12-step harmonious form, which you can willingly repeat.
Anyone who's stuck in the music theory will find her principle clearly explained here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
I've been teaching a lecturer and a lecturer whose facebook profile can be followed here, from maturity 20 years ago, lives as a chart.
He's a guitarist, Captain Wohnout, and he can't leave.
The guitarist is after his father, just like his brother Matthew, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on one side.
"The rhythmic model is only for you, you can think of anything, it's enough to apply it to the harmonic model twelve," Honza recommends.
If you add another page, you can change the figure again.
It's enough to listen to and follow Honz what's going to be done with the 12 harmony on both sides and how pretty it's starting to sound.
If you take the third page, you can have some songs with the melody.
When you finally add the fourth, notice the change in the landing, warning Honza in the video.
Next, Honza will return to the pentatonica and try to get her together with the 12th.
So make her a nice flower.
As best as possible, you will read it in a conversation with Jane Homolo in his first lesson at his school game on the electric guitar here.
Another head without waiting?
It's not for great glory, it's a horrendous House.
We take the point and we like him.
The first half we had more chance, the second home," prepared an attacker, who was now hiding from the back door.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but did you just give her a huge piece of shit?
I've noticed, in particular, that, even in the second branch, where domestic fans are, it's probably worse.
You fixed the penalty in half a year, but you're also the head of the penalty, you've got it in just four minutes.
What happened?
We slept first, we were passive, got out of this hole, and then we got a pen.
After her, you got up, and for the first half, you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the switch?
It's hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we've played a good game after the incineration.
We said in the cabin that we wanted to keep the game pace after it, but we couldn't do it.
To tell the truth, I can't explain why.
But it's probably also true that the housekeepers said something about their game, maybe they didn't have much peace with her.
You're the first to hit the counter at the counter, while you're supposed to have not even got your head at home.
Why is it such a difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, but it depends on us how we do it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Plzen, that's another category.
You've been waiting for four shots on your head, didn't you have any fear that this could be the same after the last shot?
It may not even be, but we are very happy that from the past, we do not have to talk about waiting for the head.
Now we've added another one without waiting, but there's only three in six steps, which is not yet on the big glory.
Island - a lion reaches miles from a distant crater.
Lava flying on the surface in the Holuhraun area is a short flight from the Watnajekulull, which connects the underground tunnel with miles away from the crater.
He's under the ice, just like the part of the ground-tweet tunnel.
This reality is now the most disturbing of scientists...
The situation is not going to change.
From yesterday's morning (31.8.
(2014) is still flying from the lungs about the same amount of meat.
However, contrary to the original estimates, the quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
On the contrary, the previous outbreaks of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x greater.
However, the scientists are afraid that the lead tunnel could be opened in places that are under the ice.
If this were to happen, in addition to the same intensity as that predicted by the contemporary eruption, it would mean huge floods, and so on the Jukulsa River at Fjölm, in other words.
In the area of the european, it is a strong smell of cheese, from the trunks are made up of leaves and flowers.
It is clear that it is not suitable for a tourist movement, as it was in the case of an Erup in Fimmvörddahals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is also a lot more rain," volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson says.
However, time has improved significantly since yesterday, in the early hours of the morning, in the area almost airless.
The feet after the singing storm were broken by rain.
The scientists can continue their work.
For air transport, the orange level (the highest level) is paid for Bárdrebung and the yellow (third) for Askju.
The heavens above Chebe belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She's gone on her knees.
The flight day in Chebu.
At the Boeing Stearman PT-17, a plane bomber Peggy Walentin, who flew out of the cabin to the top of the double wing and also between the wheels, was represented.
There's only the power of the waves.
The flight day in Chebu was already running late this year, and the organizers were able to prepare several interesting flight kits again.
The premium on the oldest Czech airport was not only "flying shoes" in giving German acrobatics Peggy Valentine's Day, but also a legendary P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft flight 18.
The man drew his attention to his own selfish desire.
Acrobat called Wingwalking has an origin in the United States.
After World War I, many former warplanes were trying to survive.
Only because of a large number of deaths, he was banned.
But today they're going back to the flight days program a little bit.
Peggy's coming out of the bathroom on the top floor.
There's a variety of cookies there.
At the end of the exhibition, they are moved to the space between the flight corridors where her show continues," Lóděk Matéjěček from the Chebsk Ultraright Club and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot's Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband, Friedrich.
If Peggy's release was the main cause of the program, then the next presentation of the Mustang movement was a historic triumph on the dock.
The legendary movement took place on the surface with the Grippeny Armadas of the Czech Republic in a concentration (so far in figures).
Such a composition could have been seen by flying fans in Czech for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavsky then presented the breath of burning acrobation with a plane from 1945.
He was still made for war, but he probably never participated in it.
He was registered in the military reserve.
He's been in the civil area since 1963.
And as a racing plane.
Today he's got his home hangar on the airport in Munich City.
At the same place there is also another pearl of the Chebsky flight day, two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
He didn't go to the airport to look at the machine.
His detached pelvic path has gone far.
The surprise was also obtained by Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French flight.
The small transport aircraft crashed into the abandoned Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from Hofu to the airport on the day of the flight.
The German neighbors in Chebu presented themselves with reconstructed aircraft like 18T or double formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhywa: Dramatic return before the camera!
The parents ’ age changed Lucie Borhy's at least for today's work evenings.
Stress or nervousness - a blond moderator is obviously not aware of it.
The modernization of the TV news was just as good as it would have been in two months!
It's just two weeks ago, the blonde ended up in six weeks, where women are experiencing the greatest stress after birth.
Lucie, however, will not be shown regularly in the main news account TV Nova.
Regular return awaits her according to information Blesk.cz up to a month.
However, her daughter Linda now needs more than a TV show.
Lucie Borhy came back to the TV screen and it was a black hole.
A year show in Prague?
Halla would sell, she's planning a divorce game.
It would be worthwhile if something like this had happened during the world's mystery.
But it depends on how the struggle is going to be," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition with the name of the Golden Curtain, in which he again met the enchanted Nagan team.
And the players who shared in the gold hack.
The players should like it, right?
I'm sure.
It would soon be good to make a solution to the golden generation during the mystery.
According to me, during the tour he finds one two days when he's completely free and where he'd be allowed to take such a bath.
Let's say that to Gum (Jirím Šlégro) or Bedó Čerban (the director of the Jihlav Savage) who would take it to the age of...
Arena would sell herself.
What if you play with New Jersey play-off?
So if I fly like this...
You don't want to be represented.
Or did the July meeting change your decision?
The representations and exhibitions are two different things and are excellent performances in the representation.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but the results are exciting, especially to the mystery of the world.
There they should drive players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has never changed.
How did you actually enjoy the nagana tracking?
It was just a great meeting with the players.
The man lived his stories and lived a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockeys.
The most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and that there's one generation that really stood for it.
The famous Lener, the Vladimír Róžíčka and Peter Čechmánek on the striker.
You're still going to have your first representative party?
He doesn't remember anything like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we grew up in one three.
For all of this, it was the first representative start.
Well, we'd do it in some way, so you can't say it.
In Jihlav for a long time, Dominic Haszek took it.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me.
I wanted to bring it back to him with that criticism, but I can't (hašek criticised Jagra for reasons why he decided to end up in the representative).
And Hnilicka's got a great idea.
He was right there with me once in the night, and he was a hero there.
And now he's got famos.
First US and then Netherlands, footballists begin to qualify
On Monday, at the funny NH Hotel, the famous guests enjoyed their breakfast.
People could see the need for the branchman Petra Čecha from Chelsea, the representative coach Paul Vrbu...
And over there, it's in a black shirt, it's Tomáš Rosic!
The representative of Arsenal and the captain of the representative arrived at a meeting close to half the last twelve.
We're waiting for a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be pleased?" he said when he was presenting the press in the representative's statement.
Czech Representative programme
Monday 1st September: the beginning of the race, the first training
Tuesday 2 September: Train opened for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogram (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September in Czech - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of summer
Russian and sex. Fans can still support the Central American Agreement (20:15).
The representation for them also opened an air train that begins at the Summer in 18:30.
And he's gonna follow the autograph that Rosician and Czech won't miss.
Otherwise, this gathering of the national team will be more comfortable.
That's how the Vrba coach, who just ran into the amount of community action on the street.
Finally, we're going to pay what we want to pay.
Now we'll focus on the Netherlands.
It's good if you have players together for eight days.
We're going to have time to make things that haven't been so long," said the Wrba, who officially leads the national team from winter.
The Czech football representative will carry out a male picture at the entry into the new qualifying cycle.
The representative has three seats under the Wrbo, all ready.
Norske and Finnske were reimbursed 2:2 and Rakousk had lost 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's right now.
The Treaty with the Netherlands also establishes qualifications for the European Union's mission procedure 2016.
Of course, the Czech man would have helped if he had a general against the United States.
The first half was to get to know each other.
Now there are important results.
We need to think about it so we can be successful," said the Wrba.
The only player with a three-year-old nominee who has health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
He's taking the heat.
If he didn't want to get healed in the middle of the U.S. strike, the Wrba coach would call another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she was going to die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After she was diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her pregnancy thinking she was only a few years old.
In fact, it was about Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of parental disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the liver.
The characteristic organisation of the CMT UK indicated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among CMT people, because it is only very small in terms of weakness.
It is estimated that in the United Kingdom, about 23,000 people suffer from CMTs, which can occur in the engine area, such as mild weakness, non-motor legs, and broken fingers on the leg.
In those who have reached, there may also be a lack of sensitivity or pain, this condition is treatable and progressive, which means that symptoms are worsening over time.
When Rodger's thirty, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's attack (FA) - a disease that has a very bad reputation.
She believed that before she celebrated the eighth birthday, she would be put on a bicycle chair, and she would die before she was thirty.
A mother of two children, now in her mid - 50 ’ s, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same thing.
I fell down every day, and everything went on.
I've never been able to walk with other children on bicycles or on a boatboard and I've been shocked at how I walked and walked in school."
When Rodger's thirty and she was after several operations that had to release her Achilles' legs and compare her feet, she used her doctor to leave the room and look at her documentation where she found out she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I followed, and so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked for information about disability in the book and wrote to the Association FAO," he says.
When he answered me, I was in shock, I just panicked.
I thought, before he'd hit me, I'd end up on the train, and before he'd be five, I'd be dead, and I'd gradually lose all my skills.
I was totally on my own, and I was planning a funeral."
When she was seven, she realized that her ability to ride had not diminished as much as she anticipated, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, kissed her, and said: “Dear, I don’t think you have a disease, otherwise you would be on the train.
I think it's going to be a much less dangerous life."
After the completion of several genetic tests, it was found to have CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I was a happy child," she said.
The characteristic organisation of the CMT UK initiated a month of information on CMT to warn against this disease.
Sub-contractors in the Washington region: taxes are taxed by the conversion of the economy
The growing economy represents more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And even higher taxes.
According to a new study published last week, the state and local sales to the company in the country, with the acceleration of economic health, increased peacefully last year, and the firms in Washington were not excluded.
The participants in Maryland and Virginia totaled $27.6 billion for the fiscal year 2013 to the state and local stocks, which is 3.8% higher than the $26,6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burdens - both national and local - were estimated at $4.3% per 671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and amounted to a third growth year after 2009 and 2010 when tax was reduced.
According to the study carried out by Ernst & Young, the Centre on State Taxation, the national tax increased faster by 4.3 % than the local authorities, by 3.9 %.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56%, are of the economic tax and 36% of the income of Maryland is of the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, represents at least the tax revenues of the undertaking.
According to the researchers, the majority of the increase in tax revenues is due to an increase in the value of the property of the companies concerned, which increased by 3,7 % in the three years to come.
Although most profits come from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini paid over $10 billion in state and local property data, representing an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of property is not so high as the State and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than five companies.
For the companies in Virginia and D.C., the tax is about half of the state and local tax.
"In Maryland the company owns a lot of property, especially the tax base around D.C., the government or non-profit organization that does not pay taxes," Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the Center on State Taxation, explained.
So Maryland is forced to spend more and more on taxes on incomes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in the tax revenues from the undertaking cannot be attributed only to the improvement of the real estate market.
According to the data, revenue from the undertaking appears to be rising as well.
The companies in this region have published a tax of $2.3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has selected one billion dollars, mostly in the region, on taxes received from commercial companies.
Despite the same trend, the local tax burden on businesses does not increase in these three places at the same time.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3 %, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9 %.
Only in Virginia was an increase in taxation by 4.1 %.
Virginia has at least 6 % of the total revenue received from all three companies (of which all have the same taxation).
The market share rate in Maryland is 8.25 %, while the average D.C. remains relatively high, to 9,975 %.
A similar study carried out this year by the US Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a much lower tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. studied indistinct.
And over this benefit, Virginia is under pressure to compete with the South.
North Carolina recently signed the law reducing the trade tax from 6.9% to 6%, just like Virginia, and the next year the tax is reduced to 5%.
In order to continue to meet the revenue targets in the coming year, the rate of revenue tax could be reduced by 3 % by the law in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are better able to pay higher national and local taxes.
The life tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax - the structure of compensation for higher prices, according to which the majority of companies - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia grew by 20% over the last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than any other tax.
Researchers claim that the trend and the overall increase in biofuels are likely to continue next year, the total tax revenues from sales to state and local governments will increase by 6.2 % over the same period during the first three quarter of 2014.
Washington, however, may remain behind the others because lowering State expenditure will choose its tax on the labour market.
What's left of you: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putinovo Novorusko and Lafato's bones
Is there a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for a meeting on Novoruska.
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state on the southeastern part of Ukraine, where government units have been deeply affected by the Russian rebellion.
He also warned European companies that, after the current regime of anti-virus sanctions, it would be difficult to return to the Russian market.
Support provided by the West for the war of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine is based on democratic values.
The end of the conflict according to him depends on Kyev, and it cannot be said when the Ukrainian crisis ends.
Other sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic refused to accept the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with the diplomats, has proposed a form of further approval of anti-terrorist sanctions, decided on the EU's summary tonight.
This was said by the Permanent President of the Meeting of the Member States of Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotky, specific proposals for the presumption of sanctions are already prepared in the afternoon.
Tusk will be the new EU President.
Van Rompuye is rewarded in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at the European Union summit at the head of the European Council, and so called by the Union President, who conducts the summits of the Member States.
From a quarter to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuye will be rewarded.
At the head of the European diploma, Catherine Ashton, the Italian Foreign Minister, Federica Mogherini, is represented.
Italy, which will thus become the Vice-President of the European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
The assisted death is real in Czech, but it's not talking about it
Help for chronic and long-term patients with a life-threatening absence?
In Czech terms, where laws do not allow euthanasia, it is illegal.
In addition to the expressions of doctors who have been told by the LN, it appears that they are listening to such requests.

There's a copy of the CIA, they needed a war, writes Huml about the launch of the MH17.
The Ambassador for ČSSD Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is obvious that "the hard sanctions which have been declared with regard to the shooting of a civilian aircraft with about 300 dead have been deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army".
According to the law, it's also known as the CIA's manual.
Unfulfillable promises.
The nearest elections and the parties are re-supply and impossible
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and shop over Prague.
Before each election, this is reflected: the parties make promises impossible.
Also now, with the coming municipal elections, politicians are being asked who is more interested in voters.

Family Joan Rivers: "Keep your hands"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has expressed today that the unspoiled hope of a eleven-year-old comedy will heal.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her hands.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after her cell phone to the rescue service, according to which she came to the heart station at the Yorküllen Endoscopy in Upper East Side, as the source was introduced.
Doctors carefully keep it under the influence of sedatives and careful supervision until they are certain of its status, which remains “relevant”.
The reactions to themselves have long gone to wait, including ineffective online support from such personalities as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Realita is overwritten title
That the media exceed the reality by their titles, there's no news.
I know the headlines "producing" the news, but unfortunately, I also know that there are many so-called "readers", which are nothing else.
And that's the fact that last time I've been really hard on myself, it's a lot harder to say the word of punishment.
This is particularly true of the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
It's all normal, "Israel's against Gaza."
First of all, the text says that the Israeli "fact" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, and that is often due to the time declared.
This will then appear the title "The two sides have been wrong."
Does the journalist realize that this process is directly involved in anti-Semitic events that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
It didn't last forty years since the end of World War II.
There are people who have survived Shaw.
When I saw the video from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the tax pronounced the word "Jewish swine" and similar credibility, I was shocked.
Is that what the world wants to end what hasn't happened to Hitler?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews were appointed to liquidating the Slovenians?
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You're often marked for "watching the dogs of democracy."
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its citizens.
How would you like our government to behave if some of our neighbors decided that the Czech people are breaking up and that the Czech Republic is breaking out of the map of the world?
Maybe you should know another fact, too.
Nearly 20% of Arabs live in the territory of the State of Israel with the Israeli population.
And they're good there.
If you ask them why they don't go between "theirs", they should go to Gaza, they'll answer you why they would?
In Israel, they have work, social security and spicy health care (I have seen in my own eyes how in the Spanish private hospital Hadassa, which is financed from the Jewish sponsors from around the world, often goes to Arabs and are carefully cured there).
Hamas is also attacking his Arab brothers with his guns.
The only real help for Gaza is to rescue Hamas and rescue him.
And let not Israel put away his words.
Tell us about Hamas' practices, his abuse of humans as human victims.
Please report that Hamas is intended to corrupt the state of Israel, and that is for any price.
And for the price of the death of innocent Arab children.
Please report that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please report that within nine years of the independence of the Gaza Strip, this region could be a source of refreshing humanitarian assistance from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which provides water and electricity to which all gas managers are not paying, and even it is clear that supplies are currently under way.
If Hamas hadn't invested money in the underground tunnels construction so that they could be hired by suicide fighters on the territory of Israel, it would have been better for him to build houses, hospitals and schools, and live with his Arab brothers in Gaza.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion on Twitter
AMAZON just confirmed the claim Information from Monday morning: Internet retailer - producer of videos and hundreds of other things - buys $1.04 billion ($990 million) video streaming service on Twitter.
The announcements did not surprise anyone because no one would expect Twitter to buy someone, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Googlu seemed to be one billion sure, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which first founded Justin.tv three years ago, had been designed to become a popular video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who have posted online transfers from her – the words Business Insider “YouTube for Life Transmitted Games”.
Twitche interface.
On YouTube are already popular videos “Let's play”, the kind where smart (most older) play the Mystery Science Theatre.
The fact is that YouTube comes across a lot, so the news that YouTube buysTwitch, no one's got a lot of trouble, was a student example of how the company is paying possible competition.
They wonder why the YouTube agreement failed, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the statement by CEO Twitche Emmeta Sheara: "We have chosen Amazon because he believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster."
The next adventure is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitter.
For substances like me, who claim that sports are doing better than they are watching, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about playing instead of playing real.
One thing is to look over the shoulder in the three mornings of a friend, how the Resident Evil plays, and the other thing is to watch someone else get 20 points to his head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular heroes are from the players' perspectives, so looking at their records, without you being able to control their own perspective, is quite a good recipe, how to sort out a cigarette.
I agree that the game type of speed run in which Roger Bannisters finish our electronic time game in record time is fun.
But if someone isn't the master of play or humor, his channel on Twitter will probably not be very interesting.
But what does that sceptic know about me?
Twitch has 55 million visits per month and is fourth to the top of Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon use it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitter will switch to Amazon Instant Video just as elegant as it could be to use YouTube.
But Twitch has something she would like to attract every company: the mountains of young men who want to impress.
As President Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said "believes in her future" and the media don't seem to look like it's a little bit of a joke.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American Atheistic Logger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
Copy the original video.
Another fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers discuss one of the many things they disagree with their religion, they often ask us the question: Who will you believe?
God's word, or man's word?
It would be as if human research were completely useless compared to the authority they claim to have.
Only when they say "man", they talk about science.
And when they refer to the word of God, they refer to the myth of God written by men.
If there is really an intelligent Creator with a purpose, then it is the one who created a fossil record that reflects evolutionary history, and it must be the one who designed the genetic pattern that meets it, and it must be the one who added further lines of evidence that points exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion of the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, fabulating.
And these were the people who wrote all these texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every particular sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as a man-made, not a god.
People who were "simply" or "inspired" by their beloved gods, or should have listened to the dictatorship of angels, but these texts were not signed by any other than the only mortals with a certain degree of imagination, no angels and no gods at all.
If there really was a real god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, over-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole universe.
If the existence of such a size ever wrote the book, there would be only one such book, one sacred letter.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without precedents, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure with such a task.
And people wouldn't believe it, because it would be consistent, based on verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal deep silence and wisdom far beyond all human boundaries.
She would keep inspiring every reader to the common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything less.
Only what we see instead of it is the exact opposite.
Instead of the only religion that leads to the final truth, we have many different religions without a common source and all continue to differ in what further divisions of denominations, seeking the truth of the truth, and in every way distorting divine direction, regardless of continuing divorce and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Koran, the Baha'u'llah'v Kitáb-i-Akkadás, the Zarathustrovy Avesty, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharátska Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book Urantia are all considered to be "a absolute truth" and "a revelation of the only true God" and the related believers each claim that these others are on their way.
The only logical explanation is that they are on the road to a certain extent.
None of the above-mentioned books shall benefit from any other advantage.
None of them have any evidence to support and no historical confirmation.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I'm not saying that I have proved the Bible to be boring and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith as well as apologies (debts) because they contain incompatibility, absurdity and primitive ideas sometimes considered to be true which have already been convinced.
So they can't claim to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them claim that they have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy, with the fact that each can also contain a prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
Early theologians agree that all sacred texts were written by human hands and are thus subject to interpretations, ideas, and views of their primitive and often associated political motivations, which explain many of the contradictions and differences in these books, especially those found in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, rather a mutual comment.
We need to show again that we have two different authors here whose work was kind of mixed together during some editoral audit.
It's true that Genesis has more than one author, and it's definitely not a clear witness!
Some experts now disseminating four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. five books of the “Moses ” and Moses do not assign authority to any of them, since they were almost not as described in the Bible.
The panel members agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of a number of unexplained oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were refiltered at the same time and all were signed by human authors.
The Bible is not as old as her religious beliefs.
Witnesses from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological finds known for their incomplete basis of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are much younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Diedian cults, Chinese or Egyptian worship.
Christianity began to be a Gnostic faith, followed by doctrine and ecumenism and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were scattered and disinclined with other Bible versions.
One of these administrations refers to the King of Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Law decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord on Mount" changed to Belzebuba "Lord Muhr".
So the Bible was deliberately and twice changed for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Law was canonized in the 4th century B.C.E. in the series of Commission decisions on snow in Nicaragua.
The four gospels were accepted and the sixty others were rejected by the simple lifting of hands, as if the reality were given to accept or abstain from voting.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read about non - Christians in those Christian centers.
What happened on the second week after the temple in Jerusalem?
What about the Roman church at the same time?
And they gradually found that they were close to the same Gospel accounts.
And that's how the central canon developed from the roots of the original church.
So the end has just accepted as a gospel any relevant stories that have clung between uneducated masses at that time.
However, they carefully collected more than ten books of the Bible, even though they referred to them as approved books.
Among the rejected statements, we will find records of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s word refer to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be accepted if God was the real author of this complicated mechanism of history, imagination, and sorrow?
The Bible was certainly written by people and was definitely not too clear, more so!
That's why it's so much of its historical and scientific content all over the wrong, whatever it's all about from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believe that the goats and the goats can speak, believe in the curses, the blood sacrifices, the rituals, the miraculous objects, fire cures, astrology, and five lives of magic.
They thought that if they use a concussion tube that causes blood to be shed, they would treat it from the lips.
We're talking about people who thought that the queens were overcrowded and non-smokers were birds and whales were fish and drinking the whole number.
These people believed that when they show pregnant cows, they give birth to a threatened calf.
How could someone say this to someone who knows something about genetics?
The authors of this book didn't know that.
If the Bible had been written into some higher form of existence, it would not have included the mistakes it contains.
If she came out of the cave and was thought to be a historical story, then she wouldn't even have anything to do with what she's saying.
As a moral leader, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and greedy spirits who viewed or supported cruelty against animals, insects, children, child abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, child abuse, rape, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
In order to justify their neutrality by claiming that they do God’s will.
But creatives still ignore all of this.
Some of their Web sites suggest that if there is any truth in conflict with the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creatives didn't have their favorite books, they wouldn't even have God.
There's one and the other in their world.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "instinct creation instead of Creator".
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and the god of itself, and they even insist that the rendering of their supposedly "holy" books of some sort of deviators of God as such.
No version of their gods, but all versions of God.
Creatious Christians think that if the Bible is correct, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and that the Bible could be misleading at the same time, for it cannot distinguish doctrine from God.
So it is a kind of prayer, where believers teach man’s complexion, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are Jehovah’s Word.
Only God has never written or pronounced any of the letters of any religion.

A runner in a Chinese school beat nine people, three of whom died
A man named Čchen, according to the agency New China, entered the building of basic schools in the morning and surrounded about half of the same local time.
Three of the nine people he beat later died in the hospital.
The Czechs later took a leap from the heights, introduced New China with a reference to the regional government.
In recent years China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where there are many married couples in accordance with government policy only one generation.
The land of first-persons in Lánech showed how to sit in school
At least nine schools were held in their classrooms, where you and your teacher were waiting for the president's arrival.
Then he told the kids how he had to sit in school on his own.
"We had to sit with our hands behind the back, it's not gonna make you happy anymore, you're free people," said the children of Zeman.
His wife then handed the firstborn over as a gift to his head.
President Miloš Zeman is in charge of the first basic school in Länech.
The Minister of School Marcel Chladek started a new school year in private sports school in Lithuania.
"This year I want to offer more Czech school with Czech sport," said one of the reasons why the first school day went north of Czech.
In time, he was promoted to the hockey race in Lithuania.
"It was the first time, so I accepted an invitation to attend the beginning of the school year," the minister added.
Marcel Chládek (CHSSD) began a school year in a private sports school in Lithuania.
In the first class of the year, 115 thousand firstborn.

Apple iCloud posted hackers, publicly obtained our photos of celebrit
Screenshot with unique files
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes notes and pornographic pictures of American Celebrates, warning of this American server Mashable.com.
It has reportedly obtained incorrect access to user accounts on the Applu servers, where access to users has been played through automatic storage of photos from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't been exposed to the problem yet.
Some celebrites reject images as faked, but several of the rights of the images have already been recognised.
Patriots among them and heretic Jennifer Lawrence is known for the title role of Katniss in the Hungarian Film Series or Mary Elizabeth Winsted, who played, for example, in the Death Post 4.0.
The aim of hacker is to use the photos and videos obtained for cooking.
In fact, the arrests have shown an interest in American journals, according to a report on the 4chan server, but hacker wants more money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it is very likely that it is a weakness in iCloud security.
On the GitHub server, the same tool appeared two days ago, which enabled access to user accounts through gross strength, and automatic feedback of attempts to sign up with different passwords.
This tool was apparently working, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is true that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before the publication of this tool.
The iCloud users should therefore change their password for preventive reasons associated with Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The unique image of the celebrit is considered to be a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although companies such as Apple, Google, or Microsoft, are more secure than computers in households or smaller companies, the load of sensitive photos in the unsaved form is a risk.
If you want to store an explicit photo or any other sensitive content on-line, first encrypt files before upload.
It is also wise to set up automatic photo storage on the phone so that it can pass only on Wi-Fi and after connecting to the supplier.
Then you will have the opportunity to move "to safety" during sensitive images, and in particular you will have a space to remove the unused images, so they will not be able to capture the space in the online setting.
Tips on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer HN readers and IHNED.cz in the form of electronic books from Michala Altaira Valáška in PDF format.
A smart way to save for high school script
In view of the fact that the price for high school script for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, the incoming student of the second year came in a smart way to reduce costs.
He designed a book-keeping system from senior-year-olds offering nominal compensation to support their return.
"The book on bills, which usually amount to $180, I got ten and a half in a semester," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at the Convention College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would be $430, he says.
Exhaust 120.
According to the University Council, an average student will lose more than $1,200 a year, but students have different opportunities to manage these expenses.
Preferably, students are becoming online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
At the outset, it is a school rent that enables students to use the book semester, often with an excellent discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 bookshops in the area camps, says the book rental has doubled since 2011.
A study in the department shows that around a quarter of books in university libraries were hired in the last quarter of the season, says Vice-President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the educational texts are purchased by the National Association of University Trades in University Bookshops.
There's 101 best ways to be successful here.
Buying online
The prices of some new books can be on the Internet up to a third less than in the university library.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Rona Larson, Bruce Edwards and Roberta Hostetler is about $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new $239.99 in a retail shop specializing in a school store.
Buy Used
If you are not aware of other people's or of the needs and needs of others, the appropriate possibilities are used for learning.
At Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a high-ranking student at Brigham Young University, says that he paid at Amazon.com for the use of the “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business” 42 cents.
The new guy was selling for $48.
University student Ingrid Bracey, leading University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students in their students check whether older education is acceptable.
Sometimes no change for work in seminars is essential.
If so, the older ones can be sold at the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a favorite option for buying used books as well as eBay Inc's Half.com.
Retirement
There are also loans for students, if you behave well with them, you do not forget to return them and you do not need them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the costs for the new book.
For example, a student would be able to borrow "Calculus" for about $2.
List the terms and conditions of the trade in which you hire a book, including markings, excretion or consumption and injury.
Remember: If you do not return the book in time, the search can be higher than the price of a new book.
E-mail
Other options are to take care of instead of the normal e-book.
Sometimes these books are mainly paid in the form of electronic license paid after a certain period of time by distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg pays "Calculus" for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most affordable offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go after the shops.
Joe Gaul, 29, who is soon attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends running according to the ISBN, because it commands you to buy the right book.
Before you order a book via the Internet, you'll make sure it's really a stock, Gault.
He was convinced of that on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay a full price for a book from the university library.
Bahno, just bahno.
And then they found in a heavy stream of guns at the end of the war.
These students are standing out of St. Jiří's church.
We discovered a hole around and we started to pull off the flying nose - a hole of a meter and a half of a bahna and a sealed list.
When we got close to the Christmas day, we got hit on the head," said Radomil Novak.
We took her out, cleaned her up and found out that it was a tricky German rifle used by SS units.
Nealez's a little unusual.
According to my information, such guns were made until the end of the war.
And they were about three thousand," Novák added.
All the wooden construction stuff was broken down in time, so it's useless.
Her body is still preserved - it keeps its shape.
How's the cold eye?
There's an explanation.
Maybe the people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units were probably afraid not to be removed.
Fascists on the run wouldn't have done it.
You asked the guns in the woods," they think they'll find.
The gun was the only thing the ghosts found in the studio.
"There may have been some hand grenades, these were sometimes around the corner, so we lost our shopping jobs, so we've completely lost our sense of humor so that there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," approached Novák.
Nalez ends up in the museum's depositary at the castle in the nearby Slysian Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I haven't released the Czechs yet
The exclusive conversation Actually.cz with General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the Russian separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... call me from Donécka," he apologized about about eight times during an exclusive conversation with Actual.cz Ukrainian General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the director of the Foreign Centre for the Liberation of Military Entrepreneurs.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
At every such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - that Ruban would agree with his client at the second end of the phone.
"It's going to be--go over there," concluded one of the white discussions with Doneck, and he confessed to ours again.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the warehouse, some pilots and active participants of anti-government protests in Madanu.
Another night - when we had a conversation - he was in Dong.
The release of Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the Prussian separatists shall be four and a half hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that the Russian separatists are also fighting.
Our counter-scientific estimates their number to the third.
They can be more and more.
Have you met with a Czech prisoner at your meetings?
Volodymyr Ruban: I've already released the promised Serbs, the Dagestans, the Chechens, one Swedishs, the Georgians... but Czechs still don't.
But I know who to turn to in Prague, if we were to attack on your promised land and could free it.
Ukrainian army occupied by separatists
A.cz: What do you do to Czechs who join the Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers are busy?
They should understand that if, like Czechs, they fight in the ranks of volunteers in Ukraine and separatists take them, they will be shot without mercy, just like any other race.
The separatists consider these men to be rent debtors, and you think they deserve nothing more than death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take part in a group of Dutch separatists - and between them they need Czechs - then they put him on the grid and join him as a military prisoner.
This guy's a short life.
The Ukrainian side is also acting in war as a state.
A.cz: And how many of you have been able to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand it well, they'll change it.
Some sources suggest that it's been over hundreds of men for a long time.
We've been counting on people for a long time.
But we only released them... they didn't save before the war if they decided to continue in fear.
The rescuers are in the war of doctors, surgeons, but we definitely don't.
That's right.
And every day they get more and more.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, four or five.
And you don't always have to talk about the exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release the prisoners and just a human request.
A.cz: It turns out that in a few months, you've got a great authority and even trust in the Russian separatists... as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both sides of the war?
A serious question.
One of the officers in Kyiv gave me a vision of "a crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe it's the foundation of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Court of Justice, I've already received some authority from this authority.
I never miss, I don't give up, and I always keep the word.
Whatever happens, I do the right thing, and I speak the truth.
Even when it is the Ukrainian government, or the Dutch or Luhansk very unpleasant.
If he's suffering and killing people?
So I'm just telling them they're suffering and killing her.
And they're criminals.
I'm often at risk of life, even when I'm being replaced by employers and involved... this job can always mean the end... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many corrections and tortures do you know?
... (long silence...) To torture the prisoners at hearings, Ukrainians and separatist.
I'm sorry.
What about the repairs?
They're just playing on the doll side.
I don't have any information about the fact that the Ukrainian army also corrects the employee.
Not even the signs of the Ukrainian army being allowed something like that.
We have a picture of the number of corrections, but I can't put numbers on and I don't want to.
A.cz: Write to me the characters and motives of the prorus separatists.
They're officers among them, but they're also veterans from Afghanistan.
It's about independence and perhaps democracy in Doneck and Luhansk - at least that's what they say.
They don't want to play any more games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their incorrigibly opposed to life and death.
As we're saying, they're eaten up to their throats.
The same dreams and accusations of the people were passed outside the village and on Majdan.
And now I'm a little suspicious: Russia supports the separatists and the West instead of the Ukrainian state.
One speculative is considering the big one and the other is the small one.
This world of mine, but it's hidden in it is an incalculable divorce.
A.cz: How does one of the strongest leaders of the Russian separatists Igor Bezler, for example?
Every time I cross the line of war fronts, I'm without weapons and I'm showing soldiers or armed men who have broken their hands.
And I always have both sides of these two walls or three meters on the man or on the optical target.
Those faces of people who measure up to me, I see every good thing... and they can always shake their arms.
Exhibitor, experienced Colonel with German and Ukrainian predecessors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine shouldn't exist.
And if so, just like a small government in a large Russian empire.
In any case, she continues to talk about it and Ukraine considers it to be a major misunderstanding.
Such a state shouldn't even exist under him.
At the same time, he is an unwarranted enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we're talking about the characters - in a discussion show of Ukrainian television, you marked your Prime Minister Arsenie Jaceňuka as a weak, infamous and desperate "leader", who would do the best if he left quickly.
For those three feet of horses, I'll always get at least five times as scared.
Why, then, should I keep in mind that Jacenuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is damaging our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians of Jacenuka are a "king".
And the queen is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal from which he would be afraid or in the other respect and authority.
His behavior directly copies the queen's behavior.
Maybe it's a good economy, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, ask him to play with him his intrites, threaten that his position is a function... he has to run the country, repair it and in time of war and protect it.
When the country is threatened, there is no prime minister for family, friends, rest on the emotional burden.
He's the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
What about your jacket?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's still in trouble.
That's why he should leave.
As before, it's better for Ukraine.
Why Galaxies Guards Failed to Save the Markets
The three Sylvester Stallonees returned from the U.S. ninety-nine million budget to less than 30 million dollars and Sin City: Women, for which I would have killed only 12 million dollars.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million during the first week, as well as films for children such as how to raise the baby 2 was for a fallout.
According to an article of Robbie Collina’s film criticism on Telegraph, children’s films are about their own quality.
Collin marked the year 2014 as the "lower" year of child films and how to develop Dr. 2 called the only "functional" follow-up.
When it comes to films based on a little older target group, the problem does not necessarily need to be in the quality of the film itself.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average evaluation of the annual film premiums issued at least 2,000 Chinese in the period between the Day of the War Victims and the 20th July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of viewers and film critics indicate that the annual film level is similar to the low speed.
According to some commentators, wines can be changed into wines and higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's work on the books of the jungle, told Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think time changes."
We have to let this happen and don't try to get away with what's already happened.
In contrast to the current Hollywood cash market crisis, Netflixu gained $1.2 billion through Internet services, which is nearly twice as much as London's $837 million.
In the past year, director Steven Spielberg has criticised the study because they rely too much on the rights of the comics, and has warned Hollywood to "break up."
In the light of the current decline, some commentators declare that there may be something on his catastrophic scale.
With the introduction of possible large cash markets in 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimón and Joursk world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
Manufacturer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked down in markets for a simple "cyclic". Pro Hollywood Reporter said: "The next year will be the year of the biggest cash markets in history and no one will care about sales."
KLDR again threatened Soulu, fired another short-term rocket
North Korea set off another short flight rocket to the sea, announced Soul.
A random rocket test was performed shortly after the completion of the Joint Military Managers of the United States and South Korea, which Pchjungjang is considered to be an invasion preparation.
The province of Čagang lies in the northwestern part of KDLR at the border with China.
According to the DPA, the South Korean Ministry of Defence indicated that the shootings were fired from the northwestern KLDR and flew 200 miles [200 km] away.
North Korea was apparently the first to fire a rocket from the province of Čagang, bringing the South Korean media with a call to the army circle.
In the province, there is a sub-terranean detonation ram for the rocket type Scud.
It's another of the series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has carried out a very unusual number of rocket tests and shells this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, NATO summit protests were held in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at the centre of Newport to take part in the attack against NATO.
And on Sunday about 150 people came to Cardiff's workshop for a meeting that was described as anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough observed the situation during the weekend and spoke to the protesters who had arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Tenagers had to be aired with Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by the airport and transported to safety after spending the night in Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen-year-old girl and eight-year-old man went out on a tour to Govets Leap in Blackjack on Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't come home, the alarmers called the police for about eight hours at night.
She was sent to a police station and a rescue team, and a couple were found about one hour late in the evening near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl was in the corner, and the man fell down, and then he fell to his head.
The police stayed with them during the night, and they were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized condition, they were transferred to the Blue Mountain Hospital.
Olomouc brought from Opawy only point, the prize was on your feet
The 23-year-old forvard could decide, but he failed in two greatest chances.
After the ball, she shot almost three minutes before the end, but she ended up at the Opawy of Joseph Quetton's branch.
I had it on my feet, so I have to give it a chance.
"I'm mad at myself," your symphony drank on his head.
"If I had to give it up under the floor, I'd have a little bit of a seat," he said.
The defense Sigmy didn't allow it very much, except for Mikul's 11-minute train, which, however, covered the gold of Reichl.
Then they started to press Hanaci, but they didn't let the protective home block in and shot out of the way.
Fifteen minutes we compared, and then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the games and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the chance that your chance has not changed, and that's how it ended at 0:0," said coach Hanák Leoš Kalvod.
The story is also about the absence of a group where, besides two injured persons, Peter Vavřík with the three-year-old Petre Ševčík shooter who are staying in Slezk from Sigmy.
This did not make them independent of their previous policies.
The supervisors deserve absolute authority.
Sigma made a photoball game, but we didn't let her do anything to one standard," said Coach Slezanós Petr Baranek.
There was a lot of dignity, aggression and war.
Remiza is probably deserved, the point is a good gain for us," he added.
Sigma reached the limit at four points, which means the third place.
Nothing that could calm the head of the Joseph Lébra club, which, after the accident with Znojm, has put its million-dollar income into the relatively different performances in other stocks.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébra's warning, so it can't be about the boys don't want to fight," said Kalvoda, and to the address of the shooter your daughter added, "I believe it's coming, and when he gives his head, it's going to fall there.
But after the first trick, I'll shoot him right away to shoot his balls on another game," Kalvoda said.
Al Pacino twice beat Benátky.
The Film Festival otherwise survives the crisis
After a huge surprise over the impressive video by Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Ijárrit once enrolled among serious candidates at the Golden Lava, the following days testified that he was interested in the 71st anniversary festival in Benátka.
Whether it's because the number of places in the largest hall has increased to fourteen, or because, after Birdman's, the criticisms have been followed, but for the wilder pictures as a document on genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, looking at silence and other movies with a social theme from 99 homes after the Iranian Union, there was a short stay in Chinese.
Crews of comedians
Even the red cupboard before the festival palace has not yet been covered by such taxes as in the past, and it is likely that it will be difficult to sit at the hotel's last minute.
The crisis in Italy speaks more about the crisis than it is and is not surprising that it has reached such respected institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Unfortunately, the crisis does not show a lack of personality, however, especially in connection with the film.
While the younger fans went through the autographs of the chemical superheroes Michael Shannona and Andrew Garfield, who successfully raised dramatic roles in 99 homes throughout the country, the main event of the visit of the legendary priest Ala Pacina was without distinction for all generations.
He's got two more shots in here right now.
In the story of Revelation, the competition that confronted Oscar Barry Levison according to the novel Philip Rotha, has a 14-year-old Pacino role that is closer to him: a priest at the top of glory, who suffers from depression at the end of career and personal life.
But to see him the second day as a sub-developed railway owner from a foreign town in the Manglehorn film surrounding David Gordon Green was a truly memorable experience.
Volpi's prize for the best heeric performance should not be forgotten - but does the artist still need the price of Pacin's format?
It may be the most satisfying love of the public for him, and especially for the Italian, because while he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his ancestors come.
Body for Italy
Last year the Italian film is very good in Benátka.
The black soul that ruled Francesco Munzi became behind Birdman's first photograph of a long-recorded statue.
The calabrian version of mafie is taken into account by looking at the family relationship between the clans who fight each other for power and money, and the director has been able to follow all the assumptions for good film: a quality scenario, a camera, music and herce.
He was also involved in a poor psychothriller Hlado's heart that surrounded Severio Costanzo and Albo Rohwacher in the role of a woman who lost her own child in a tragic accident.
On the contrary, both of the French competing films did not expect the warm reception of the famous or 3 hearts, both of which are based on the traditional model of consumer films, which are described as the popularity of heretic representatives.
But in the end, two really real films, then Birdman and Black souls, aren't at the first half of the festival so small.
And perhaps the festival paintings have all the depressive objects, a new picture of Peter Bogdanovich called She's Funny That Way, an attractive comedy mentioned in the Benaths except the competition and set up in the style of American cheerleaders in the 40s, have been able to call for more than one day.
Police arrested four pervitin manufacturers in Prague, drugs taken from Poland
"In recent days, three men 42, 42 and 37 years of age and a five-year-old woman who made and sold pervitin drugs from late November to August of the year," said police spokesman Jan Rössler.
First on Tuesday, 12 August, a storage unit in the Cihlářska street was arrested by a 12-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was listed in the group as a buyer of medicines in Poland and a sales dose.
The following day the detectives were detained on the basis of the previous agreement by the State representative of another member of the group, a seven-year-old man.
The last of the four police officers arrived in the middle of the early 20th of August in the area of the Malishic Fuel," the speaker wrote.
A woman received a third of the drugs for transporting medicines from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of skills.
In a part of the flight area, in a garden house in Horomérící, in the Connivo street and in other places at Prague 9, he made pervitin, provided various reliefs and chemicals needed for his production and ensured the transfer of pseudofedin medicine from the Republic of Poland.
He continued to take drugs, distribute them into plastic bags, and then sell pervitin.
With the transfer of medicines from Poland or the sale of drugs, he was helped by a five-year-old woman who was not depressed.
For this she received a reward from the organizer of a third of the drugs produced," Rössler added.
Criminals have also carried out a number of domestic inspections on the basis of the order of the judge, where they have provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, plates, injection syringes, haediacs and other aids and items which, according to the expert, can be considered as complete preparation for methamphetamine.
Dealer has been tortured seven times since 1995
"Then the police found out from the available evidence that the main organizer had been sentenced to seven times as a result of his own criminal activity since 1995, the woman was not sentenced to trial," the police speaker added.
In 2006, the last prisoner was sentenced to sexual abuse and a seven-year-old auto mechanic who was released was sentenced to nine times in 2009.
And it was too much for his own criminal activity.
The investigator accused three men and women of surviving a criminal offence of unauthorized production and other supply with opium and psychotropic substances and of what would threaten them until ten years of imprisonment.
Finally, three persons were asked to investigate the State representative and to submit a proposal to the ruling hearing at which the judge finally decided," the speaker said.
The fourth accused, a seven-year-old relapser, ended up free.
His position and role in this case were not as fundamental as that of the other accused.
Police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers wood and carbon chips.
Ferrari offers very interesting things in the context of its other products for a lot of "interested" prices.
As a good example, you need to use hand-made chess in Italy with playing board size 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 Kč.
The actual price is 43 405 Kč.
The customer will get the fruit of the black and red liquefied figurines placed in a wooden box covered by carbon fibers.
It's probably not surprising to anyone that instead of a classic runner, they have players available a figure of moving horses.
If you don't think of the chess as a sufficiently valuable gift, the Ferrari 500 F2 model should also be made (of course manually) at 1:1,8.
The price of this game makes 318 305 Kč.
The destruction of gymnasiums and high school doesn't make sense.
The Czechs have a little generally educated people and statistics also show that gymnasiums have good practice.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In schools in the last four days, great preparations were made.
Most of these are routine concerns, such as the transfer of flowers from the summer station back to the class and the drawings.
They're going to have a little bit bigger fruit on the hot springs.
A few days before the start of the season, they collect supplies, computers and other technical equipment and literature into the library.
The four-year gymnasium in Horíčia has not come to the loupés and is opening and renewing its activity after three years.
Not on public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of the depositors to do so.
They had to wait to see if the existing schools would be confirmed by being transferred to the MSMT school register.
"The French Socialists should hide and give France an order," said the key link to Francoise Holland
Valls calls for a strongly broken left to "show his support" to the Socialist President, whose new division did not meet with the agreement of most of the French.
The President deserves public respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay on his side," he said, hiding a sigh.
As a modest gesture, the president of the government has maintained that his government will not fail the controversial French tripartite working week, despite the generous contributions made by Emmanuel Macrona, a new finance minister who at the beginning of the week proposed that the rules be released.
On Saturday, the Netherlands asked socialists to remain "sustainable" with the government.
Christiane Taubirov, a minister of justice, made a point of starting off when he appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where the Socialist side criticized her for "Frankose lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Penov, a leader of extremely conservative rights, laughed at persistent internal disputes between socialists when she announced that she did not assume that the new Valls' government would last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is a liar and Prince Manuel Valls too. They were forced to establish a new government when this past did not last until the end of the year.
"And the new will not remain until the end of the rain or the winter," said Le Penja to his guests.
She reiterated her call for Parliament's resolution and said she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
France's ruling party suffered in the coastal municipal elections and in May the very conservative law succeeded in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a study of the public edition of the Journal du Dimanche, 76 per cent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk that it will be divided into several rival factions even before the end of the functional period of Holland in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, Politologist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that French people will soon be able to endure if the new socialist government is unable to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that changes are happening in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Hazard and street art no longer limits Praha's choice
The amendments to the relevant statements should be prepared and approved until new management of the capital.
The streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal elections, and the city will not be limited to street art.
It's not even a dog's wedding.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve the amendments to the relevant statements by its representatives.
"The decision on the change should also not make the current management of the city that ends within a few weeks," said Councilmanhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, a number of workers, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to break down a lot of gambling in their territory.
But Herny doesn't get tired, the gambling announcement will not change yet.
It's a job to take a new city after the call.
Now we wouldn't even technically take that into account, for example, for the length of the reminder and the same," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representative to be approved by the amendment of the statement shall be effected on 11 September.
The referendum on the general ban on gambling is held on the day of municipal elections of the city parts Praha 1 and Praha 8.
At the present time, you will be required to pay for gambling, for example in Price 2 or Price 12.
For the same reasons, the report will not be changed even in the case of street art, so-called busing.
In particular, Praha 1, who has already sent the Magistrate of a site proposal, which would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Singers also don't want Praha 5 around Angel.
The statement governing the wedding of dogs in the city lasts a few months, and it's not over yet.
The location of the hero and the problem of the busing solves the city's statements.
It can be issued or managed only by the representative of the main city.
The councils only have an advisory voice, they can't give a statement themselves.
Last week put victory for the bidders of the Scottish independence to the reach of the hand
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making this mistake when little by little she placed on the billboards throughout Scotland the question of whether Scotti wants to be rich.
You will not be able to appeal to the hearts of Scottish voters to their money, nor will you gain their respect when you start threatening them.
The Morals of New Law is still alive in Scotland, although only a few Scotts still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to get the changers out of the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The Head of Scottish Nationalists Alex Salmond knew this well, and therefore in the television discussion again asked his opponent, Unionist Darling, if he was willing to respect "the wishes of the Scottish people", if Scottish voters would vote for independence, and start to support a single mine for Scotland and for England.
It brought Darlinga to love the Scottish civil society and the London finance community, and he fell into this trap with a terrible fall.
Of course Darling doesn't support the orders of Scottish voters.
However, this debate on which Scotland will have a change has already been neutralized.
What really motivates the Scottish Volcano is fertility, employment opportunities and the protection of public health, which are free of charge.
Darling supported the London banker in exchange for the change and also called for the idea that he would not protest against privatization of health.
As Samand said, "he went to bed with the conservators."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish lawyer knows that the Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who never spoke to the voters in Scotland, but to the "boss" association, to the Confederal of the British Industry.
It becomes clear that Cameroon's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmonde was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a detached housenut.
Scotty would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least managed to say Scotland could be "a successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it causes him almost physical pain.
What he's sending is clear: Scots don't have to wait and they have to accept what they are.
The next year is 10 months.
Pessimistic beginning of school according to Milosche Urbana
Illustration for the most recent year
Dear Urban Last Year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that was never going anywhere, and we just had to go out and hang out with my grandmother in the summer, quiet before the storm, calm down before the stress.
New clothes, when they came to meet with Tuezhu, bottles from East Germany.
The reading of the Quick Ships, already fallen, hanging on the top of the Empire to the back of Vary, some to the tennis squares, there was no more wind, the sun cooled the back and the shoulder, the paps fell on the loose.
The evening of calm nervousness, still empty mode, sleeping until half a week, it'll be worse, a few minutes before I wake up in half a week, and then rise in half.
He's coming in Monday.
Most of them don't. Rather, the summer is getting worse in front of school.
Adding to the bright light on the plate and becoming like a plastic stand in a glass tray, there is this school, ZDŠ A.
She's got an old-fashioned face and a couple of new ones, the guys are getting out, the girls are getting worse.
They're funny here, they're avoiding, they're just as interesting as they're keeping their jobs wrong and they're here too fast.
And these grown-up girls, who came in and out, are laughing at something hysterically now, maybe something has changed in their lives over empty space, while I've got it all in my old age.
And again, the new prime minister, some nerves and other pleasures, why are they even here?
Because he's got to, uh, teacher of military duty.
So inside, the cold cold of the floor and the light peach deinfection, the disabled student with the mop, still lamented the same thing as the first thing that gets a key from the fingernails, where they are allowed to leave the classrooms and which are still so small.
For the bottle.
The ice cream stays in mind, now it's gone, it's pretty wide, but it's gonna be worse in a week.
It's just from this presentation, it's getting cold and it's starting to hurt your head.
The title that we're still going to learn from mathematics is the devil's game for people I don't belong to, and I'm never going to be.
Again, the three and four, the most beautiful five, hide before the test, fall into the lab, and be there and be not, exist only as a name in the classroom, and still smell stories about nice girls and beautiful buildings, about the antennas in the universe where no one disagrees, humiliates, and abuses no one.
The last year has ten months.
And it's the first day, just like years ago.
The birth of her daughter was allowed to die.
She is threatened with exceptional punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 at the public toilet at the railway station in Jihlava.
Without any other help, she was born a girl who, after hitting the doll, hid under the bench and took her to the railway driver, where she was placed in the corridors of several ten meters away from the train.
She was born on her way to school.
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the back of the bus, and I was born there.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I broke my hips to the school," she said regretfully and pointed out that she had gone to school for pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to her place, the child's body was put in a bag and carried out, the body was taken out of the bag, wrapped in a black iron bag and hid and left under the roof of her grandmother's house in Havlíčková," they complain that it was not quite clear when it came to the death of the newborn.
It could be in ten minutes, but even a couple of hours after birth, breathing when hiding a child or entering a pool, bleeding or bleeding from an untreated pumpkin.
A similar scenario came back for the next year.
A woman in the vicinity of the U.S. period from the spring to the 12th of April, when the child was found by suitable witnesses under the crook at Havlíčkobrodsk, she also had a secret family.
This time in the bathroom in the basement in the family home.
Before she checked whether she was born alive, without interrupting, and with a doll that was surrounded by the church, she put the child in a few plastic bags, including an Igelitite bag and put it in a bathroom.
Next in the afternoon, he was taken to the fishermen together with his closest partner.
She was finally killed by a friend
The father was a true friend of both children, who had no knowledge of the strengths of the partners.
And for that reason they are not before the court, only he was accused of a violation of the law on funerals.
It was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like being stressed out as a partner.
He was manipulating with the kid against my invitation.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it came to me right now as a human," she didn't hide the disappointment that a certain man had in his relationship and feared him.
During her speech, a young woman spoke fairly.
Slysy took her to the point of talking about her relationship with her parents, who left after she reached full - time service.
She didn't want to kill herself.
"He runs after me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't take a vacation because I didn't want kids, I felt like I was young.
I wanted to give him a baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do.
I can't explain it to you," the judge answered the question.
She refused, however, to go along with the thought and the intention of killing the newborn.
The second child, according to her claim, was born dead.
She didn't stop drinking alcohol even when she was pregnant.
But I've limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
And I've mixed up smoking," she said.
Although it was difficult to see her in both cases, all of her repeated questions claimed that she had a health problem that she was pregnant.
And that's what friends do.
The main proceedings will continue in the District Court in the hearings of the Court of Justice.
In the middle it could already be a judgment.
A woman is threatened with a penalty sentence of up to 18 years of imprisonment, if any, and with a fine of extraordinary.
Norwegian Cruise is close to the three-billion-dollar repurchasing Prestige Cruise
According to sources known as the whole, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest sail carrier in the world, in the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc., is about three billion dollars.
Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, corresponding to increased competition with Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (CL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).

Prodemocratic activists in Hong Kong the day following the vote are brought by the Chinese authorities
Nearly a group of loyal people to Beijing, who had a Chinese train.
The Standing Committee of the National Human Congress agreed on Sunday that only two of the three candidates would participate in the elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the nomination committee, which will probably be composed of the members of the Peking faithful.
As a result of this decision, opposition democracy is almost impossible to obtain on the electoral lists and to allow pro-democratic activists to renew promises and protect Hong Kong's financial centre for protests under the "Central occupation".
In Hong Kong, political reform is mainly due to pressure, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democracy will be extended to other cities.
After Peking published in June a detailed report of China's official law in Hong Kong, the democratic activists organized an informal referendum on elections in the special official territory, and hundreds of thousands of people entered and occupied the city square.
The press conference presented by Prime Minister Li is organised by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Association Office of Hong Kong.
During the day, several press conferences were also held by the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission of Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office for the Affairs of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
The students announced that the afternoon will be held in front of the Hong Kong government's office.
In the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kyev to start a "national sovereignty" conversation with eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists on the east side of the country and immediately to start negotiations on the "national sovereignty" of the affected areas.
His speaker Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin did not mean that the eastern regions of Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reviewed so that the Russian-speaking region would have the right to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's challenge to the Kyiv government to deal with the Prorus attacks as with the same ones, is in line with the clear strategy that led to the outbreak of the disturbances five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and grant the Ukrainian government a new declared Novorusku in fact, so that it can connect with Russia instead of the West.
In the discussion for the first state television channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern areas of Donécka and Luhansk, which ruled in March and in depth separatist post by Moscow on 18 March, the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
The Kremlin and separatist territories recently marked as "Newrusko" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the glorious days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, which say everyone believes there is a peaceful meeting, because the Ukrainian politicians began before the parliamentary elections on October 26, while the government units attacked civil society in the areas of government separatists.
"In the interest of people living in these areas, we need to start a meaningful meeting, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of state sovereignty of south-eastern Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putinov's attack on the state sovereignty was thought to be in the context of broader autonomy, which, with the leadership of Kyev, has been a few months and should reduce the concerns of Russian-speaking areas from the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov indicated that the necessary autonomy can only be granted to the eastern region by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter of crossing between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The extension of the speech Kremlin, which was to correct the "inaccurate interpretation" of the Pathin's notes, highlighted Russia's approach to resolving the rise of separatists in the east, which is different from the open siege of Crimea, where most of the two-militarized population are due to ethnic Russia.
Moscow would have much more difficulty to annotate Donéck and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million citizens are not Russians and public opinion surveys that were still under way prior to the conflict showed widespread support for the maintenance of Ukraine.
The autonomy of Russian diplomats on international forums to allow the regional government in Ukraine to determine its own trade agreements and international relations, and in particular to give Kremlu effective control over the territories that would link the Russian flag with Crimea.
The Black Sea Poles aneclected five months ago are the seat of the main Russian maritime fleet, the sea-trading land and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between the Russian Rostov and Krym are also medium down, made and sealed, which produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Peter Porošenko, during his opening statement on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, consider changes in the constitution which would give different regions more control over their finances and language status.
This view of autonomy, however, is significantly different from the view of Kreml and separatists. Moscow is accused of armed and aggressive violence.
Putinova's last challenge to make Kyev joins separatists as equals after the next attack by the rebels last week after the Russian troops and tanks from the former calm zone of the Azov Sea crossed eastern Ukraine.
The Russian separatist forces have taken control of Novoazovski so that the Ukrainian security authorities are afraid that it is designed to cover the strategic coastal territory up to Crimea.
This strengthened the vast civilian and military effort to rebuild Mariupol, a port with a metallurgy combination of 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the port of entry to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday he joined the European Union's leading representatives in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point that is not a return," Porošenko warned.
In Ukraine there are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU summit has not submitted any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an in-depth cut-off of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday to reporters in Kiev, said that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovakia after two columns of Russian vehicles and 1,000 military units arrived in the Danube area last week to support the injured separatists.
The first of the 63 declared Ukrainian soldiers who were involved in the Russian invasion in Ilovakia were replaced on Sunday by 10 Russian ex-conspirators held a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, on Sunday in Lysenko.
In the scandal with isolated photos are filled with Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disappointment over hackers who probably stole his intimate photos of his son-in-law Gabi Greece and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after having obtained a series of explicit photos by Jennifer Lawrenco on the Internet in the biggest scandal with hacked photographs of the celebrite.
Hacker claims he has 80 photos with our Hungarian Games Lawrenco stars and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Ley Michel and hero Kirsten Dunstov.
Because of the iCloud unit, personal photos of Australian heretics Teresy Palmer, Emily Brownings, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourn's heretics were also publicly available.
There's 101 celebrate on the list.
Edelsten, who asked for his hand last month, said to the magazine Confidential, "It's useless."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information is given to steal and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, reported online news reports that hacking is "unsatisfied" and those who have become his target are "depressed".
It's because hacker got thirty photos of Palmer with former friend Scott Speedman, including two photos that are on top of the pool.
Palmer's effect, for example, in the film Love and the honor of which Liam Hemsworth was her rival.
Palmer's star, the TV series Chuck Strahovski and the hero from the trailer Sucker Punch Browning's stolen photos didn't comment yesterday.
The representative of Lawrenc's TMZ said: "It's a clear violation of privacy."
Herec Seth Rogen hacker on his Twitter criticised: “To publish photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs should not be tolerated.
Fotbalist Sigmys made their way to Lebra, and without a win.
Olomouc - Chromys and bleeks, the co-founder Sigmy Joseph Lébr sat on his underprivileged last week, are, it seems, past.
To be brought from Opawy to the end, only the point for a blank limit.
The discovery and the fighting of the club boss just made a little better.
The money for the rent could come to the club soon.
"I'll leave another game as I talked about last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lebr confirmed, although Sigma didn't win, her players convinced her of a better performance.
The fight and the puzzle we played in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In such a case, I am able to forgive that he doesn't win.
If we play that since the start of the season, I'm sure we haven't played yet," Lebr thinks.
Sigma in Opave stopped the initial pressure of the domestics, then the game got better and in the second half it was better.
After the victory, Kalvod’s believers defeated, but they did not get their chances to win, and they couldn’t win.
The result of the network is not according to our idea.
To complete peace we missed but only one changed chance," Lebr declared, but he did not think that the change in the access of the footballers would only cause his excavation.
There must have been more aspects.
Whether it's from my side, from the coach, or from the fans," said Lebr.
The pressure must be calculated by Sigma
Players didn't want to comment on what happened in Opave since last week.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to allow it," young banker Michal Reichl cut his head off.
Then, completely without comment, he left a question on Lebrov's statement from last week's attacker Václav Vášček, who did not change the biggest opportunity of Sigmy in the Saturday tape.
But after that, he just talked a little bit about pressure.
We're still under pressure.
Everybody wants to get us out of here.
Today we have shown that if we fight and drive everyone after shit, that's how it goes," he said.
Warnings took them to the heart
Even Uncle Leoš Kalvoda did not point out that the preparation for the feast was not the easiest view of the atmosphere in Olomooc last week's panorama.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lebra's warning took them to the heart.
Even if it wasn't even before it was about not trying to fight and throw it away," said the wolf coach.
It was like today's first fifteen minutes.
It's been a long time before we compared ourselves to a solid, and we realized what the second link is.
That it's not just about football, but mainly about that war," said Kalvoda.
There's no hope that Sigme will be working from the beginning in the next steps.
"I'd rather believe it," he added.
