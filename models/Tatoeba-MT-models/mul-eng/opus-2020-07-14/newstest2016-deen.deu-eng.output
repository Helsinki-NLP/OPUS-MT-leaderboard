Obama received Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
They wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and on destabilising measures in the Middle East.
In the event of the encounter, however, the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-State solution discussed should also be addressed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises Israel's ongoing settlement structure and causes Netanyahu lack of will in the peace process.
The division of the Iranian nuclear programme by Obama has further damaged the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu held a controversial debate at the invitation of the Republicans before the U.S. Congress, which was partly assessed as an opposition to Obama.
The speech was not spoken to Obama, and a meeting with reference to the previous election in Israel at its time.
In an emergency, a professor is about to shoot his friend.
Professor Shannon Lamb told in a notruff that he had shot his friend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "six dog" was still alive and probably dead, and he said that family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a written note that was critical of a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This stood by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who had been taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already moved 300 miles to the school country, where he had shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police chief Lynn Buford said University employees had heard the shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said that the Lamb once made the binding notruf.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamm took his life when the police replaced him.
One day after the shooting at the university, the students and teachers were forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what prompted Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees could see, helped him draw a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
The students said they were happy with his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentis died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the “miracle people” with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which comprises 17 members, and many students attended a course of two.
At the same time, there were some objections to problem behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously prayed to the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had a health problem.
In this year, he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, which had worked so hard for the Lamb, would not constitute a guarantee for him for an automatic way to an appointment as assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs' idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police found the later Lambs Spor when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun at a house's backyard about a mile south of his parents' house in the town street of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she thought he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogics.
He promoted in Pedagogic in the spring.
One of the longtime friends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and was 20 when she met a friend.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cooler guy who tried to bring you the guitar game for years.
He was the woman's bedroom at the time.
All the girls fall asleep when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson City of Brandon.
The Lamb and Prentiss were apparently together for some time.
In the Notraf, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no evidence of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the backstein house, which bordered on a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had been beaten 15 years ago, but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about her daughter.
You and your mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but his daughter Abigail heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when he and Abigail appeared on a summer market three years ago.
Later they played the one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for different companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes maintenance coordinator at The Jule Room, a weak-lighted bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night last night on September 5, after the Lamb had finished his guitar and mudharmonics game before a sporadic audience.
There were no signs that something didn't agree.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were in the room, and we were worried about each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American U.S. and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community, participated in a Christmas celebration.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the month course, while at the University of Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The instruction will be repeated on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contribute to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made notruf after he shot Schmidt, and that the Lamb in his Notref Prentiss, though, was named as his wife, but there is no indication that they had ever married.
Toys R Us plant to reduce working time for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there are not as many Christmas season workers as in the last year, but the toys and baby product dealers say that he will be given a chance to work more hours with his current employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it was planned to set up 40,000 people in towns and distribution centres throughout the country. In the spring of 2014, more than 45,000 workers were set up.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it would start with applications this month and the number of employees increased from October to December.
While the holiday days are even months away, the Christmas business is closer, and companies are ready to set up temporary workers to provide beds with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox laments his "Date" with Princess Diana
The prize of "Back to the Future" was professionally a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also noted for personal reasons.
"We are waiting in the theater for the Royals, and I note that the sitting next to me is empty, and I'll be quite clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a previous documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes me feel that I am a simulated ghost and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" was 30 years ago Premiere.
"It's real for me," said Spielberg, "unstratefully the biggest time film ever filmed."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Mon says that his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" in the conflict that lasted almost five years, and more weapons will only be used as a weapon of violence and destruction for millions of people.
The UN-Chief reiterates its call for all parties, including the UN Security Council, to cooperate and to support integrated negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - USA, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - at the end of the general assembly's ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the attacks in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional authorities "make this situation impossible."
Ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria, which they demonstrated when they reached a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 asked to show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a trap.
Others have abandoned him as a white man.
And some are waiting for a crash.
But regardless of how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranks on questions, it has not (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed that Donald Trump was leading in the secondary area, and some began to ask themselves seriously what it meant for the chances of naming the real estate mogul.
Of course it's too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the republican nomination.
Experts stressed that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, of which not only one state won the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election.
But foreign groups like Jeb Bushs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tromps Powers and begin to fly their dollar to push him.
Here are some current enquiries that suggest that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned to 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a question from the Monmouth University showed that only two of the ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul positive.
Until mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six of the 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of the Republicans had a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would either be "satisfied" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two of 10 said they would be "failed" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same entertainment as Trump (43 percent say they would be "inspired" about 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next thing in the matter of entertainment?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "satisfied" or "favored" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans do not view Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump is increasingly critical of his bombistic and misleading statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperature for a president, so ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans think he has the personality of an official, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office, and almost six of 10 dependants say that his temperature does not fit into the white house, such as ABC/Post.
Republican voters are familiar with the idea.
When they set up their educational institutes, Republican voters hold a real trup.
If they are asked who won the GOP nomination first, after a CNN/ORC survey in the past week, four out of ten say Trump is the best law.
That's a change since the time four of ten July put her money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters in the past did not have the clearest crystal balls.
At this time in the last cycle, four of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination for only 28% for the final candidates in the middle of Romney.
However, it turns out that a number of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign to be a Pussible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trup still beats almost anyone.
Some experts suggest that the extended field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while the anti-trump support has been distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffusion.
But a survey of the Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-and-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio 14 points in front of Walker 15 points in front of Jeb Bush 19 points in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-and-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would keep the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-and-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a few more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have made their votes firm.
Of course, it can happen much to change it, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46 percent said they let the door open to change to other candidates.
However, Trumps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other external page, the neurosurgery Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump, in his election contest two months ago, said immigrants from Mexico "more violent", the immigration was a three-and-a-a-half point in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bomber's way of expressing Trup's decisive Hispano Americans will be kept away from the Republican party and damage the reorientation attacks.
But after the new ABC/Post poll from Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the migration remains in the framework light, Donald Trump seems to do the same.
The fructration over the government points to new heights.
At Donald Trump and Ben Carson, about half of the support of Republican voters, especially by their foreign status, is at stake.
Six of the 10 Republicans say in the new Montags survey of ABC/Post they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also hot on Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Blomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of four Iowa republicans were frustrated by the Republicans at the Congress, 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "wallowed".
München, Sylt and Co.: The five exclusive residences of Germany
Here on the Hobookenway is the most expensive accommodation - with views of the North Sea Valley.
In the street, a square meter of a railway station costs EUR 73,300.
"Of course, the offer of objects is limited by nature," it says in the study - that is why the price is high.
A new study shows which special sites cost a square meter most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student's invitation in Munich are not really small.
In contrast to Germany's Top Wohnorten, one of the prizes is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Angel & Peoples has published a list of the most exclusive German residences - with square meters prices in high-speed heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter, well-marked.
But it's good who can afford it...
In other words, Munich is not even on the tip.
Championships League: Bayern Dream Start thanks to Müller and Gods
Two torch protections in Piréus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A happy encounter by Thomas Müller opened the way for the FC Bayern to a valuable 3:0 at the Olympics Prize - then loved's.
A sovereign reception of the champions League season.
World Master Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have protected the FC Bayern in the Hexenkessel of Piraeus in the "Mission Mailland".
The crew of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their prize at the League Championships at the Greek record teacher Olympics in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's Double Pack (52/90.+2) and God's hit (89.) with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th start-up in series will be the first step towards Finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guarddiola will finally take the anchorpot to Munich at the third stage.
Müller received helpful assistance from the Olympicakos Torwat Roberto, who, as a flunke thought, passed the World Master's prize in the 28th Championships League.
"We're not going to underestimate them," Captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game at Karaskakis Stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Münchners kept their word.
They showed a focused and committed idea without glancing.
Priius had won his youngest six home games in the Royal class, including the famous clubs like Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) was also proud.
However, the Bayerns, in seven European Cup dolls with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They took courage, but often in their offensive efforts, they went to work in vain.
The attacks were often put on the left-hand side of Douglas Costa, who rarely passed against the former Braunschweider Omar Eladellaoui.
Müller had more happiness than his flanke from the right half-field in the left top tore.
In the 67th minute the world teacher gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half had one Robert Lewandowski.
First, when the Olympics stormer Ideye Brown shot the Polish headball from the line (26).
Then by taking direct action, the Torwat Roberto paired with the knife (35.).
Although the Bayerns used to play a dominant game, Pirius could put Christmas stick.
But on Torrüter Manuel Neuer was released.
As soon as he tied an Ideye hole over the latte (56.).
Before the night, Guardiola had a four-storey case with David Alaba in the center near Jerome Boating, which did well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems, return to the frame, at first coming out.
The WM-held gave green light only after the completion of the training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If anyone wants to do anything else, that's already bad."
Also in the first exchange, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman to the accused Lewandowski (59).
Gods later came to Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by Elfmeter, the miller set another round.
Before the game, it was in the stadium to steal.
After a small group of partly inspired Bayern fans in their visitor block, apparently the guests of hosteber Piraeus were provoked by words and gestures, they attacked the security forces and led to beatings against the Munich allies.
At least a Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
Whoever smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Whoever laughs, not only damages the lungs, but also the teeth - this makes a long-term study of Potsdam.
The good news: When you forget, the risk is great.
Smokers have a clearly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is highlighted in the long-term study of an international research team, including several staff of the German Food Research Institute (DIFE) in Potsdam.
In comparison with non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth in advance was higher than the 2.5 to 3.6 times.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
Main causes for tooth loss are caries and dementations of the tooth flesh, emphasising the DIFE.
For this parodonitis, smoking is a risk factor, stressing the authors.
Therefore, the relationship between smoking and tooth loss goes back to more frequent dental fluids in smokers.
It is not clear that smoking also increases the risk of cancer.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk, but within a short time, the researchers wrote in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could last more than ten years until the threat again fell to the level of non-smokers, explained Professor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
People need to be convinced of becoming non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIFE: "Rauchen cuts the time of life."
Not to smoke is good for long and hard and also leads to good dental health to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of age were affected by toothlessness, sharing the DIFE.
Previous studies have already shown that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay.
The new long - term study underpins the findings.
Archeologists stood at Kolner Rheinfer on the rest of the Spatántica
The right Rheinüfer in Cologne has been made archeological foundations for several times.
In the vicinity of the building for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman German Museum have excavated Skelette and other historical buildings, said museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called landmarks.
The museum is always included in all construction projects in the city area of Cologne as an academia for archeological accommodation.
The archaeologists were now completed in the third construction section of the Rheinboulevard.
It has already been known from texts that at the place in the 4th century there was a fortress and a church in the 8th century, three explained.
In addition to the rest of the fortress and the church tower, a peaceful hall with about 350 graves was also discovered, which was probably part of the church.
Young Women of Good Courage
After a young woman at the railway station in Geilenkirchen Lindern was injured, the federal police asked the people for help.
On Wednesday morning, against 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the street building at the end of the train path and was picked up by a freight train that came from Monchengladbach.
Through the capture of the train, she, according to the Federal Police, suffered the most serious damage.
She was treated at a hospital with care and was brought to a hospital by rescue forces.
On the basis of the young woman's night-long cross-overover, there is no knowledge available to the authorities concerned.
The case may have been observed by witnesses or inhabitants have taken acoustic facts.
Inquiries are coming from residents or passengers of Linderner train, bikebäckerway, thomashofstraße and Lifefarther Street (L364).
Notices given about the cause of the accident can be given by telephone 0800/6888000 or by any other police station within the hour and free hotline of the federal police.
EU Commission proposes a new TTIP court in dispute
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current judicial system to address the planned Trans-Atlantic Free Trade Agreement.
The cross-border private clearing facilities for disputes between companies and states are therefore to be resolved by a transparent system, which is significantly more traditional in its functioning.
"We want to establish a system for which citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said in his presentation.
Sweden proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German Government announced support.
Through TTIP, the world's largest free trade zone is to be created with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current safeguard procedure provide that the EU and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, the US and third countries alike.
For the first time, there is also a second instance.
She would allow it to appeal against judgments.
As long as the parties to the proceedings agreed on the case-law, there was no objection to their judgments.
In the last month's discussion, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDN system in matters of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long run, they want to work on an international investment court on their own.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clarified.
In particular, the Investor State Schilling Procedures (ISDS) requested by large companies are considered one of the main reasons for major resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional penalties are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel litigation, the companies may impose a fine on taxpayers, violate national laws or violate consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinion, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact referred to the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that it should not apply to the free trade agreement already negotiated with Canada (Ceta).
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig (SPD), called the plans a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account the important points of the reform that Federal Minister of Agriculture Sigmar Gabriel has drawn up in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private security systems is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned against limiting the economic possibilities by too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could benefit from it.
When talks on the TTIP (Transsatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remains unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
The issue of investment protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
There should be a framework for the agreement already at the end of this year.
This term is no longer applicable.
Delicate People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Ten years ago Sufjan Stevens was sitting on the stage at the Colner Prime Club (now Luxor).
In addition to him, there is a flash map on which the most effective public singer has recorded the Malik US state Michigan with filtzstif.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is nearly caught by Stevens' speech.
He tells of different places that he always characterises on the map, about his minusious and rarely arranged songs.
Where they came from and what it looks like in his home.
Seither appears to be a wonderful creative irerre.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" it seems that composed songs that are very harmonically close to the American people of the late six-year-olds, but at any time can operate in great opulent.
It comes from the myth that "Michigan" would be the first part of a distant series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be considered as follows.
However, in 2004 and near Rheinne, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and has positive expectations.
We're going to cut Stevens down here.
Live enough guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the live musician back to the series in New York.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinois"), 2005 appears to be an exciting masterpiece.
Overboarded by ideas and stylistic endings.
The album stands in the American Billboard Charts and lacks no annual list of influential music media.
After overproductive experiments, Stevens then relied on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic spare parts.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and halls.
As long as the smaller clubs arise, the Bühnenshows here will be a beautiful spectacle of Neon star band and large fluorescent biendeco.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is visiting as part of a five-pound band by Germany.
In the dark Hamburger kept more!
Theater presents mostly since March the "Carrie & Lowell".
Although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, the well-known Stevens return to the privacy and the people.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians is playing through the wide-ranging album.
From the public you hear: the speech is "opulent" and thus you can remove the "plats on the ground".
At first, Stevens is thanking himself, playing a little older songs, and finally giving up under the present appeal.
Jeremy Corbyns Debüt at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election Mr Corbys Debüt has been waiting for the Prime Minister's hour of question with a break
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, will give his debut at the Prime Minister's hour of question and will be with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will be proud to ask the first of his six questions soon after noon, where his performance of the media is likely to be checked and his staff members are nearby.
He asked for "little theaters and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip a few meetings to leave his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbins' leadership, because it will come after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech on the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour President, during the day of the national ceremony at a memorial festival at 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Stille, has provoked criticism by a number of Tory MPs and is in the middle of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbys' decision not to sing the national hymns has brought attention to himself.
A speaker from Mr Corbyn said that he had "standed in a respectful style" and he recognized the "Herdenum of the Royal Air Force in the Air Force of England".
But a member of Mr Corbys Schattenkabnett, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had told the lab chairpersons to sing the national hymns, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of Schaten ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns Spitzenschaft, and they refer to differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The Political Correspondent of BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stabilized" within the lab, and that is to say Mr Corbys' remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the work proposed changes to remove the whole idea of a restriction as a whole.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow worker and pension minister said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of $26,000 to $23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President, David Cameron, since he is the Tory Chief, has been in opposition to the Dispatch Box in Parliament over the past decade.
The Labour President, who has promised another policy assignment, says he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for Mr Cameron's questions and has been given more than 30,000 arguments.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister's hour of question is too controversial, and that he will be left with both "fashionment" and the struggle with contradictions and, instead, has focused on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, who will be represented by the shadow of the Minister of Economy, if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is away.
He also shared the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the word and that he had spoken to John Bercow, the speaker of the house, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to get away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre" that was often associated with the Prime Minister's question. But a few years later, he admitted that he had failed to do so.
As she was first sent on television in 1990, she was viewed as the prime minister's barometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the house and his position among his fellow Members, although critics argued that she had become a cartoonist and needed further reforms.
'Geschossen in Joburg': Obscene young people trained in photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a narrower place if you are undiscovered.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and to earn a living.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was in Joburg) is a mediocre studio that teaches undisclosed young people how they take photos of their surroundings and achieve a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Fund increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The fund grew rapidly after data showing an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom. In parallel, FTSE 100 was increased by SABMiller's offer target.
Between May and July, the result without Boni in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same previous year.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and most rapid estimate over the time of an increase in interest rates.
The fund increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $1,5505 and was charged up to 0.84 % against the euro at €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1,49 % to 6,229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the transfer offer of the rival AB InBev was made.
A transaction would combine the world's two largest browsers and combine brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were more than 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury güter Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were all expected and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - reported growth again.
The share of Glencore rose by 5 % after the mountain industry said that it took $2.5 billion through a sale of shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losses on the index, and with a decrease of 4.3 % after Goldman Sachs had set his estimate for the company rating on "sale".
JD sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million.
The chief of JD Sports says higher wages threatened the expansion.
The business leader of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will equal the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer extra jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappy 21-year-old young, a hangover with overpassed freshness.
The type with the platinum hair is 100 million euros hard.
More than that.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 runs through.
Who Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has not heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the police are sitting on the cold rock platforms in the form of Berliner Luxury Hotel at Potsdamer Square.
The Bieber Building: Here is your idol, whose poster is still hanging in Stettin since Montagabend.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs as much as her mom Eve deserves in half a year.
If you don't mind.
It says, "In fact, my Victoria had to sit in the tenth grade in Gymnasium."
"I fill her with a dream."
School obligation?
Who's jockts?
The fans don't.
Neither does Bieber himself.
He didn't care.
For the advertising break in the superbows, he spent three million dollars, a two-year deal with an anti-Pickle firm playing many, many dollars on a beer account.
And with every pump that looks like he and over the cargo, Bieber also cashes.
If Justin Bieber drinks a cup of coffee, you're on the window table.
More than 100 million is supposed to have suffered like this.
Some say the Hype went too far.
Others point out that beeber is finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" on page 1.
Beeber himself, whose fourth album is to be followed in November, the many zeros are not interested for the first time.
At least you're like that.
Pegida Square brings Lebanon to the Cartopheledone idea
Cardboards or teeth?
It goes both - and it is in the cardboard that the former Imbis owner, Hani Alayh, has developed.
Inspired by the spray "Cartofel instead of Donner" on a plate of Pegida-movement, Alay Kartofel and meat together have been buried on a floor.
On the Idea, he brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the title "Cartoflen instead of Dunner", which he had seen occasionally on television.
Since then, in his shop, he has a grilled spade with meat and potatoes.
"It's multiculti for the magenta," says Alay.
The idea has allowed the Lebanese to enter into Munich between the patent.
It has been protected as a user pattern, as stated by the Authority.
As much meat and as many potatoes contain the stomach, Alay would therefore not delay.
Just so much: "It tastes better together," he finds.
The culinary people's understanding also comes to the attention of its customers.
Metcash launched a groundbreaking campaign to combat the death of old-fashioned
Metcash tries to protect IGA files before an old-fashioned march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Metcash food wholesaler has launched a underground campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the face of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 countries in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of the next year, Metacash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as on events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers run on board, with brands such as Eishers Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA countries and purchase owners who sell licensed tickets for South Australian Football to trusted customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment conducts its annual investor strategy day.
It is very important to play as South Australia and Western Australia generate almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA loading business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the East.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA retailers with a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will be eliminated by about five per cent of the food market in these two countries and all existing actors, but mainly by individual dealers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath from Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year, Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will achieve a turnover of 500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and food business and in the amount on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost metcash around $13 million in advance of interest and taxes, said Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the East, mainly to Aldi and Cole, although a recent inquiry by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most reliable.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's consumption in food and food business will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and that market share will be reduced from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash urged it to respond publicly to Mr Douglas' comments.
But it will be concluded that a member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt burden at the same time on consumption and margins.
However, the wholesaler is worth and invests more than $150 million to compare sales prices with Cole and Woolworths in hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their economies by fast growing fresh food and to provide a better choice of private label food.
Metcash's chief business leader, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and charging programs will be applied to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his conduct.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more praise than the president of the Australian Tennis League Steve Healy for his own conduct.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is always referred to as "Special Ks", is led by the famous introduction of Kirgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the framelight.
In a cool qualification game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the judge, where Harrison said, "Wowrinka would have to beat Kirgios, and I should have hit the child."
While he was last seen how he ran a tennis player after a race of a potential US-open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly protected by Healy.
The teenager is now in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth, about the second place in behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"One thing that I'm quite excited about is the fact that Thanasi was a little involved in the fight in my view," said Healy.
He broke a knife when he lost a fight in the US-opens, but he's not the first player to break a knife from the fruit with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has been extremely good in the US-opens, even under the very provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team about him, he's got a big family about him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He's a very rare 19-year-old, he's working very hard, and he's fit in the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the area of clothing, he's trained hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and efficient young guy, and I think he deserves to be assessed according to his own services.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account the important advance decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term solid component."
"First, we want the team to focus entirely on competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has made the rise very quickly, people like Federers and Murray have shown up. He's growing up in the eyes of the public, and he's made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions.
Europe’s Refugee Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the need and regulates the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and keeps everyone who tries to come into the country illegally. Everything with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border, as hundreds of migrants gathered in a country of no-one, and Serbian officials reacted with improvisation.
The people who had fled before the violence were trapped in an unknown route between the two control points of the country and built cells and lay down there for an unknown time.
But the fructrations are rising.
When a police officer pushed them over, the migrants scand "Opens the Border!" and shouted charges against Hungarian police.
Some show back from Protestant food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it would be "incapable" that migrants from Hungary would return, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not be a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries need to be held in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border was unable to agree a day after the 28th national block at a strategic meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in overcrowded Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that, finally - the next month or by the end of the year - would reach an agreement that the EU countries would have another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special European Union report on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on a valid action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions on the day of the service gave authorities more powers to address the crisis, so that they could stop roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto pointed out that his country also planned to build a steel roof along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it ended a sauna at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison sentences were used during the course of the strike to create the Stacheldraht Zaun between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major passport for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and at the point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has concluded that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who claim to protect - a view strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that take effect at night in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-metre (13 feet) high teeth that the government has allowed to build along the southern border to Serbia for a crime. These laws also impose higher penalty for convicted human dealers.
"In view of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of need," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Sweden.
We say very clearly: illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still agree with the use of the military, which will be expected for the next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for a long time.
Gyorgy Bacondi, a country security consultant for Orban, said that the authorities 45 people were already deeply involved in the country in an attempt to cross the border.
They come over by harming the zoo, they are now in police custody, and they are charged with the prosecution of crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the teeth quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossings with Serbia, after a train ride with steel wire to close the border.
Chaos gave the most important cross-border crossing to Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process data from people and press a crowd to enter.
About 20 came in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main bus connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they could travel to Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clintons Preservation of Bernie Sanders in national inquiry
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a bilateral precedent in the democratic race for nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her against land.
Clinton now has 47 per cent of the democratic voters' support in the elections (58 per cent before), while Sanders is second in place, with 27 per cent (up to 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is applying for the presidential office, receives 15 per cent of the democratic electorate's support.
More than five months before the election began, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates will support them.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has achieved some gains.
Clinton holds a great priority in women and men, but these priorities have decreased.
Your support in men has been very weak, and Sanders is just back here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters over 50 years has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a great lead in the older voters.
In the past month, Clinton was before Sanders with a double priority in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point origin in this group.
Almost half of the democratic electors of the elections have said that they would support with satisfaction Clinton if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations, and another 15% would only support them because they are the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly impressed by her.
The views are strongly mixed with those who do not now support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would be eager to support them.
While 48 per cent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with pleasure, less Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 per cent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), is that it is time for a woman to become a president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 per cent).
From Clinton's supporters, their connection to Bill Clinton (9 per cent) is also mentioned.
Agreement to deal with the problems and availability is also cited.
Since the Vice-President has a potential for the presidential office in the Waagscala, 57 per cent of the democratic electorate wants to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not.
If democratic voters are asked who would be the party's second choice, prayer is at the top.
From Clinton's guests more than half said that their second choice would be far ahead of Sanders.
In order not to apply for the nomination of Democrats, Hillary Clinton's pre-sanders increase from 20 points to 30 points in the competition without him running.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this number has fallen by 78 percent in the last month.
Prayer is a second time at this measurement, but the percentage that looks like it is the most "choice" has increased.
However, in the question of what is more important in a candidate, democratic electors are calling questions about the availability of elections.
As in the last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands for these voters as unacceptable.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features when selecting their party's preferences.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and pray to be honest and reliable and equipped with strong driving qualities.
Pray cuts at the three candidates' best than at honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Three percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, so many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not think of him.
Democratic voters of the elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and bids ideologically in line with their views.
At all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are continued as foreign minister during the term of office, most democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their views have not been affected at all.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail contests had no effect on their general opinions by Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wrong.
They are mostly Republican, more than six out of 10, who say their views have become worse from Clinton.
Although Clinton is considered honest and reliable by the voters of her party, this is still a problem for them all: only 32 per cent see them as honest and reliable, eight per cent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 per cent of the elected members do not hold them for an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the eligible countries also view Trump as being neither honest nor trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good notes on leadership.
The six tested candidates cut short bids, Carson and Bush best at honesty.
A majority see Sanders more than honest, but as with Carson, many don't think of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson leads to a country-wide survey near Donald Trump.
Ben Carson is at the latest CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates are divided between half the support of the voters in the new survey, and others lose dramaticly.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers. Support increases from 23% in the latest CBS survey conducted in Fox News debate last month to 27% in the service day survey.
However, Carson was at the same time from 6 % to 23 %.
The survey also indicated that Carson is well-adjusted in democratic groups and that Trup is passed among the Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasach, has been destroyed with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen most deeply, with 10% of support in the last month at 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in the third place.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was implemented in September.
The latest CNN/ORC questionnaire published last week shows that Carson is increasing in the questionnaires - it is at 19% of the aid granted to the Republicans after the storm with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
Looking at a carson rising last week, Trump found some sites for the former neurosurgery, even after Carson decided to question Tromps' beliefs.
"We need energy," said Trump on the last Saturday during a campaign trip in Iowa.
Applied bath temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees Fahrenheit [29 ° C].
Even if peak values are measured only on the remote side, there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water.
A bath in the North or Ossee can be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Fewer is no longer going to the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the north and east this week, shares the German Weather Service (DWD).
On the other hand, bath temperatures continue to provide the Mediterranean: In the east they reach up to 29 degrees.
There are 25 degrees in the Adriatic, 23 degrees in France.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College-Neulings
Almost two years after the death of a student during a shaky ritual of a student's association in Pocono Mountain, Pennsylvania, deaths will be filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baroness College Pi-Delta-psi-Browderschaft Schun "Michael" Deng was brutally arrested during an introduction in September 2013 and his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, shared with the police.
Officials said that he was heavily charged with a 30-pound rubber bag with a full sand and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to get over a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, and then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi-Brüderschaft do not call the emergency number 911 after you have been ill and apparently waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police.
However, they had the time to change their tone of clothing, to take his symptoms and to contact the national presidents of the brotherhood to hold the Council, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide tools and put the welfare of the brotherhood basically on the part of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be restored, and he died the next morning at his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with stupupef force injuries to his head, shoulders and shoulders.
"Many families have been destroyed by the Schikains of the Brotherhood. At least one student dies every year on the Schikains since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a legal lawyer who died in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be taken into account, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury by Monroe recommends a complaint for murder third grade for the first five members.
Twenty-three members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be accused of violent attacks and the formation of a criminal union.
"We not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved, but if there is an organization that has been officially or informally penalized, we will take them into account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has withdrawn its membership from the local group.
This will happen when the fed increases the interest rate
An increase in interest rates will come, and the house will be set up, the rent will be increased for loans, and the economy will be accompanied by a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will be held.
In particular, the history of the economy offers only a small start.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve when adding interest rates is often, even if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank stressed that investors should not concentrate on this when they start to raise interest rates, but rather on the time needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market participants could conclude that the entire increase in interest may have been exceeded.
"The first increase in the fed since the global financial crisis will without doubt be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the "serious money"," said Julian Jessop, head of the capital economy, in a communication to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the overall return of the U.S. coins to normal heights, but still to a low level to lead to seismic shock, which many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical view of how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the promotion of interest increases can make things a long way of flying.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a trend that assets will be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," German bank analysts said in a new study on what happens after interest increases in the fat.
It is said that in the last 35 years, the market is mostly on the rise – about 14 percent – on the road to the increase in interest rate, almost flat in the 250 days (meaning gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average rate of 14.4 percent based on an actual analysis published by Bob Doll, head of plant strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the growth cycle and the interest rate is beginning to decrease.
Reactions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the present case, the fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could speed up a resistance.
The most important point is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a price increase in the fat.
According to Deutsche Bank, there have been 118 interest increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, only a few expected this to be delayed and expected for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 per cent.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic culture could be risky and raise the question, "if this time is different," said the Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have been on an increase in interest rate for the party throughout the year, and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economies believe that the FOMC could allow an increase in this session, the future handle only provides a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study, all growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum at the BIP, and pre-resaction levels have been placed very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report said.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery of what was the worst resistance in the observed phase.
The current cycle is the longest time the fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months to the end.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market requires a price increase, and the pattern is relatively similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on investment is faster than on shares when their strategic course changes.
In addition, the interest rate appears to change the direction as soon as the first increase/sneaking takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle, the sponsors were immediately caught, the Deutsche Bank said.
The strategies of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a close combination of interest rates between longer and shorter loans and lead to a decline in the curve.
High-quality loans often bring better results in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the view of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profit curve is flater, credit spans have increased and the volume has increased - all features of the market when the fed strengthens its strategy.
In the larger and larger enterprises that attract the largest part of their business in the United States, they benefit from increasing interest rates and attracting local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will suffer worse because a growing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debt.
"The history shows that "Quality-" shares do not respond positively to three months after an initial increase in interest rates," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance have been over 5 percentage points between 1994 and 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns as well as low liquidity in their shares also exceed their pendants with low quality around averages 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.
In addition to the pure action games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Sparrows could see profits through higher results, even if experts are of different opinion how soon it will be found.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham.
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the sender for his "Verdummung"
He argues that it is not to be more different from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins took note of The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, asserts a leading member of parliament, and increases new pressure on the sender to prove that he does something that does not do the private senders.
The Conservative Officer Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-law radio operator is "misleading" and is increasingly no longer different from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like the word "dummen" - but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards that started in December last.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be only under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples that you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director-General showed the claims back and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public disclosure.
What I learn from Radio 3 will learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is an undertaking for live music and music that is truly unforgettable.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to give new jobs in order, I also really care about it," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it would have to work harder to engage the public if it did this in the past because the British are less aware of classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, however, which, during the hearing of the Committee on the Election of Culture, Media and Sport, was intended to bring commercial rivals to the feet.
The Tory director Damien Collins caught The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC, purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall concluded that the BBC 1-show - with Palma Faith and Boy George as a director - was produced "on special BBC ways".
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit out of our own house" when it was the next time it started a maintenance series.
However, he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the taxpayer for other maintenance formats.
Internet facilities increase in August at the longest and the Black Friday can be responsible for this.
In the first three months of 2015 there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using phones to buy
Experts believe that the Black Friday broke out in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been built, and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have changed to spirit cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that the online transactions are slowing, after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five per cent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales slow down after new numbers only seven percent of growth in the first three months 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back until 2000, then this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to Guardian.
He explained that the online sales increased three years ago to begin as buyers to engage in their phone purchases.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now that's slowing down, and we're probably going to experience a decrease in growth.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent changes.
Experts believe that buyers will resume their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, the average number of buyers was five times cut to make their computers, and some dealer websites broke down.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fought for shoes, could stop buying from it.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that of 5 £ issues more than 1 £ was published online.
In some products such as television and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via webshops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chain in the inner cities.
Muslims bury the victims in Mecca at the Kran-Unfall murder - Bin Ladens family will be Sanctified
The bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims at the first sights in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia partially contributes to the collapse of the heavy Saudi bin-laden group
The Ministry of Health said that 394 people were also injured after the cancer struck.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered, as 29 of the victims were taken through the streets to bury those who were killed, as a cancer on Mecca's Great Space.
Surprisingly filled, widely dressed in white, the streets to earn their respect, when the first of the dead drew their last trip to Al-Moaisse Peace Court.
The tree process went forward to the Holy Place, where just days earlier a building was built through the roofs of the mosque and then to the bathrooms.
The bodies were released for execution when the Saudi King imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 bets who were killed, when a cancer was shot by the Great Central Mekkas, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrim journey when the cancer submerged.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosche.
Saudi officials have already determined that the Hadsch to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the bin-laden group should not have stopped the arm of the disease if he had not been used.
An Arabic version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency said the Bin-Laden Group was responsible for the collapse.
The English news agency's service did not report this detail, but said that the company's management of foreign travel was prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman agreed to discover what caused the strain of the cancer, which broke into an inner courtyard of the Great Sea, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddsch, which later took place this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not made any statements about the outbreak of cancer, and its representatives are not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also addressed the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes around Mekka's large mosche as part of the massive construction project, which is directed by the bin-laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the master family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has taken larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a firstborn son who was adopted by the family in the 1990s.
The outbreak of the disease occurred in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stayed in the hospital.
Government representatives estimate that 1 million Rial (£174,000) are to be paid to the victims and the same amount is to be paid for permanent damage.
Other losses shall receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of the cheap Austrian handsman is over
Brits work increasingly hand workers, says Veronique Lauri
The number of qualified manual workers from Eastern Europe has increased behind
This means that 200 more screenfix layers are opened, which are designed to be hand-held.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close sales worldwide 60 B&Q
From Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British will lower their tires and pins in favour of the use of qualified oste-European manuals carrying out the work in their home.
If you are able to walk around with a hammer or a brush to attract walls, today you seem to be a minority.
Because the British are increasingly dealing with manual workers to carry out homework in their homes, as is the company's head behind B&Q.
Verónique Lauri, new business leader of Kingfisher, who owns the tree market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified manual workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at deep prices would be excessive.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops that are directed to manual workers and to close 60 B&Q sales.
Mrs. Lauriy said she wanted to hire more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions were made in the loading of women.
At the moment, the men were transferred to the staff.
She said that it was necessary to establish the growing demographic trends that show more female single households, which take more innovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie said: "It's still working for a lot of men in our branches.
We need to move this closer to a balance.
In principle, half of our clients from women with 80 per cent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Lauriy, who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has owned exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its business leadership and financial standing.
Mrs. Lauriy said: "This was a conscious decision - often here is an important issue.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the half-year period and the turnover after the group had incurred the costs of closing the towns.
Because of the trend, 200 new branches will be opened by Kingfisher, who owns the screwfix and B&Q.
Officers of Aich/Dob due to court interference
At the national court, Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball vis-visemist Aich/Dob were required to respond on Wednesday due to fraud and commission interference.
The accused did not confess.
One of them was also accused of abuse of the office.
From this draft, he was legally released in May.
The current process has been disabled.
According to Oberstatsanwalt Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it was crystallized that the appellants in the years 2006 to 2011 used the funds of the United States accounts for which they were expected to be available in their functions for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports staff are also charged for financial losses.
This fact was rejected by the President of the Society's Senate, Director Michaela Sanin.
It should be discussed at a later date.
The defence of the dispute showed that the Union was not at any time a party to the dispute.
The sports staff had calculated only outstanding damages and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and had invested much time and money, from the debts - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 Schilling in 2001.
"At that time we stood in front of the situation: will we lead the club further or will we stop?" said one of the prosecutors, who was in charge of the fund's major business examiner.
He then decided to take up this task with his colleagues and colleagues.
With all the risks.
"We have saved money, our life insurance is committed to the bank as security," he said at the conclusion.
The agreement has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, it can only be made innocent.
Furthermore, the payment of the damages has been decided in effect until 1991.
As a result, some of the damages have been paid just a few years later, that is, since 2003, as a plus on the account.
Therefore, there are also breakschallenges and non-detailed books, the former observatory explained the past.
The accounts and savings managed the two accused together, said the second accused.
The Court of Justice asked why the payments to the Union were not detailed.
The Union has not been interested in the details of the financial situation, it is important if only the freedom of debt has been the answer.
In 2011, a total of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the Union account when it started against a functional disclosure on the basis of official abuse.
That's what the prosecutors have been saying.
This securities account loved the name of the second defendant and was not known according to its statement to the Union.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The question remained unanswered for a long time.
Then he concluded that he believed this was the best for the union.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the government attorney put it in the room.
The mittaglag has been informed, the staff has been justified.
This translation has been formulated as "dangerous improvement".
Why the damage?, the judge and the government wanted to know.
The first accused claimed that he had not agreed with this formulation because the union had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With that you're all out of the snow."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the functional said that he had never touched a cent, he calculated only kilometres and diets.
At dinner he took into account the 1 000 euro per month, which had been much higher than the actual amount, added.
The defendants were unable to provide precise evidence for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an operating check, in which everything was properly assessed, they explained.
He also had a mile of money for the second charge.
All claims were made in the bar, so that he had to travel from his residence to the Bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the inquiry of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard is carrying 30,000 more jobs
In addition to the three-year staffing process, the computer industry will build another job when the company is starting.
The positions at U.S. computer series Hewlett-Packard (HP) are not final.
The U.S. technology companies plan to build from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in their company customers in the context of their restructuring.
This would allow the company to share costs of $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) on a business day.
The step will lead to a special charge of about $2.7 billion, which will fall from the fourth quarter.
The construction of 55,000 jobs has not been completed for three years.
HP employed around 302,000 employees at the end of the business year 2013/14.
After birth, the Hewlett Packard Act was 2.3 per cent.
The group with printers from the California Palo Alto is currently divided into: so that the computer and printing business should still be connected to a new society - apart from the more powerful areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business should be recorded on the board.
A resounding PC statement and a stronger demand for corporate customers after their services put the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the proportion of PCs and printers returned to 11.5 percent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
So the discharges went back in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a break and massive positions on the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only recently responded to the fact that customers strengthen smartphones and tablets rather than buy ordinary computers and keep more and more businesses online.
Whitman's restructuring plans totalling approximately 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: The majority supports the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be excessive: 54 per cent spoke out, 35 per cent voted in favour.
The other countries' air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria are 61% positive.
24 per cent, however, are involved in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian Machthaber Bashar al-Assad will result in 51 per cent of the respondents, 20 per cent.
29% couldn't decide.
Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
At the centre of the fair, the car itself and the electromobilities were networked until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Reconnected mobility" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA on Saturday.
The organizers of VDA's auto-connected VDA are estimated to have approximately 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Röszke: use of force at the Serbian-English border
The Hungarian police have used the Serbian border at Rözke Trenengas and water fighters against several hundred refugees.
Euronews Correspondent Daniel Bozsik has survived the violence at the border control point.
He reported on telephone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
However, a police unit was formed and behind the police there was a water tanker.
40 to 50 refugees started to beat with stones, bags and plastic bottles after the officials.
The officers first set up an uninterrupted pfeffer spray.
Then the police used Trenengas.
Many trains were promised in the direction of refugees.
That's how the group was solved.
The refugees are now waiting for something to come back.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the area.
Children who had taken the train will cry.
Other refugees slept together and left under the roof.
The Serbian police press speakers also experienced injuries through the use of Trenengas and Pfeffer spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Notebank
The world observes that the US note bank will come together on two days, Wednesday and Thursday to decide whether or not the benefits will be raised for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists who were asked by Reuters found that a little more than half that was still the last week of the view that the fed will do this now think that the fat will be further destroyed and the interest rates will be maintained at the present rate of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's seven years ago since the Fed quoted at NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance, billions of dollars will be added to the balance and generate only a small inflation.
However, the fed cannot ignore the less negative view of global relations.
She warned the markets to increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced by 20 a.m. MEZ on Thursday
Protection of death at Delta State University behind charges
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it was "leid doe" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it go away," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a professor of geography and social science at Delta State University, called the emergency number against 10:00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the officer of the emergency center that the police had to send the police to his home.
He said, "I married my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "six dog" is in the house, but that "no one will be ruined", but it will probably be stopped.
The police asked for his name, but he didn't give it to him.
Lamb didn't make a statement for his shoes.
When the police took the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a written note of Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could make it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb was 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as a policeman.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs' idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb claimed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said on Tuesday that it provided "no information, no evidence" for a "triectal relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who claimed that they had been married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were beaten 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and they were "damaged on the ground".
He said Prentiss was her daughter's best friends.
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Lindsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owns a dog named Lightning, has been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowless
The police said Lamb had called at a certain point on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail".
When the police arrested him on Highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb went his car to the side, flew to foot, loved in the woods, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from Delta State University in spring 2015 as indicated on the University's website.
Stars that have lost their lucky guy.
The player (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against Leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor also claimed to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this will certainly require his trip.
Eurowings: Air conditioning builds up companies
The Airhansa is planning a large company building.
A half billion euros a year want to save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's around 1000 leadership forces will cost the company's jobs.
With the pilot industry, there are new negotiations.
The Airhansa will build its corporate structure and evaluate the eurowings' ticket.
The aim of the new direction is to contribute around EUR 500 million per year from cost-effective energy, which the airline shared on Wednesday.
Among other things, there is no future management for the passenger business at the airport.
The Eurowings ticket fluline should be developed as personally as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garandt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future at the head of the board.
With the reopening, Spoh underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group wants to be present in the future against Ryanair and Easyjet.
So far, the organization of the 120,000 employees has been a complex company.
The airlines signed under the roof of the passengers Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual budget of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In accordance with the tariff agreement with the Cockpit (VC), negotiations should be resumed on this Thursday following the legally suspended strike.
That's what shared the deal with me.
The topic of the conversation should be the safety scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to come as soon as possible "in one year with a prognosisd record result".
The conflict between trade and Airlines has led to various strikes in the past months.
In addition to the pilot's transition, the "Wings" spectra is the "Wings" concept.
It is expected that the Airhansa will launch the Eurowings in the fight against competitors on behalf of the Group's Eurowings Billiline.
Under the title "Morgence in the South" images of Leena Krüger are to be seen in the artist's house.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months due to double fracturing
Luke Shaw experienced a double fracture of his right leg at the champions League of Manchester at the PSV Endhoven.
While this brought the left external defender to wine and will be excluded from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The destruction was caused by an unconsidered attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15 minutes after 20 years of old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be released tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a young man who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very hard and then plays fantasticly, and then it happens.
In the kitchen, he had a shower mask.
There's no need.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fraction, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to be a red map and the combination of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal insisted that the Italian judge had been late.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an elfmeter and a red card were missing.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how hard I am, my way to release now, I come back stronger."
About this: Manchester United leads to the loss of Luke Shaw at the PSV download site
With the European Mastership in France, the English-advisor has an additional invitation to attend the coming June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this type of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never our player's intention to hurt a opponent.
Moreno experienced a break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland's husband at the WM 2014.
"It's very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the enemy, and if you hear that it's a very bad injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
It wasn't possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was in a different direction, so it looked as if he had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel so bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a football game by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is a thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't last long until you know it almost exclusively.
Well, maybe you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorites child book, the Minister for The Lorax, who appeared in 1971, decided to appoint Dr. Seuss' environmental label.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a message on the company SuperCamps website, and continues: "Study, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I want to read to my children, because it always seems to give us a picture or a message we've missed before."
Everything is beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in Cameroon, describes the operation of the book rather than a series of contents of the 2012 film version, adds new characters and details to increase the very short original text.
"In the surrounding town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a product, a young man named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the daughter of his dreams by seeing her desire to be a real tree," one read. Dr. Seuss, whose real name Theodor Seuss Geisel was heard and died in 1991, was completely unknown.
As if it were not yet obvious: The text presented by Cameron reads partly like the composition of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Movie Database, and begins: "In the surrounding town of Thneed villa, where everything is artificial and even the air is a product, a young man named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the daughter of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little confidence in the operation of the book. Here a young man is hearing how the local environment is affected by the money laundering, falling trees, Thneed strutting on one another despite the protest of the so-called Lorax, an amazing, fast - moving being, "what speaks in the name of the trees," is being pushed away.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR assignment was delegated to a helper, who did not read the Lorax 20 times as a child.
A Downing Street speaker said the text was probably from Cameron's election agency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's staff was delivered, but no further direct comments were made.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the end of England's men, but it's still hard.
To stand in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the framework chosen by England for the tour, there is no repetition of the 3-0 test series installation on my map.
I wouldn't close a window.
Alastair Cooks Page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good Spin Players in the Batting Exhibition, and the Community spirit is strong; they will not take any narcenaries from 2012, just a youth-positive approach.
With the ball Moen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size on test level, it is an option for the attack.
About this message: Adam Lyth separates from the English test chain and is replaced by Alex Halles.
The decision to release Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult to analyse for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no questionnaires at Joe Root, for example, and this led to nomination, because - and I said this before - players are their own best choices.
Long ago Lyth had extended his course, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he looks forward to further running for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The English trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his stand even though he did not perform such good performances, and that doesn't surprise me; he is primarily a team man.
The question of how long a test shellman gets to set his characters is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only thing you can find was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Halles comes in here, and he's a soldier I appreciate very much.
He's an X-factor cricket player, which we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he reached 236 against us at a Trent Bridge place, what hit us very much.
At least he has to get the same opportunities as he has before him, but of course, this depends on manpower in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, months besides Cook, to get what an extra spin-bowler would get and get four quicks, fell on, and I didn't have anything to do with it.
I don't see why a man can't hit there, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's a devil-scarker from Cricket players.
Moen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He's got three hundred runnings right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as back-up spinner, and in my limited relationship with him he has impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - average 31 with the shooter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large number of backpants that raise their hands and trainers have chosen for young people.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the mansion, England has made a few hours of additions to trainerstab.
The appointment of Mahela Jaawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master cup.
He is one of the next cores of the game, which will bring a lot of experience, because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white bullet phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I have always felt that he has been created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela has ideas that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the surrounding cabin, even if the messages are in line with what has been said.
Collis team colleague at Durham, Ben Stokes, will not be used at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team makers do not decide the schedule.
And you have to think that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions will not be taken lightly.
The Brexit warehouse (Brexit = East Britain from the EU) could be won when the economy is in a fleet by 2017.
David Cameron's undisputed renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be put to worse with every day, even without the choice of the great Jeremy "Is it yes or not?" Corbyn to lead the lab or the TUCK, which is severely fragmented by Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States are deeply involved in various crises, such as the EU is now and not always due to their own debt, the United Kingdom itself's agenda with broken terms and agreements that they do not want most.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not be pleased if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
The Prime Minister and Finance Minister will climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a picture of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they will win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants to go to the outside of the UK within the EU's target - "Let us not only with France," says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short-term ministers and officials have arrived in some major cities to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's special Chancellor Angela Merkel is a link, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened in the long-term surprises like thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frances François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a dwindling power.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain has a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be washed up to help the Selfie Bridges whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's Austria from UK - something they do not want - because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Perhaps, therefore, some such ministers even deliberately fail to make helpful comments, all in the SNP-style, during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend is disappointed.
"The renegotiation was a pleasure" and "Great Britain has not gained anything from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how seriously the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU designers are the oligarchy of the press barones, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz Euro opportunists who have made a name as a "EU-Gerade Bananas" Brussels Correspondent in the early 1990s.
At all his apostasy, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-surgeon-surgeons, telephone hacking aliens and Pseudo non-residents who have most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about her, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you're going to share better bananas to get rid of him instead of his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had set out the principle of the EU's undisputed constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters who opened a door to it in 2005.
The press didn't give him that either.
But the black Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly look on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need any more time for me - it seems dangerous to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boycott Murdoch strategy of the 1980s, a mistake at that time and today.
It can endure, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbins' official position in Europe is - I stress it sometimes friendly - in development.
He says we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-coloured trend and the wildest fields of Tory's Small Englishism can say yes.
It's what Hillary said "A Ben, but no Ben" on radio and television this week, when the pathfinder fought in him, did not allow Corbin's appointment of the provocating John McDonnell as a shadow channeler to be a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father made an effort to be dishonest with his colleagues at work, without going too far and losing his office job.
Hillary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor did the JC tell his colleagues and members after all the reports on their closure at the Montagband.
What you always want to convey to Corbyn's impressive bottom-up image - think that he has even led me - news disciplines remain important in the time of TV around the clock and above all in the social media strudel, a frenzy of Paranoia and Verrat.
It is right to give Cameron no free maps for Europe, which allows him to support his work in the referendum campaign for a sense of self-determination, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
However, McDonnell and Corbins are fundamental witnesses of EU membership - in line with their so-called storage economy, their anti-capitalist past - not just a question of the esoteric discussion under left-hand dissidents, for which the Narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his majority certificates for Nato - Tom Watson is perfectly convinced that JC does not start a campaign for Austria - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their predecessors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital, - they also have mystical voters - to make decisions with the British if all of this can be pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government's power, where I was reminded at the start of the Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts critical Report of Public Health England on E-Zigaretten
Claims of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoke resulted from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who wrote in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) concluded Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Principal Report" last month and described it as an "extensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A leading article in the medical journal Lancet last month hit the "extraordinary winding ground", based on the PHE's most important conclusion.
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ and asked whether the claims were "to build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expected that the claim by PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoke" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were invited to develop a model for a multi-stakeholder decision analysis (MCDA) to conduct their views on the damages of various nicotine-contained products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose business leader should have received prior to British American Tobacco Metel (BAT) for an independent study.
He also described the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting explained that to receive funds from an e-sigarit manufacturer, but not the funding he was expected to receive from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of members of the panel are not provided, but are included in several known e-cigarette campaigns, some of which also provide sector funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the management of the tobacco of PHE.
The research work of the group "has been characterized by a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria", writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes were used as a way of smoking for children or non-smokers".
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ had already been answered.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies in his search.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are less than that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence indicates and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking disease, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
By providing clear evidence of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up East Enders, says former Chief of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs such as East Enders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit-shows such as Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the round fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK senders.
He criticised the BBC to place public-law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard-cut time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and envoys, such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been trying to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being ordered or sent, which would also be clearly shown by non-subsidised rivals," Johnson said to the Oberhouse Communications Committee in his research on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the function fee, which I do not hold in medium or long term for a good idea, you should at least produce its production on programs that do not make others or in order.
They send The Voice into a first-class window because they want to get as much support as possible for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a whiz, it's ridiculous, it's of course nothing.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax programme, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, East Enders is a further, dedicated to both own productions.
In fact, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this should be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, led by channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC should be on the hunt for evaluations "because of the ambitions of the people working there and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments to the BBC's most popular submissions show what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart contract in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC Shows should be sold as East Enders.
Johnson said that the public-law Nischen programmes "should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience quite well, but they're fulfilling their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their seemingly innocent missions for the correction of £4 billion, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscenities that nobody has seen."
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system with regard to conditions who can get the best value out of here.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for 150 £ per year, but for people who are a lot of money for 150 £, I wonder if this is true because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also attended the Committee on Tuesday, requested the BBC to verify their Reithian mission, "to inform, shape and maintain."
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it would be 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should take an example of this change in "information, clarify and maintain" to the public-legal television operators in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms he said that only one hand will be shown on the television, and enter commercial alliances to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells through spinal cells
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are hit with clipping pulses.
Scientists have developed viruses with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by shock waves.
The Winnipeg Nematodes change the direction in the moment they are hit with clangling pulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard.
The pulses work through the activation of monotron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
More on this subject: Read and write hierarchical activity with light
The researchers said that the Wurmers showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, at the ultrasound, to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the guard that a day's procedure could replace deep-stimulation, an invasive process that produces electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Fadenwurmers usually don't react to ultrasonic, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bottles, found out, strengthened the ultrasounds that then penetrate into the vampires.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves operate on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The shellwells affect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned, such as a Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically changed the walls so that some of her motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When ultrasonic is applied to the changed creatures, the shell cells are strengthened by the micro-boilers and are transferred to the tumors where they activate the modified motor neurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a slowing tool that enables the scientist to activate neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said Sonogenetics could have some benefits against this technology.
In contrast to light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain at an optical phase, low frequency ultrasonic waves can pass continuously and thus be sent to the brain from above to the damage.
"We believe that genotherapy and a therapeutic virus are possible to temporarily make the intended human neurons random for the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The exhibitions are dominated by British arms trade
See Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen Video.
That's terrible killings!
The foot-and-mouthed legs!
Streuben!
And electric shocks that cause painful pain, but don't leave a trail!
The happy voices and the Cartoon images are no doubt that this declaration for the world's largest weapons mass is a battle-like parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British Government's readiness into the framework of a repressive regime on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the exCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are to be seen at bus stop and in the U train train and require a second look.
"An important announcement: Do you travel from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line that turn to the image of a panzer.
In September, a shadow of weapons dealers will drive with the DLR ... Customers will be asked to help at the stop of the weapon trade.
The 300 posters are from artists who have performed their work at the museum for graous design in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £-pack of Inbus keys, which is claimed to "Access around a third of the bus stop area on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this platinum "Vandalism".

After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and Dozent at the University of Essex, artists will be critical and will try to bring political works to the public outside of Galeries.
Many artists engage with activists in protest movements at work and note that they have to work outside the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade plate is the pendler in the U-Bahn.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, which works in conjunction with the graphics and Voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the style that dominated the advertising for the weapon trade - through an exCeL calendar lecture, and he thought, "We give them the campaign to avoid them."
They played with the discovery of a more realistic firm application, but "it remains stronger through the blending with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us get the awareness about the sale of illegal folder devices on the show," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an inquisitive of the British Government and the guarantee that tracking equipment will not be treated illegally in front of our house.
Perhaps the most creative art around the gunmesse comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors perform fantastic euphetistic products.

Eight Golden Rules for the Life of Students Homes
Eight years ago, I went to a student home as a self - forgotten 19-year-old, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I can remind myself of the strains that I have raised - and the many long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The attendance in students' homes is from slightly nervous to completely disturbing.
It's exciting to be black: tell people where you're coming, where you've taken Saturday year, where you're on Corbyn and why you're " honestly told Marmite you don't love either, because in pregnancy, boys, it's just a hefe extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Take it easy.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It eases the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your Wimpers were burning in fire and these fire extinguishers were.
Let the people go.
The rooms of people are often transformed into drinking recipes, film-night event resorts and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people go to and turn their underdress.
On this subject: Don't think about starting in the Union with a relationship
Introverts receive a serious treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refugee, but many students' homes form a room-to-room-bum culture that is friendly and social and can lead to a lifelong friendship.
That could be the hell for someone who's trying to get on with it.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to leave to get back the energy I've used to interact with you."
Try to spy when a comitonee is created of beauty - and send him a SMS instead.
Approach: Don't touch it.
A gentleman in my student homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship with the back.
Since you start the union at the top of the back-mania, the key to the doors of people is to introduce themselves with a counter full of Brownies, less rarely than the greeting of the 1950s " Welcome to the neighborhood, I have brought you something back. So, and now please calm down if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering pets is a good way to close friendships.
Your inhabitants feel obliged to hold on and may eventually associate your face with a beautiful surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a competent baker.
Badly mixed pieces of honey, sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you attack.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the sound of hives is a dibstal, but is it the taking of a tropfen milk for your tea?
Check this out with the milk owner.
The chances are that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If anyone keeps your things, it's embarrassing, and you have my feelings - but try to treat them more balanced as my resident who added a spray to their milk to punish the dibes.
She's in prison now.
They should not make any noise, the people depend on sleep or work.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that you belong in the real sense of the word to the people who sit in the glasshouse.
A girl on my river asked her neighbors if it would make them feel better, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They reacted to it with even more loud music.
When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock, they let their neighbors sleep for two hours in a friendly manner before leaving their own music, closed their door and gave themselves to their three-hour examination.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would suddenly enter the same student home?
Would it not be far too sad if you were to keep a resident for your future spouse, get away with them, get away with them, and then have to see them every day and maybe live with them, as they would all of their friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot resident is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to make your life a little more meaningful.
At the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his key in his closed room, the border between an ulk and mobbing is better than it seems.
A good string is funny, but it only takes a moment until it gets to the boomerang.
Share a valuable and intimate lesson about safety - but never rent any room with teeth pasta and shampoo.
Lock your door, and place your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the refrigerator - but do not take their possession on the deck more than twice.
Line houses for refugees, single-zealing, ironing services
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the central French real estate house for people who don't have much money.
So about refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living room, but also the single mother and the generous server."
"I'll show you how you can still build cheap and good today," says the 44-year-old interview
Thousands of refugees are forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how to create a quickly more affordable living room: he builds a home for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Massive delivery in containers or tournament halls has no sustainability.
Because people remain a big part of it here.
In view of the refugee stream, we also need adequate living space in the next decade.
A whole banana, three-six-six-six-six-square house is the solution.
Gildner: A rain house needs the smallest place.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you bring people into the living quarters.
Each of the six houses that are built just in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each four asylum seekers.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily built according to their respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters living area per house is 184,000 euros, without any rent.
That's amazing.
Six months' time for the building.
That's right.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have successfully carried out my project.
In particular, it is always complicated by the sordid damocle black special construction and the positioning regulation.
That's awful.
It is still underway, who creates three apartments in a row house, needs at least three seats.
Only in the cities there is a lack of space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their project?
Gildner: There were some who suggested that I create luxury products for asylum seekers.
Which definitely doesn't agree.
But don't you push the competition to payable housing?
Gildner: It is true: In the last five years, we have had a tree in Germany, but luxury dwellings have been built that can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, also the normal people need a living room.
Not only refugees but also the single mother or the generous host.
I'll show you how you can still build nice and good today.
That's why it's going.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially worked with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple updates are published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration application, typing "General" and then selecting "Software update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they received an error message announcing that the "software update" has failed.
To change the problem, it is recommended that users either wait until the storm returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting Apps to create space - but Apple has made it even more dangerous by reducing the update. It will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is finished.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is up-to-date or located near a charging device so that the battery is loaded.
If the loading is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may be off half-way and this could lead to a interruption of the update.

You should also ensure that before your download you have reviewed our checklist of all things to prevent things from going wrong and protecting themselves if they do so. iOS 9 brings new features including a much clearer personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosbergs single currency: Full attack
Nico Rosberg, in the fight against the WM title in formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton, has only one more device: "Volle attack".
The WM-second stressed before the start in the decisive seven Overseas race, "that I have nothing to lose anymore."
53 points will be separated by the Vice-President of the World Cup in Singapore on this Sunday by title defender and two-phamion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the previous twelve seasons and has also taken the flag-grand-prix in the city as a favorite in attack.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city will have an impact on Singapore's great price, it is still unclear.
Since the day, it is a dark glass over the city, exposed by fire on the nearby island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfriend Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, joined another member in its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who held more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a prisoner of the Federal Service Cross 1. Class and honour citizens of the city of Espelkam and Lübecke.
The Schachclub in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a contribution, the president of Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible for players who cannot contribute to the membership.
Youth work and talent should also be advanced.
Gauselmann wishes to see the membership of the Schachclub and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weß" as an expression of his relationship with the city.
Quarter office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antinistif Age Centre have gathered under the cover of the Social Foundation and opened a new station at the Graffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations, you can also attend courses there.
The Social Foundation is seen from the mountain in the inner city.
That's exactly what I'm saying at the graffenberg square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, directly in addition to the shopping market, seniors and consultants will immediately receive information on issues such as care insurance or the services of hospitals and nursing centres.
Over the years, we have established with our ambulatory care service that often employees are allowed alone.
There are a lot of questions about this.
"And many of the services of the casinos will not rarely be taken into account because the complexity of insurance is not yet understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonist and Civil Hospital as well as for the ambulance services "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
That's where the salad was taken with the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as stress prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment may be used.
The offers from the senior centre and the Saludis are ideally available.
Saludis stands for prevention, care and reha.
"The Senior Centre for Care and Care," heike Riedel, director of Saludis, described.
The reason for opening the new district office in the city is seen by both business leaders in particular in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentral infrastructure impossible in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, the mayor, Wolfgang Metzner (SPD), in the event of the birth, also referred to the meeting of the Quartet Bureau at the age of: "There are many events and offers on the program and they are being presented to a regular level of commitment".
In this way, the Social Foundation has made a great contribution to the ability of seniors to live independently and well in their trusted environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 hours, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 hours, and from 10 to 12 hours each.
Entry by Bamberg against Würzburger kickers on 6 October
It is now official: After the trial work at the Fuchspark stadium of the term for the game FC Entry Bumberg against the third list of Würzburgers kickers was not yet established, the term was now established on 6 October.
The encounter of the FC entry Bumberg in the eastern end of the Bayerische Football Topopocals against the third list of FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalised.
Played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19 a.m. in Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are glad that we know now that when the game goes over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE teamman Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the map sales that are currently under way.
There is something special for our man to play against a third-list.
We therefore look forward to many visitors, and this is not without reason, because they have a special trip.
Around the last 16 men, the FC entry in Bamberg 2010 was awarded to the regional list of 1 FC Oberhaid (3:1) and to the home against the regional list 1. FC Sweyinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives EUR 5000 and qualifies for the first round of the 2016/2017 United Kingdom.
The title holder is a third-party SpVgg sub-haughty.
Wiener Architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is tot.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, as the artist’s house was announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses a member of honor and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was in the release.
Born in Vienna in 1922, many studied during and after World War II at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freer architect, but he has also been a teacher, writer and head of institutions.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for Formulation.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the building of the Schatz chamber in Viennaer Hofburg and to the construction of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.

30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have given his own statement in the past two years.
However, he did not have access to intellectual information.
Wiese allowed himself to cut the hair in the Bremer Innenstadt when he saw outside a parking lot, a list of punishments for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
In this case, Wiese strutted out of the store, chased the officials, and took the fall of money before the feet, as the "image" seal reports.
In Bremen City, the claim is confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual event are still not clear.
"The case is still under investigation," it is from Bremen City.
Only then will choose whether or not to show the way.
Authorities destroyed 4500 Marihuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-like climate of the Isla del Rey are best suited for the soils of the Marihuana plants.
For three days, the authorities of Panama cut out 4500 plants and burned them.
Men run on 17-year-old Afghans
Witness police are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 a.m., three young men were walking on the foot of Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, followed the police's two friends in a distance of about five metres and called on them to wait for him.
At this point, the group is located at the height of the bft dance station.
There were also three people standing on the ground of the tank station.
One of these men now screamed at the young men and beat him with the knife in his face.
The victim experienced a nose break and was severely bleeding from the nose.
When his two friends split up and threatened to attack the shooter, he first left off his victim.
The last young man was now taken home by his friends.
The tasker followed the group with a pkw to their apartment and went on demonstration several times over there.
When you saw the car no longer, the wounded went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the shooter and another man.
With the help of a locker, you checked on the face and overcrowded of the victim.
The injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there's only a good description of the action.
One of the men was about 180 meters tall.
The second slab was to be about 1,65 meters wide and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white hemd.
The police ask witnesses and indicators to report under telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice of field housing and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongol and Frank Müller (left) take the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Feltehausen.
In addition, Mr. Bernd Bormann, Mr. Uta Seim-Swartz and Mr. Assendorfs, Mr. Heinfried Kabert, are pleased.
In many places there are no doctors in the country - Assendorf has been lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Feltehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Feltehausen is at rest, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, is still with a half place on his side in the coming months.
After a construction phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October until he invests 310000 euros in space at St. Marcellus Street 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the field houses of Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongall, who now graduated from their vocational training in the Verden hospital, also wanted to adapt to practice.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Feltehausen and laughing.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The couple Müller chose the idea of performing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
As a benefit, he also sees soon to be his own boss.
And that's how it turned out to be that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen villas.
There, the two-fold Familyvater Frank Müller was also raised, his medical studio in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospital houses in Sullingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently active as an overarching officer in Sulingen, in addition to being appointed to lead Notarzt at the Diepholz Cross in 2009 and is committed honorably to the DRK-Brachhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19th, the practice will be prepared for the new chief.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen worked as a Hausertzt, his Kattin Ursel (Internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to go down as house doctors.
"The Endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongall.
After the construction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic surveys as well as long-term and leisure ECGs and need a more speech room.
In addition, the ETV will be completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 is received by the Müllers within the framework of a grant programme from the Land Cross (25,000 euros) and from the Community (12500 euros) and the Community (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," stressed Mayor Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients say Silvia Müller-Gongall comes every quarter into the practice of Feltehausen, in the Nordic average practice there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another household practice.
A positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller: The apotheque remains according to Ursel Feltehausen in Asendorf.
If no followers had been found, they would have gone.
Those who visit Müller's speech hours also continue to look in confidence: take over the seven medical exchanges and the cleaning power of the field house.
Their separation ends in Asendorf, however, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," recall Ursel Feltehausen smiling.
A little wehmut has been expecting her for a long time.
"But we're still living in Hohenmoor and many patients are sure to see it again and again," says the interiorist.
Your husband adds, "We have a 6000 square meters base piece."
"Bisher, I've always forced me to work in the garden, and now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two singles and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
"The border controls will now also be high at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
After all, it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum could also make this "self-conscious."
The supply and security of humans are in the foreground.
Of course, it is also "that there is a clear signal," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, nor over the Austrian-Slovene border.
There is a need for a controlled procedure.
Croatia considered "Korridor" - Slovenia rejected
The Croatian Government had previously informed Slovenia that it would also allow refugees to move to Austria and Germany and, under the circumstances, also to create corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the case with Interior Minister Vesna Györkós Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will increasingly intensify the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary.
The border with Croatia has already been severely controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to restrict its borders on refugees.
"Each member of the EU must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkós Znidar.
As the Croatian Government reported, the first refugees had already tried to travel to Austria on the border crossing of Tovarnik/Sid in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to attack her in the nearby Masfelden.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been regularly introduced in the Croatian Tavarnik.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
The rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country was counted with about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo to the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would turn to Croatia, reporting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, argues that it is to show people that certain routes are necessary: "We can do it again, we still want to do it," it said.
According to the media reports, in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid, another bus would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The Insassins had been on their way all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometers away from Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has arrived, so the police have told us that we should run here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel further through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
In fact, this could lead to the earlier Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Greece-Serbia-Serbian-Serbian-Serbian-Serbian-Sergarten-Serbian-Serbian-Serbian-Serbian-Serbian-Sergårn-Serge.
Croatia: "Inclusive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic stressed first that his country had prepared plans for possible exclusions for a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-schengen member, had "abstaining possibilities for border control".
There are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been involved in this since 2007 with EU partners, which has since provided the country with a good witness on border controls standard.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still standing behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they had spent the last night on the Horgos border crossing, which led to Russia.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Bakki Breg continue to be completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to move to the Croatian border, it is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to slow down in the middle of the evening at a local wedding in Horgos: He held the debate on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at this time.
It is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helping migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to share country maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not inevitable: in parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, which are still not covered by mines.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners were sent to the border region.
Börsen hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is expected to have heard a call from cyber criminals, which has been expected to have been repeatedly seen in unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Market Wire and PR Newswire since 2010.
Insider businesses should be made available to the financial markets with the information provided.
In this way, the investigators received over 100 million dollars as a whole.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders will be finally caught," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other accused were pending in the case.
Most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The actors should have acted both in the United States and in Eastern Europe.
Ocumenical Hospizif Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Parade Square, the government is ruling.
People experience their concerns, partly quick steps, partly bulging.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Car Salon at the Parade Square.
Hold the city streets.
Pulsian, dirty life with a great brain, and in the midst of four big tables each with the title "Before I die."...
The Ecumenical Hospice has highlighted this action on its 20-year-old existence and is facing mixed reactions.
"It's about life, that's why we went through the action between the city and the people," says Josephine Lamber.
The leader of the Ocumenical Hospital is also available to the passengers for questions and talks, as well as to the honourable staff.
While you may be able to reach a passenger spontaneous to the CD and the sentence to "see my life", "read", "run the Camper through the US", "stop the war" or "don't suffer for a long", stay away from others for a while, read, say words like "I'm not yet" and then go on.
There are still small discussions on the action, on life, on the treatment of death.
Peter Hübinger is also right in front of the place.
"Only if I make it clear that the end will ever come to me in this world, I can live responsiblely," says the Director of the Diakonian Mannheim, who is with the Caritas Vergener of the Oceanic Hospice.
Therefore, this public action will be good for 20 years.
The fact that not everyone wants to talk publicly on the tables, however, is understandable, is finally a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death was still held in front of Tabus, so the experience of Josephine Lamber, although the optimistic movement has contributed much in recent years to the opening of the people.
An estimate shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The dying and suffering companion belongs to the honourable staff of the first hour.
Through personal experience confronted with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the death assistance.
When the Ecumenical Hospices were looking for honorary assistance, they immediately reported and were on the ground in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 noble officials - 43 women and two men - accompanying the concerned and members in private households, hospitals, nursing homes, and in the exhibition Sankt Vincent.
They're all locked up carefully.
Angelika Godefroid can well relate to her task and to the experiences and experiences made there.
"I see the life of another waiter, keep it expensive and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of an ambulatory Ecomenic Hospice service is free of charge and free of charge.
The financial support of the hospitals and the donations of members and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of orphans and widows.
Every two years, training for new employees is offered.
The tables described on the same day are now in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal wishes can also be noted on postcards.
FedEx mixed results, reduced financial prospects for 2016
FedEx reports surprising results for the last quarter, and the supplier-Gigant reduced its profit perspective throughout the year due to the weak demand for demand services and higher costs in its underground transport service.
The company also said it was planning to host about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point, FedEx announced last year that the company wanted to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The share fell over 2.5 per cent in Premarket Manual 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the business year, which ends in the next May, 20 cent less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a question of FactSet $10.84.
The lower outlook is despite the price increases, which are averaged by 4.9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher subsidies for underground transport of heavy and large packages which will be raised from November.
The company said, however, it expected that the result would increase over the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in the online hand.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "gives solid income if it takes into account the weakest economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday employment plans were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS, which is planned to set up 90,000 to 95,000 additional labour forces, i.e. the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx worth $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result each share was $2.42 per share, nearly $2.44 per share, which predicted 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
The turnover increased by 5 percent to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been registering a return to international priority delivery in recent years, which led to the use of express transmission in its unit.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the consumption of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operational result was largely due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result was lower labour costs in the dispute.
In the Premarket Handel, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares amount to $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $15.15.
On Tuesday, they ended with 11 per cent loss for the year and 17 per cent under a record record on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategy spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the leadership for the first time almost a decade.
Looking at them at the end of the abandoned two-six sitting room, there is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has a twofold mandate from the Congress: maximising US employment and prices remain stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too difficult to predict. It will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to start, from the inexhaustible departure through the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
While most of the economic data show that they are strong, the latest turbulence in the global financial markets could make the already predictable Fed representatives reluctant to strengthen this flexibility by adding the interest rate for federal loans - and this is only a quarter of the point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing in the first line," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a prerequisite to not raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty about the global market is to wait for sufficient justice to continue," she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done by the fed, which will ensure the financial market itself.
About half of the economies recently questioned by Bloomberg have predicted a rise in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect an expectation of the fed, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance for an increase.
This indicates a decline in the share market if the fat increases the rate, it is because the strategies slow down the damage by promising that further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was resolved by expectations that the Fed-politics will maintain the seat this week, John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group, said.
It would be a surprise if the feds were to lift the bags at this time," he said.
If she did, "she had to go very far in her statement to slow down the financial markets so that she didn't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would slow the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the party is treated.
A month ago, the fat appeared on a good way to raise the rate of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow deterioration of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the morning and in the morning that this year despite the complaint by Liberals that more economic progress would be required, an increase in the rate was expected.
Although the creation of jobs was delayed in August, the improvement in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the fever is seen as full employment.
Loan increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation remained below the annual rate of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and need them because of the strain on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Head of Economics at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world ended up together in the last month after China had assessed its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May at its highest level, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would cause global growth.
The market has gained something this month, where the Dow is now about 10% below the height of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation when it is expected to increase the interest rate.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks, they would have taken the trains at this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow Flow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and an ex-employer of the US notation bank.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better in the grip.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describes developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main features of the federation, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's currency authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The only indication of the current leader, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013 that the Fed could "contain" its monetary expansion, solved conflicts around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Your decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabel, leader of the global strategy for managing the assets of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., observed this month that "the Fed has a history of over-reactions on financial market movements that seem not related to the economic background data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee used to raise interest, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its leadership by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "albeit limited to the impact of growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives withdrew these cuts.
The Fed should focus only on aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest-finding committee.
The latest turbulences don't get close to this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears a rise in interest, because the markets are rising," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it is amended, I do not believe that it should advance time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/store is a central starting point and offers an amazing number of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and jewelry, furniture, religious beauty and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The load is huge, and it takes over an hour to slow down through the tires.
If the whole shopping cart makes you hungry, there is a meal time for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garage (good and priced) in this store is close to the box and has different options for taking in.
What is here: Need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are priced and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai creams, fruit and more.
The meat tent is extensive, as well as the fish tent - the staff behind the tea will clean the fish and filtrate the fish and even feed on the will for you.
A good part of the load is the massive relief department. Here you can find frozen Curry leaves, biter melons and galgant, whole entens, fish, rinder blood and galleys, Swine-natural Darm, fish balsam, regional roots, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys one here: restaurant owners and kitchens, as well as individual families and individuals.
The wide ranges are suitable for car rentals and cables.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where he is: The cargo is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the border of Chinatown and the inner city - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has a private parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the loading is good, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small Lifesaving Aid for Refugees
More and more refugees come to Germany this day.
To provide you with a warm welcome, it does not go without the commitment of countless noble assistants.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support unusable asylum-makers in the city.
They belong to Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher of Leib and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses, she still loves to teach.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum competition room on the Dillinger Street.
There they help refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is all the other teaching than a proper school.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy styles
The Brazilian Paediatric Organization SPRS tries to explain in a shocking way how important good food is during the summer. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are on the breasts that are mixed with images of unhealthful foods.
Mother milk consists of a number of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need in order to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are forced to increase their daily calorie intake to about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results indicate that higher calorie consumption is not the only diet adjustment that mothers should make.
A current study led by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, the immune system can have a negative effect on the child’s unhealthful diet.
Exceptions to the new Bernrieder Sportshalle
The Bernried Community Council approved the construction contract for the EUR 2.3 million of its sports halls.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattened for solar system.
The plans for the long-sustained tournament building in Bernrieder Sports Countries are moving forward: In the recent Community conference, the proposed building project was rejected unanimously without major discussions.
Before that, the panel had decided, inter alia, to apply for a constructive "exemption" corresponding to "freedom" from the valid construction plan.
In the "exemption" it was granted for a special form concerning the design of the mind.
Then a "satellach with non-medium first and roof surface" should be created.
In the background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "Then we get a wonderful big south together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "freedom" went back to the idea that, for energy reasons, other than the construction plan, would be less than ten degrees.
This will significantly reduce the volume of the hall.
A "freedom" was therefore necessary because the construction plan on the roofing does not allow "exclusions" - with the Bernrieder community in general being more restrictive when applying for exemptions.
However, there is no reverse project in the turnhallen building: "We will not create a precedent for this," says Steigeberger.
The tour hall building at the sports center is a community project of the community and of the SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at around EUR 2.3 million.
Additions are expected from the promotion of education and public transport.
In the next process, the construction item is now presented for the 18 x 36 meters large hall to the Landrassamt.
Clinical Peichenberg is due to Schongau
The hospital Peichenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will be the new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of the employees move from Peichenberg to Schongau.
This is what the amazing plans of the hospital GmbH of the landscape, confirmed by the landscape director Andrea Jochner-Weß.
However, a decision shall be taken by the Supervisory Board and it shall come into force on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, almost 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Peichenberg.
The vast majority will be connected with fishermen and the further existing internal station to Schongau.
The rooms are available.
The workers who cannot follow Schongau should be offered a place of work in Weilheim, such as Jochner-Weß.
The staff will be informed of the plans.
The change has been resolved by Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been the medical director of Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year, and now has changed to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who should follow, Jochner-Weiß, the name "fisher" came to the game, which was ready to take the lead from 1 October to switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this means, in any case, an "assessment" and an extension of the offer in the "Interne Medicine" area.
Fischer is a specialist for heart surgeons and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized at the inner station on gastroenterological diseases.
Through the next two years, fishermen and their team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses, until the next year the old hospital of the button, which has more than 35 beds, is to be completed in Peichenberg after almost 140 years.
Until then, the Landcreis had planned this for 2018 when the current healing at the Hospital Weilheim has been completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weß, also president of the Supervisory Board, has no doubt that the house, which is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany, should be used in the future as an accommodation for asylum-makers.
"That's what I'm gonna do." As it goes on with the real estate, Jochner-weß couldn't say there's more to it.
There is now a short-term care of the caritas and a day-care clinic.
"What better thing could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come again," says Fischer about the Qasi approach to the body, which was taken by the employees "positively and very understandablely".
A real perspective for the house where Fischer has worked as a chef for over 30 years has not given it.
He has been asked by Mr Schongauer to take over the posts of the Medical Director.
The hospital Peißenberg (at least 100 beds) was again threatened by closure in the past decade, divisions were closed, for example surgery and birth aid.
The Rhein-Neckar Lõen's handballs are called tonight (20.15 p.m.) at the Belgian HC.
However, the Federal Table Leader is in Wuppertal, although the clear favorite, no one is allowed to be over-sustained.
In the last season, the bathrooms at the BHC were in a painful decline and there were some good things there.
Jadunfall with two injuries at Pratua
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their lunch break.
During the opening at a maisfeld in Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several prisoners were employed, as the police reported.
A 63- and 22-year-old man experienced serious injuries and was brought to hospitals.
The exact way it could get to the accident was clear at first.
The crime police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rheinland-Pfalz victims of violent crime
One suspect led the police to the body of the missing 16-year-olds from the Rhineland Pfalz since Saturday.
At the age of 20, the young were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rockenhouse.
A 16-year-old missing from the Rhineland Pfalz has been a victim of violence.
The young woman's body was found at the service station in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as reported by state authorities and police on Wednesday.
As a matter of fact, a 20-year-old man who followed the statement and led the investigators to the foundation of the body is also on duty.
The 16-year-old was missing on Sunday morning after arriving at the house on the morning following a visit to a cemetery in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigator first stood on personal objects of the victim.
Finally, in questioning in the company and the recognition of the missing persons, there was an argument against the 20-year-olds.
The forced actor then led the police to a channel in Rockenhouse, where the bodies were found.
The arrest was subsequently granted to the authorities in police custody who had killed 16-year-olds and placed the bodies in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be brought before the Court of Justice on Wednesday, which the investigators have given him a death sentence.
Conclusions on the next circumstances of the act should provide further insights.
Refugees Need Accommodations: Study in front of housing accidents
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a rewarding life.
The pressure on the housing market is increasing.
Social housing is a challenge.
The distribution wars on the German housing market have begun a long time ago.
With the coming refugees and workers from the EU, more and more people are forced into a market that has already been transferred to many major cities.
They compete with citizens with low incomes about the latest affordable housing.
In order to cover the demand for affordable housing, up to 2020, 400,000 new units had to be built every year.
This results in a study of the "Social Housing Building" association.
Compare: In this year 260,000 units are completed in Germany.
120,000 dwellings are missing.
Refugees are no longer required to live in an asylum seeker after the first three months of their stay.
Many then stood on the housing market and chose to stay in the long steps ahead of the apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, in the last year, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not limited to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also highlights significant disadvantages in the housing policy in recent years.
Germany plans a housing deficit, which will increase from year to year.
Currently, about 770,000 housing units have been missing in the balloon areas, the author of the study is Matthias Günther.
As a result, many professionals lived in major cities in WG rooms.
Young adults remain in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flow on the housing market.
In the larger cities, the number of square meters per head has been reduced for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Building" Foundation proposes a new start.
New incentives to recapture social housing.
This could be linked to the basic business tax and the basic tax for promoted dwellings would be suspended.
In addition, it is said that associations need attractive tax write-off options.
The support programme for the KfW State Bank's refugee accommodation is now being implemented in cities and communities.
A good week after the start, the Montagabend had already received more than half of the EUR 300 million available in Montagband with 184 million already.
The project could even be closed now.
Refugees have free leadership: Croatia and Slovenia direct Corridor
According to Hungary, there is virtually no more access, since more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to provide the passage through Slovenia to the north without any hibernation.
It's dangerous, though, but the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to understand with the neighboring Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area.
The EU country of Croatia is still not a Schengen country.
Following the closure of the Serbian-English border, hundreds of refugees were exiled to Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reported by the Croatian TV broadcaster RTL.
Hungary had adjusted its borders for refugees on the morning.
New laws that enter into force on the same day make too many regular asylum procedures in Hungary virtually obsolete.
Croatia wants to let refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic stated: "They can travel, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
But there were people who didn't want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked the first refugees at Serbia's border to the EU's neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning.
Most native media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived both with the bus and with taxis in the Serbian border city of Sid.
Right after their arrival, they had tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, however, refugees did not stand on border areas.
The border crossing creates other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mine rooms should now create a safe passage.
In Hungary, there are no more refugees after the border is closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people attacked.
Soon before the end of the day, there were 9380 still.
The new Hungarian laws put the cross-border abuse and damage as a punishment.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were instituted in the Sudanese border city of Szeged.
The defendants have been sentenced to up to five years and have been expelled from the country.
According to the immigration authorities, in the new Transit Zones, the new bordered areas, the total of 94 asylum applications were rejected on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - the most important Russian transition.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children as well as two older people.
In the morning, 40 refugees were still there.
Practically, however, no one has any more a view of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
Serbia is a "safe third country".
Retired asylum seekers are supposed to be fired there.
Before the Transit Zone in Russia, only a few hundred refugees were gathered.
In Russia workers began to sleep in this way.
They collected the furniture that had left tens of thousands of people in the past week on the street.
Spergitters were built and one of the receivers in the border area was built.
To this end, no one wanted to go outside.
Austria will reach only a few refugees after the border between Serbia and Hungary is closed.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants remained in the country after government elections.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people were waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train transport from there to Germany was stopped on the morning of the German authorities.
In freelassing, smaller groups of refugees are regularly encountered on foot.
Mayor was "Gesterndete" across the border
"We were working after the bridge festival on Sunday with the room, as suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of the cell," said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted the train to pass.
Since Germany was surprised by the flight stream on Sunday, because of the flow of refugees, the train with Austria was in Wernstein Castle," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beachmen together with two other aids and their cars on the border near Passau.
Before, we sold the unexpected guests once, with juice and drinks.
We just said we'll take them with the car to Passau.
"That was understandable to us," said the cityr in OÖN speech.
You were very grateful.
A man was not allowed to spend a large amount of money - 100 euros for the firefight.
"This has pleased us very much," said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers were on Sunday afternoon in Wells by an ICE in a regional direction Passau to try to cross the border after the recent announcement that the train was established to Germany.
However, the regional train was stopped at the border in Wernstein.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival is unique to the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, the days before a two-block race of sports – organised by the Union of Wernstein and Bayern from New York.
The fact that Victor Orbán is now sending thousands of visitors to us is a logical result of a apparent policy:
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately when building structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly backed up the Hungarian Government's position in the Danish region of national socialism.
The leaders of this policy are not just the Austrians who are now faced with Chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees must also be determined that the "dead country", which they have invited and welcomed, is no more than a refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flow of refugees and the coming winter, to create human rights opportunities for asylum seekers.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winterly accommodation
Konrad has to do everything with the delivery of refugees.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight.
The government has used the most powerful raffier banks to set up quarters for thousands of refugees.
The Chaos in the Traišikchen station has already arrived in the Griff.
"We don't have any obscenities anymore in Traiskrikchen," he reported from his first success.
Also the delivery of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday, whether without a large Wirebel, Konrad said and praised the organisational "Master's performance".
The Ministry of the Interior spoke against a "crisive situation".
Overall, Konrad calculates a requirement of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, more than 35,000 accommodations have to be found in the next week - 20,000 are to provide the countries with 15,000 of the bound.
If there's to be more refugees, we can create it.
"But it's not a phase without ground," said Konrad.
He has already spoken with the Head of State.
These would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Oberösterreich it works well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to explain how the church will help.
Large expectations are also set by the asylum coordinator in the ORF action "Help as we are".
On the platform, private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Mayer criticised yesterday the standards for the delivery as "very high".
In times of need it could not be that the quadrilateral must hold a certain height of the handle holder or the size of the light.
For a period of time, "Nottstandards" must apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Konrad has reason for his experience.
I am an older lord who is not told in the face of the uncertainty.
It's his main weapon.
Konrad and Mayer do not cause the Republic's costs, as they themselves declare.
They want to increase the number of employees to three to four.
Your own quartile research has not been successful until now.
Konrad wanted to build a container at the Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are obvious problems with permission.
Linz requires a better division
First, there is no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the provision of refugees.
This would not be necessary at the moment, since it would be possible to take action without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further locations should be checked on their visibility for the emergency.
Criticique is the head of the city in the division of refugees within the Federal Republic of Germany.
Other areas must also contribute here.
Seafarers: "limits are not fixed"
In a longer telephone with the Bayrian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday on further developments in refugee demand.
Seahofer has assured me that the German border will not be cleared.
The further areas of refugees in the Federal Republic will continue to be possible.
However, it is now subject to appropriate border controls.
In addition to refugees to Germany, there will be no more.
However, the applicants would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Leaders from other EU Member States requested more solidarity on the refugee issue once more.
The fact that Austria is now reintroduced to its borders is "a logical consequence" for Püringer from the past of the Germans.
The next runtastic is a question of time
The generalization of the "New Werft" in the Lizer Industry Series is officially completed.
In four of the six buildings of the office and production buildings, the cost-oriented IT Group S&T, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be avoided from the technology field by young innovative companies.
"In the IT are the deaf heads of our raw material - and we need to try to work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Lowerhouse.
He could imagine investing in the new Werft's start-up companies and then also buying what.
From the beginning, S&T wants to co-operate with the new neighbours - of which the Netherlands has promised: "The next runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested in the site by S&T, EUR 3.3 million from the technical centre, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Oberösterrich and the federal (FFG).
The building is packed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S&T and Techcenter.
30 per cent of the 2700 square meters left in the building have already been denied, further 40 per cent have been asked.
Lia-Peroni holder opened second business in the Arkade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are in the middle.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the tobacco market had to hand over a short hand: Finally, she has grown up in the form of another business place.
In the Furla shop against the business in which it sells, under other bags, bags, shoes and yarns of various manufacturers, everything is now intended to have 75 euros on the market of the Furla brand.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been operating since yesterday.
It was built several weeks ago.
"But I've been through for a long time, whether I should open another load," says Breit.
The decision was exclusive to the fact that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of a private place where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large area of Linz who sold this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who owns Italian roots.
Her fashion interests have gotten wide from her mother into the game.
I'm particularly touched when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women can't respond to the latest safety when looking at a beautiful hand bag.
Maybe it's because a nice bag appreciates every outfit.
The bridgemaker from Call City
The predecessors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are known as tenants.
This property is also linked to the billionaire who wants to be the president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for fans.
Whether he acts externally, acts out journalists, or exposes ignorance in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Presidential Assembly is making a strong effort to win the election fight.
And cut it off well.
This is also recorded in the Pfálic city of Kalll, where the capitals of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnführer is a term of many in the wine resort.
A few in the 1200-resident location is over -zig Ecken is connected to him.
His grandfather came from Kalllstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the electoral campaign mode.
The Kallstadterin Simone Wendel filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal of becoming the world's most powerful man?
"I think those who find it kind of exciting, but they are not so impressed in their call town type," says Simone Wendel.
The bourgeois Kalltädterin has filmed an amüssant documentary about the place and its famous sprüsslings, which also includes the Kechup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for information, also comes to the word "Kings of Kalllstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Call City.
He didn't bring it to the king of hearts.
While it gives respect before the family's performance, it also tends to think that Trump "has already been a little big man," Wendel says.
At the same time, the name Spitz, which has called the city around, "The Brulljesmaker" - to the German: the offerer, she says.
Thus, Trump comes from the village of the offerer.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather left and opened a place for gold miners in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate company was the first real estate purchase in New York.
But the life of the Grandparents was not free of tragedy: Your desire to return to the home for a long time was broken up in the Baerian state, which was once part of the Pafalz.
He did not take Trump because he had just left without permission, the director of the Institute for Pfélic History and People's Science, Roland Paul, had explained to the film start.
Trump is the single one of a "illegal alien".
This is contrary to the marked statements of the follow-up.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to discourage illegal immigrants.
"It's not as sympathetic as the poet," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote connected drums ("The Oma was a born drum, the Opa was born Heinz").
The winner in peace sees the Americans more distant, "he's always so exciting."
Does he believe Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He's never been around Call City."
The pension wizard Veronika Schramm mentions how some call townrs say that a family of Heinz spent something for the Churchorgel on a visit, which was generally good enough.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he didn't win the election because "he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good."
If those who had said the words at the time of his grandfather in the United States were like him, "he'd never come there."
"There are more interesting topics than he," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My President is not," she says.
And: "The dreams will also be realized without President Trump."
Wendels Film, which was long interviewed for the Trump film, has seen 12,000 cinematographs, and in the United States, interest is growing.
The overseas municipality of Ramsau at Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteiger village".
From the hand of the vice president at the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-einer village in the National Park of Berchtesgaden received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 mountain goats.
In the neighbouring country, the present Alpenverein is responsible for the award of the award.
A "Bergsteiger village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations, despite Nine's attempt to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson moved to Canberra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but there have been no major changes in the evaluations for today.
The morning show by Nine was excommunicated by the Bundeshaupt, when Malcolm Turnbull created the storm of Tony Abbott.
The Rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytag, came to London as part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This part of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise averaged 397.000 visitors to the five main cities, compared to today 339,000.
Today, there was a slight increase in rates for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the hole to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Up to September, Sunrise has averaged 349.000 visitors to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of the change concern these people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Raffers Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently inspired father who decides to let himself and his two children down on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million visitors.
Critics had asked if Thomson could bring a hit show Solo without the Raffers Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered with a clear "Yes".
The X-factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million visitors and led easily The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on the evening of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new Quiz show, modernized by Andrew O'Keefe in the average 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 am to 18:00) ran on 623.000 visitors - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (63,000).
The first half hour of The Chase Australia was 550,000 visitors at Montagaband, and in the second half, 720.000 sat.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The return to the quotas of the second night of The Chase Australia will probably agree that Hot Seat will be translated by 17:30 at the end.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for millions of dollars minutes that did not make it possible to skip McGuires Show.

The last three votes agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret enthralled? ...
Lana Jeavons-Flelows, Sarah Mackya and Snezana Marcoski may have been unbiased who won The Bachelor.
The woman, who was finally born in Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was held in the largest secretory.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be rewarded for being the one who received the last rose.
But when we with Sarah Mackya, Snezana Marcoski and Lana Jeavans Fellows on the day before being checked out of three, you may have given some indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips fixed until the end of Thursday
All three women have left their lives in a lyrical way why the perfect man is Wood and expressed his sense of humor, dignity, family values and a positive attitude as a reason why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If you don't, who should get the last rose of Woods?", their answers could be devastating to the player who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Flelows and Marcoski called both fast - apart from themselves - Mackya as the best partner for wood.
Sarah Mackya and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship since the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and (Sarahs) and Sams noticed energy, I said that they were quite compatible, and I thought about it all over the show," said Jeavons-Flelows.
"Sarah stands on the ground with both feet, it makes so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and they've got the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackya believes that she and Sam Wood would be better suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackya said that the last week of the visit made it clear that Wood could be "one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is not just a game - I'm stuck on him now," she said.
And when she was asked, she should choose a wood if she didn't, she was right there.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the rest of the remaining girls alike - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is released on Wednesday, 19:30, at ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent applications after his impressive open day of training last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches had connected Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a rank as it did the Austrian-Ruggby-Liga conversion on his first turning day on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a point and also in the current game after a destruction of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the surrounding cabin after the game.
Instead of beating his routines before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged her.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly at his press conference after the game.
The 49th sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who is happy to forget his past prisoner and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start, the Hayne and his massive Australian success for his NFL Debt.
Hayne left the game field running after the fuble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a bad start in his NFL careers,
"It was a thing that happened now, you only care about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his original Debüt in 2007, when a passport led to a trip for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
However, it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the students
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's rich man, was arrested on a Siberian role field with a gunfight.
After calling out President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company was accused of Yukos, and his democratic efforts were under way.
The free voters require the setting of 1,000 new teachers in Bayern due to the high refugee rates.
Party and Group Chief Hubert Aiwinger warned at the beginning of the FW-Herbst clause in Grandwall before a severe crisis at Bayerns Schools, if there are no new teachers for many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools before the collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"As soon as we get competitions in the Bavarian education system."
The country's daily fraction of the free elections takes place until Friday in the sub-Francian municipality.
In fact, there were other main topics.
But the number of refugees now dominates the free electoral movement.
"Of course, the theme of Asyl is going to be oversold the clause," said Aiwager.
Aiwanger requested the establishment of UN refugee protection zones in Syria, as it had been during the Yugoslavian war in the 1990s.
"That's not the way it goes, we have to go on the reasons," said the Free Electionr Chief.
Dedicated asylum seekers want to break free voters as soon as possible.
For this reason, Aiwanger also requested more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW Chief criticised that several federal countries were not consistent: "We need federally uniform standards of the federal countries."
"Bayern's going off, not another one."
"That's why we have to get more involved."
However, the country policy in Great Wall City should not fall below the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spain (CSU) started the pilot test "Middlestage plus" at 47 Gymnasian, which will test the extension of the gymnasium level from three to four years - the result will then be nine years to the studio.
But that's not going far enough.
"The G9 must be speeded up," said the FW Chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all Gymnasians who want it.
Free drive at G9 everywhere it is desired.

4 Killed After Police Shooting Gummy Shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot Gummishis in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, said an officer on Wednesday.
The violence took place at the service station in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district, said more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of whom had stolen stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police had used Trenengas and then shot him in the air before she got back to the rubber box.
20 police and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber smokes known to kill them, but which were traditionally used as less deadly alternatives, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The settlement was the last in weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi said that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want a own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent detention since 10.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have speeded up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators agreed this week on certain clauses in the Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The basic item is to be rebuilt at the Elder Youth Centre Old Post.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters.
Planned is a mix of trade, businesses and housing - concrete offers do not yet exist.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market about 4000 square meters of a large base in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Olde Post.
The preparations are currently under way.
It is planned to use the land for a mix of trade, businesses and housing.
You wait for the corresponding offers, it's from the city.
Which investor's asking questions is not clear yet.
Accordingly, no contracts have been concluded.
The city of Emden had a part of the property located on the Ring Street / Ecke Large Street, already bought a few months ago and allowed it to rent the existing building.
Project Hiev: Details are on the table
The plans for holiday rentals at the Small Seas take place at Emden.
The investor first proposed public plans for the project.
Some investors are still concerned - they are afraid of the sale of their freedom of choice.
Months after closed doors were negotiated, discussed, discussed and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home at the small sea are close to emdens on the table.
The stakeholders, the medium-sized Elder company "System Building", presented their plans for the first time in the Elder Council's Urban Development Committee.
This point was originally based on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critic and the FDP Group, who oversees the investor and the administration of secret cream, Ralf Behrends, from the system-building business, went to Offensive: "We have not yet answered all questions," he said before the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the roots now.
It has been in the debate for up to ten to twelve million euros.
Strong reactions among seafarers who came to the meeting call the pictures and new details to the hotel's desired construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the seabunden and member of the board of directors at the client's interest, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a risk lock that overlooks all other buildings."
In addition, he fears, like other project critics, that transport would take a heavy toll by the estimated size of the plant: "Then all busloads must come to account for it."
What happens exactly on the good hectare of the former guesthouse, however, is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we have to have a closed concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this is still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Two-year-olds at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
Frankfurter Zoo is happy to be growing up at his Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dean brought desires to the world yesterday.
Bicycles are rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it is called the Zoo.
The sex of newborn Gorilla-willings is still not clear, since Mother Dian holds her in her body for a while.
First, he reported the "image".
NHC says 60 percent chance for Cyclone south of the Cape Verden Islands ahead
On Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said a wide depth printing system was about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60-percent chance to develop into a tropical storm storm in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined deep-pressure system, about the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the small islands, also has a 60-percent potential to create a tropical storm in the next two days, adding the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double-spending campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double-spent campaign to provide $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, as they fled from war-torn countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to advertising the call on its blog.
Instead of allowing a manager to make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google worker who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"For our journey many dark roads and buses, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was happy.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are looking for help.
The expenditure will be made available to four community organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global collected costs up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee life will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has killed more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya during the war.

For mild excess diabetes, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether mildly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgery treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote a leading article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the magnet.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to eat.
Over the years, adipositas surgery has proved to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who have a body mass index of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight relative to size, is normally between 18.5 and 24.9.
A 25 or more BMI shows that someone is too heavy, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered fatty.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital have collected data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compared these to two types of adipositas surgery - magenbypass and brain cancer - to medical treatment for Type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation was from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those who received non-surgery diabetes treatment at approximately 29.
Among those who suffered from a surgical infection, 36% of diabetes was completely resolved and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved only by one percentage and by only about two percent.
In addition, the results of control of blood pressure, triglyceride and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgery' group", the authors found out.
Researchers also monitor the patient blood sample of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is kept at the best of 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin of A1c level was around 9% to around 6%.
However, the medical therapy group remained stable by about 8 per cent.
But this better "like control" - as you reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c Level - did not reduce mortality in five years, so did leading researchers Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares average results with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrictomy group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), increased backlogs in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and reported a complete over-diabetes (46.9 % vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show the survival benefits of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer life, Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, there were fatty people who undertook an adipositas operation, about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group trying more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in the surgical patients, Blackstone said that it was disappointing for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this sub-BMI group," she said, without increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin taking weight seriously while the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that as soon as they have collected these genetic changes that have bound their bodies to fattyness and diabetes, it is really difficult to turn."
Love Story Plays in Huntsbrück
It is a topic that is now more observed in the Belletricht: a young woman, at times unloved and invisible, encounters her youth’s dark again after years, and she loves herself.
So in a recent novel "We're actually not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the history of love, the Romans should be particularly interested in the reader, because he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding communities.
The main author is raised in Langweiler and is glad that she was able to set her home for a literary memory.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not attract all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies near the east.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in its speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which deals with ethical studies.
He asked that the interests of humanity be placed in the given circumstances before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is surprising, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to address the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To care for thousands of refugees, it is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, such as true peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how the killing in their countries will be reduced.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama also discussed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's trade after the terrorist attack of 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States had led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my opinion in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem was in the form of violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he resorted to violence, and this has led to unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hand-to-hand infections by children in the last 4 years
In the United States, the number of children under 12 years of age is nearly 400 percent higher than the number of adults who commit a serious alcoholic hand infection, according to Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of adoption of hand infection in children under 12 years of age reported by the poison control centres from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children come more often to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency reception," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a pattern of social media.
Videos on YouTube show how to drink young disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol - containing water to get a deeper drink.
Young children can be affected by attractive swelling of the disinfectant.
"A child doesn't think it's bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with soil, wine and orange juice that are very suitable for children.
Handicrafts contain between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.
In particular, in children, few sprayers can lead to alcohol consumption.
"It's the highest concentration of alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Center for Disease Control at the University of Kansas, Sender Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let Whisky get out of here, but people will let this hand-defective medium in the wealth of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick opportunity to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprays from earth’s deep - blooded hand infection in the school, was taken into emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice as high as the swans that are legally used in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, a non-infective doctor who treated her in the Winnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah listened to her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors watched them at night in a separate hospital on signs of hiern trauma, since the girl had fallen by alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very exciting," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs Mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand-in-hands outside the child’s richness.
In addition to alcohol consumption, some disinfectants were associated with fatalities.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died following the closure of hand-to-hand infections, which included a toxic non-declarated product.
Health authorities suspect that the product contains a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which has been reported as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in New York City were planning to spend their "common" teacher on antibacterial products around the educational area," reports a police report.
The teacher was highly allergic to hand-to-hand infection and was able to connect it from her room.
The police considered the proposed plan as "study" and pointed out disciplinary measures to the school authorities.
Flights: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old car driver was easily injured in an accident on the Querspane between Nordring and Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver went to the Querspane in the direction of cross-border transport industry and later admitted that there were two previous vehicles in the rail transport.
As a result, he drove his truck into the back of an audition and built this vehicle on an existing Ford Fiesta.
In the unsubstantiated vehicles, damages of about EUR 10 000 were caused, and the police were involved.
The 33-year-old audition was no longer prepared and had to be completed.
Respiratory and thoracic disorders: No dysfunction with Celtic
Griffiths plays down the gene of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila says that the Hopes are on a bad spot, but that he will return it again.
Hearts will be fought by SFA due to the charge of Neilson and Warburton will be cautious in January's new obligations that could destroy the unit of the framework.
Don't raise control over Celtic on five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, making the Dons a five-point match between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths play song about disharmony down
There are reports of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was designated by Griffiths spontan. This meant that he and his men's cameras were not under increased control, as they were preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch board leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are happy about it.
The lack of tidal competition in Scottish football - the Boer
The former Ranger's medal player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, since there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, now a messenger for Ajax, said: "In Holland they don't show any heights of Celtic games anymore, and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old-frequency games, and there are not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll drive things back, Deila's black.
Ronny Deila has agreed that Celtics have to fight, but the Norwegian chief is hard to turn things around.
After the landing against Malmö and the next departure from the League champions, the landing was followed by 10 men from Aberdeen, now clearly standing at the top of the table with five points.
Deila said, "Celtic had already had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that right - but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players better.
Now it's so important to be together.
Warburton cautiously at January-Transfers
Despite his comments only a few weeks ago, which indicated that he called for some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing updates and requires that he does not want to destroy the unity of the Ibrox framework.
The former chief of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this pre-session time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The man is really good.
Sometimes more damage will be done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with feedback
Swansea-Stürmer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, has indicated that he could go back if his contract was issued at Swans.
The 29-year-old has been beaten with a light knife for two years and has not made the departure from Wales in this summer.
Hearts on SFA sword due to Neilson's comments
The hearts led 2:1, when the father-son was sent from the field, and then lost 3:2; but the red card of the protector was later raised - the third red card of Collum, which was withdrawn in eight months.
Neilson remains by what he said, and needs to say, "I have not asked integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths black to avoid Tynecastle
The unblessed hippie was justified after he had given a song with disturbing lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The event occurred in a fight in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the hit of the eye," said the stormer, adding: "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it's not playing for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board trusts Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee Unit's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but it means that the downturn must end in the game field.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys back to the grass," said Donnelly.
McInnes is glad to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes suggests that his husband from Abberdeen had to fight with Hamilton Acices to see a seven-fold consecutive league victory, which led to five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no man who has won everything, in poker games or lies, the games of this kind have never won either."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent above the UK of 5.5 per cent, as shown by the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell to about 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary for Scotland, David Mundell, commented on the latest figures and said: "The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Interrupted the process
Since the security personnel could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of Pfefferspray could the officers take the majors safely.
An atomic alcohol test was performed at a 16-year-old 0,89 promille.
The nurse was arrested by her mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promilles and was at first in danger.
Why I'll be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a visitor gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the wedding reception.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation had already been made for the first time in January on his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I voted because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is agreed that journalists can see locations in the United States, and since there are often more applications than places available, there will be a nicer lotteries to decide who will be selected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five.
Who is selected to be observed without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossip's best friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship during the month with telephone calls and a two-hundred hour visit.
I like the core.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to bring a note and a tape to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma charged me on Twitter to express my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants, and you will get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "would have been better formed," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the public work of the movement will help him against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have made.
I don't want to go into all the details again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong likelihood that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his direction is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can refer.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
A man is forced to come from Canning River after a cold police chase.
The Canning Vale policeman remained in shock when he defeated the man from Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to quit the police was successful when he found himself in hot and cold water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "suckle him gently to get back to the victim."
The police from Canning Vale were called on Tuesday to a housebreak event in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, they tried to get them out to Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandl Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perahtec was not too eager to make his uniform ours, so he turned into a more reliable tactic - "A good cop is treated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try out," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master's football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins was in his car in the grave to get out of an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were successful, but inspired natives to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and stopped to finish racing
Peter Moody claims that Richards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his premises last year and stopped to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewarts and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were carrying out a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai due to a day-care treatment, the last storm on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing sport and he had found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive Cobalt Tupfer test at Lidaris which he could not explain.
He had been back for 18 months because of the spying threats and didn't want it to "see it as high-hanging dreams."
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I've lived on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live by what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to change my superiors, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do it, then I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
Then I have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Before, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out its steel.
"A month before Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were in a room with a man - whom I'll name if I ask - and offer him a job in my stations to provide information about what I'm doing inside my place," said Moody on Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a coward.
If that's the case, they should have taken their noses because they've lied to me when they tried to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of the RVL, David Moodie, Acting President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of it at the time and are still present.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved fairly and perhaps people outside of trains are responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and ignore me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now lets them think about it.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I'll drive the pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's Frustration Levels have developed with the long-standing Kobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late Scratching led to his saying that "he could borrow his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unencumbered master Black Caviar, referred to the race-day treatment rule "lightly", after a package of slamm or tone was placed on the horse legs, which was understood to be against the rules.
"It's against the rules of race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has accidentally slammed on the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday.
But it was the same on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a trionymetic disqualification for treatment with the pack on the run-day. An examination of this matter was opened.
It's a white one.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here's where you're going too far," said Moody.
Man in charge of driving
On the weekend, the police arrested a man after a meeting with a driver and a subsequent driver in Cobram.
The driver was introduced to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with the helicopter after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley train in the morning.
The police said the car driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia of the police took his place in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged for driving and leaving aid and for other transport modes.
The driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital. He is in a stable state.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy is fighting rivals because of claims to fight back
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism at the touch of his player as "Agenda seting" by two Prime League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said the counsellors allowed the Storm players "fighting" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly repeated comment to the Storm Team after his men had reached the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday. He announced the game a "model example" of Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the grace of his husband and said that she was focusing only on her "contact" at the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers to his men was likely to vote against him, since it meant that they were worried about being shot by the Storm team.
"This always happened again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about fighting when they shot us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks, we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he has apparently trained a great man. So he's probably not used to lose it, so it was a little shock for him.
It's already funny how this has always appeared again this year.
Bellamy struck Bennets' idea by the "suspending football" and reminded his mentor that Bennets St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "long-term" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game to our game on Saturday afternoon and how exciting it was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a long-term team, and Wayne said that he would take care of himself.
But now he has a team that can play and we see it as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters had a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two other trials in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or do they stop and don't do anything exciting?
It's the game plans for me.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right, either North Queensland Cowboys or the Chronulla Sharks on the next Saturday in the preliminary AAMI Park. The ticket sale begins in the next Tuesday.
Serbia with $200,000 charge for drug charges
A man who may have suffered a life-long punishment for his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine, which had been moved to Queensland, was released against a ransom of $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Solay, who came from South America over Vanuatu and settled in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was observed seeing his mittaglaglags in the yard during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life-long punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maximovic argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to possess the whole amount and that he could have been in the coffee for a shameless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the flight accident at Maximovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often traveled to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
At the trial, he accused the police of his residence.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had offered a total of 200,000 dollars as security together in order to achieve his release.
"After reading the self-defense statements of the two persons it is clear that the deposit of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Justice Flanaga.
But that alone won't be enough to stop him, don't appear, he warned.
Maximovic was released from prison under conditions that he gave his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police every day and held at an exit of 18:00-06:00.
Infall on A5 in Karlsruhe: Guidehouse meets each other
In a car accident with three trucks on the road 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on the service side.
Two of the three cars involved had broken down before a permanent building in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it late and tried to get out at the last minute, as the police told him.
The driver's home is totally different from that of the accident accident victim.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Brussels and Karlsruhe-North was completely closed over six hours until 2 hours.
There was a damage in the amount of 122,000 euros.
Stefan Hogg used the phone of girls to lock pedophiles to send images
A pédophiler used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stefan Hogg took the girl's phone, as this ship, entered an online e-mail service from which he received a number of independent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl grew up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it through, found the confused messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed the computers that were found under the address and discovered "related" Web research using the concepts for the search for independent images of children.
Hogg then claimed against the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "Pádophile on the Internet" and then "promoted to be a cop to scare them."
The state attorney Elid Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a search - that he was eager to scare people.
He said that the search was carried out on his computer, but he said it was because he wanted to be a cop to be a pedophile.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent the images to him and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lock her up.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the roof and on the wine.
Then she also saw the indistinct images on the phone and confronted the attackers.
The girl was interviewed and said that the charged computer and play station used to talk to girls who are much younger than he is.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty of having taken innocent images of children on 14 June last year, on 25 January this year had failed the charges and did not appear before a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his memory.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael delivered the ruling by October to receive background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted a causation, but because of hearings, other outstanding cases were held in the investigation department.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Keys soft on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being attacked outside the main points of control at the German-Austrian border.
Many key people were afraid of discovering and arresting people growing at smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side, a speaker from the Federal Police said.
During the Inn border crossings, more than 1,000 refugees have been arrested since Tuesday.
They were on foot over bridges and stairs reached the German side.
There they will be taken into custody by federal police and continued to be registered.
In Munich the main police station met more refugees than at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the week.
Up to 8:00 a.m., about 700 people had arrived in the capital city, a speaker said in the morning.
Following the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, the city was reached on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Exhibitor of Tropensturm "Herry" in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of midnight.
Because of a deep pressure area over Western Europe, the German weather service (DWD) in Stuttgart now flows hot sea air into the country.
The strong depth is the publisher of the Tropensturm "Herry" that has been taken over the Atlantic in the past few days by the Bermuda Islands.
Heavy storms and colds are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, until Thursday morning, it is also in the Black Forest, on the Swiss Alps and on the bottom of the lake, to count from 60 to 90 kilometers.
On Friday, then, the sun can be seen again.
The mass makes's: Every two years the car manufacturers on the IAA show their news.
2015 is mainly to be registered with the compact vehicles that are now especially well-selling.
Cars from the compact class are now especially asked: around 28.1 per cent of the new permits are performed according to the KBA only in August on this segment.
This is also true of IAA (public day 17 to 27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new overclass and luxury cars this year, in particular many new compact models are presented.
One of the largest premiums for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be held in the heart of the dealers.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra should also not be much more expensive.
Opel is the largest VW Golf competitor in view, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs €16,990.
The Astra has a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the horses offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which are first listed as tricyliner petrol.
Unlike the most important VW Golf competitors and Ford Focus, there is the Opel Astra first only as a five-year-old.
As the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi, which is already seen on the IAA.
And in addition to the astra on the IAA, what will be reported on the new compactate?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra-competitor Mégane into race.
At the fair, the Mégane is only to be seen as a fifth in a conventional and highly sports GT version.
In trade, he comes first in the next year, then also as a Kombo.
Infiniti: Infiniti is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan player wants to find his position with the new model in the strong growing segment.
The compact Infiniti fits perfectly in the design line of the brand.
The base component will be equipped with a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world prize in Frankfurt.
Offers will be the model with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1,0 liter turbo engine and a performance of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum threshold is based on manufacturer input at 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The beginning of the sale of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but around it is renewed the compact class model DS 4, which is to be seen on the IAA.
In addition, the designer of the former Citroën-Abbleger, in particular, pointed out to the front party: Here the Kühlergrill was redesigned and equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, in particular, the information system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and the first time Apples CarPlay was integrated.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are listed on the IAAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters Cells are humane
The Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex-trial court of the Court of Justice of Tegel, which has been handed over for months in a very small cell.
Because of the destruction of their human rights, prisoners have basically claimed financial damage if they have been exposed to too little cells.
This has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
The judges concerned may even hope for money if they were confined to the room for only a few days (see 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-combatant with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was transferred to a single cell with about five square metres of ground floor; the toilet was not totally decomposed.
After that, the man who was again on a free foot according to his lawyer was placed in a larger cell.
In fact, his arrest charges against the country of Berlin were dismissed because of the unwarranted legal conditions.
However, the Constitutional Court upheld the judgment of the Berlin Chamber and showed the case to be re-examined there.
You see the human dignity of man being damaged.
The Court of Justice now decides on the amount of damage
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days had been sufficient for the damage, whether it was a claim for compensation, it did.
Otherwise, it would be "to fear a violation of the protection of personal rights".
The chamber court must now clarify the amount of the damage.
In the past, the Constitutional Courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they spoke to a prisoner because he was shut up in a cell.
Humanely, a 2011 decision is therefore also the multiplicity of a cell without separate toilets.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which in November 2009 had demonstrated a humane surrender in a parallel case.
The same complaint was filed every three months between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in Karlsruer case.
The Berlin prisoners were also in prison in the last few weeks because of missing personnel.
As a result, 23 hours of imprisonment will continue to be closed, and aggression will continue to rise, even in the face of obstacles, it should have been due to the tense situation.
Following the arrival of the press stamps, 21 places in Tegel are not occupied due to lack of growth, 19 are to be removed in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We'll create it"
The migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor has decided to adopt them.
What's going on in Germany?
About 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to a forecast by the Federal Ministry, according to Visakazler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to raise a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create it, and we can create it."
What is happening in Germany is the following overview.
Various projections are used between 350,000 (assessment of the Bundesbauministrie) and 400000 (assessment of the Pestel Institute) of residences per year - and even for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it is built so far (250000 dwellings).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but especially in the case of affordable rental items: 60000 to 80000 social dwellings fall out of the rental price chain each year, and refugees will also be hired for these particularly valuable housing.
Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the promotion, from now on, 518 million to a billion euros.
It is very small in the eyes of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing needs to be created annually and for this reason the Union had to invest in an increase of 6.4 billion each year.
Some of them are scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who also have to provide more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates of the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 per cent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualification to assist them in their accession, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the assessment of value in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migration Research Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, Drönhardt said that it gave a political turn: from the ban on work for refugees to recognise work.
While an employment ban was previously imposed for asylum seekers for up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the residence obligation, which was limited to asylum seekers at a place of residence.
In society - even because of the lack of expertise - most of the way refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A large door for access to the labour market is lacking in German knowledge.
So far, there is no adequate supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are most often transmitted by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore based on the view of Thrönhardt of the King's Way of Labour Integration.
The Berlin School Board has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to Kitas, estimated to be ten to 15 percent: "It is only one very important thing for the parents to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschenbar, speakers for young people and families in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family, however, of the benefits of the Kita, the management lists are distributed in different languages.
If the need for educators is strong by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training skills - i.e. by allowing more training.
In the countries, schools without German knowledge are being prepared for education in welcome classes.
But they will not always be taught by trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no German asylum-makers or sufferers are opposed to the study - the only exception has been until Berlin, Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Student volunteers could facilitate access to higher education.
Because refugees with a residence permit or debt will no longer receive services under the asylum competition law when they start a study.
The latter is essentially not a burden, since they do not fall under the circle of the responsible persons.
Patient refugees had to live in Germany for up to four years in order to be entitled to a Bafeng from 1 January 2016 to cut these Spain to 15 months.
However, these financial failures must also be closed, and the German student network is requested by Steffen Krach, Berlin State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Network.
The students should be immediately informed.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successfully replace Islam with the same rights as the churches, and further develop the existing State Church law to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare bond that is professionally concerned about the newborns.
The rights also include obligations.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must be on clear contact and be ready to cooperate with the State in many areas and to take certain control options into account.
This includes the readiness to fight religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazeek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany on Thursday.
Those who wanted to challenge such conflicts in Germany, "had your right to stay here, in Germany, to fight," he said in the Bayerish Round.
He proposed that the basic law be translated into Arabic.
Integration will be much more in the future than it is today.
In order to change the majority society, the development of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany, however, has, as a result of European decisions, been an anti-discrimination system and a general equality law for nearly a decade.
However, it is very slow to learn how the NSU series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
The same opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and stakeholders have not known in Germany for a long time and what international agreements such as the German Anti-Terrorism Convention have to be realized in the coming years if the country remains at peace and uses its new citizens and citizens’ opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany has been able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, my doctor, Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"What man-power and capacity, we create it," he said to the daily mirror.
However, additional money must be spent in the system.
In order to avoid interruptions, Montgomery requires all users to issue health cards at the same time as registration.
The services provided could later be calculated with the German countries.
And for a long time, it would be the highest question to dismiss so many people with the restricted service catalogue, which provides for the asylum competition law.
On the other hand, doctors are primarily responsible for creating language barriers.
In the past, the Berlin Health Scientist Thea Borde has proved that migrants are worse off about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, including in medicine practice, it is recommended that dolmetscher costs be taken.
Many refugees, however, would have been helped with more general medical interventions in emergency clinics.
And with another diagnostic view.
In refugee children, there are a lot more untreated obstacles, and young people are talking about HIV.
With some other diseases, German doctors came from their training, but clearly, Montgomery means.
"Parastine or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as far as the medical obligation is concerned, it is possible that refugees may even look for relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they must prove their qualifications and, where possible, enable tests.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates of the Federal Psychiatry Psychiatric Hospital (BPtK): Most suffer from posttraumatic depression or depression.
They are particularly vulnerable to refugees, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study of TU Munich shows that every five Syrian refugees arrive traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumation disorder include the so-called flashbacks with Atemnot, Swindel, Hearts, and Deadsets.
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, severe shock and emotional fatigue.
In order to prevent the symptoms from chronic, it is necessary to treat early, explained Munz.
In the meantime, however, only four percent of the psychologically ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers may apply for psychotherapy in the social areas, the treatment usually lasts several months.
In addition, most social workers or doctors who are not trained for mental disorders would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misappropriation, says Munz.
Many ask for dreams
The Circus Probst comes back to the traditions of circus art with the new insensitivity.
The goal is to draw every age group into the band of fascinating acrobatics, animal resources and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites the mange to swim on the bike.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and Juniorchefin.
"Solidity" - under this motto is the current manoeuvre.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift to the guests is therefore in the blood.
"It is important to get people out of their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours," stressed the 27-year-old Juniorcheff.
"Manegencocktail with Worldstadt-Flair," says Director Reinhard Probst his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces talented artists from all over the world.
Exciting at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with white and charm in their band.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their work.
The Cuban duo wants to play a locker with the hero of the drum movie.
Lightness and mobility - they identify themselves with these words.
Her humorous art at Mass is supposed to get women's heroes in the storm.
In addition to many lachsalvens, the acrobatics of the Circus probst are also fascinating with fingers touch and ease.
Balance with the input line on a bullet?
For He Yuan, there's no problem.
Fascinating and squeezing people at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is trusted with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer lots in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stressed Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Dispositions in the attitude of circuses are only too often the subject of various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes the view: "It's not good for our animals, it's not good for us either."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "extraordinary artists", as they are called in love, will be read as soon as possible from the eyes.
We want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them.
The animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the mood either.
So the highest offer: provide good for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a blend from a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastuitt, the family is proud.
The two animals have been gathered together for eight years in a marriage and nothing has happened.
"But suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manoeuvre, but it is the unique mask of the circus probst.
For every visitor, there should be something like that.
"One is sure," says Stephanie Probst, "any matter of five or 1,200 visitors, we always give our best and are with all our hearts."
The Circus Probst will apply from 17 to 20 September every day for its proposals at 17 and 20 hours.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 hours.
Thursday is a family day, the prices are adjusted for the presentation about 17 hours.
In addition, the animal store is open every day from 10 to 18 hours.
Simbabwes Robert Mugabe holds false talks in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, at the beginning of the year from a podium, fell down the stairs.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
Parliament's opening was also prompted by allegations by the opposition's members that they had received anonymous threats of death and that they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with noises.
In the past month, they had abandoned him and interrupted him during his talk on the position of the nation in Parliament - that is what he continued on the day of his service.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones, which they had warned before, to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told journalists after Mugabes talk.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity will end in Parliament, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-packard will grow up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings in the company's services.
HP will later be divided into two companies registered in this year and separate the computer and printer business from its rapidly growing company hardware and its services business.
The expected stand-by cost leads to a charge of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who should lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focused than it is HP today, and we have a wide and verifiable portfolio of businesses supporting companies in transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As our own companies, we are better equipped than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers worldwide.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion a year's rate and "will be focused on the provision of less efficient, integrated technology solutions for companies" such as a company statement.
It is divided into a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to build electrical installations called the Palo Alto Garage "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has carried out a massive restructuring to address the withdrawal of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US-Tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the conviction that a focused company will deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Michael Arteta says team colleagues must stand before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed against Wilsher that it was only September and that if his rehabilitation continues according to the plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly be missed at least the next four games for England and, in view of his history, his participation in the next summer of the European Union is certainly unknown.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilsher had finished the last season after a separate bone injury and then returned to his old sweat during the pre-soon season.
"This kind of destruction does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that doesn't heal well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not connected to his bones or the injuries he had previously.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return to the season.
It also develops an unacceptable pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different diseases from Wilshere six years ago.
He also played only 65 of Arsenals 157 League games in the last five games.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight games since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League Clubs who have recorded most of the damages.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil race, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury will take place during the last season.
"Sometimes, if you come back from an injury, you have a time of distress, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win the battle," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins his champions-League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Deathham Hotspur the following Wednesday, and Wenger introduces a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not moving to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and the players who need to take a small break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is clear in favour of continuing through Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is part of the playgrounds with the largest bidder effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also uncomplicated after 41 games after the "unseen" campaign was launched in the last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was struck by a earthquake, which measured 3.2 on the directional scale.
This year was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has taken the lessons from the last season with the champions League capitalisation against Monaco and remains hopeful to lead the union with his management to his first European trip.
"This attraction is immense," said Wenger.
It hasn't happened to Arsenal yet.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're honest, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy Show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendship
The lack of similar exhibitions in Shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up is now even more doubtful than ever before, how suicide among young men proves to be a 15-year-old high.
In 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it remained three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the campaign against Living Miserrably (CALM - campaign against a boring life) announced 2015 as the man's year, with the aim of questioning culture, which prevents men from looking for help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A current study of more than 2,000 high-school students with depressed symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficient percentage of friends with "without voice", his chances of marriage were doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of healthy friends share the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you need to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the time of the social media communication, focusing on the style of substance, the immediateness of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have shown the necessity, strong, life-sustained and successful, doubled, even though in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extraterritorial values; money, image, social status, everything at internal value costs - our internal view of personal development and friendship, which has a far deeper impact on our spiritual health.
And as a video player and billionaire recently explained, money can't really buy happiness.
The good thing with friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined by the interaction as a friend.
The Humor of Joey and Chandlers are frequent wanderings, moments during football games in comfortable sessels and the sight of Ross to Rachel - all of this came from knowing that men can relate to it at any time, even if they often refuse to explore their feelings completely.
As a member of the telephone service explained to me, "my hearing role for people who feel depressed and have committed suicide has really shown me how the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old word "I'm right about it" has a huge effect, like the feeling that it's taken as a weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that makes me feel like I'm trying to offer longer-term treatment mechanisms.
It presents quite clearly the small moments of men's friendship.
So much my objective external status over the phone can also help people in the eyes of doubt, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the totally new-designed cults of the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink in the Central Park.
Or even better if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a break and say hello.
You don't know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria strives to help PSG to slow malmö down
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matudii and Edinson Cavani after his encounter with Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut at the League Championships on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass on to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course as the Paris Saint German champions League Season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his League Debüts champions as a PSG player who led the French Master on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally grew up as Cavani in 61 minutes.
With Real Madrid and Schachjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, as they not only seek to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but also improve on the way to the four finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But as they reached the points, there was no class game by Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's chance before the door. He was later replaced in the game against his home city team and the one he started his illustration career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or out in the League champions. Therefore it is a good start to win 2:0 to cause our opponents' problems and to look back slowly, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't reached one or two more doors."
After his defeat, Ibrahimovic returned to one of three changes to the Paris team, which was able to hold 2:2 in his own place against Bordeaux in the first League, but he was excommunicated in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentinan flying storm was named as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he explained why, when he entered the Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense, before he passed away in the long corner of the network.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, the Celtic in a play-off to achieve this level, is facing attack with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle of the field was a difficult opponent.
But besides a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who was far away from Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34 minutes of advance, they were little more than attacked.
On the contrary, PSG itself sometimes appeared, with some missing and bad conclusions, not the last of Ibrahimovic, who was subjected to no less than five attempts in the first half and then stopped after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more news when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic, who turned Di Maria into a trial committee, which was transferred by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the pphoste...
The second tower ended up shortly after the hour-mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth season, after Ibrahimovic had set up a left bottle of Maxwell.
It ended all the thought that Malmö could come back to the game, and only a wonderful introduction from Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the outcome low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was finally informed of a tower.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later said that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last champions-League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which has not had the same level.
Qualification games are not enough."
Get out of our Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion by sale of shares
In Switzerland, the mountainbuilding-Rise Glencore, which is affected by rising raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion by a sale of shares as part of its huge debt plan.
Glencore, registered in London, said in a statement that it has sold new shares in the value of approximately 1.6 billion £ in order to repay its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling raw materials prices, as China's economic breakdown pressures demand and is increasingly affecting markets.
The issue of rights of reference led to a dramatic increase in the peaks of London's Börse in trade early in the morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69 per cent above.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion sale of assets as part of the comprehensive plan to cover around a third of his $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on the closing course on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Reflecting on a long-term hidden growth in China, ice prices have reduced by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices by 20 to 40 percent.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola stopped 2008 Switching to FC Bayern
World and European Master Xavi has been playing since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sports Club in Qatar
The FC Bayern was apparently a few years before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who was playing for the Barcelona FC.
Eight times Spanish master, three times poker winner, four times champions League winner, two times club world master, two times European master, once world master - the title list of Xavi is impressive.
In summer, the average 35 years after 24 years left the FC Barcelona and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with the Marca Xavi now reports that he had already stood before the EM 2008 before the departure from Barcelona.
"I told me that Barza wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we won't do anything," he says.
And it also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was a offer from Bayern."
"Romange wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change didn't happen.
And the distinguished man today works for the German Recordmaster: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has taken Guardiola under contract and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the man without me."
"That's why he beat me."
Who knows how Bayerns would run with Xavi in 2008/2009.
Xavi stood for Barca in the fourth final of the champions League against the Bayerns over the entire distance on the race, turned the wheels off (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the king's class triumph.
Matt Damon plays many times in film creations
Matt Damon faced the Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she won't be needed behind the scenes.
During a follow-up to Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown stressed the need for alternative perspectives and, in the case of a black protagonist in the selected drawbook of the project.
"When we talk about variety, then do it when film is done and not when the show is done," Damon assured.
Brown responded shocked, with angry disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments of the actor of The Martian were confirmed.
Damon and Brown concluded with the producers' colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly Brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of the harmony," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she is a benefit that will be paid by her white lender.
The producer of Dear White People set up for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the king's rights in the film; Damon insisted that their reign "may eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was released, the social media exploded before misinformation about Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni pushed his tongue out over the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that it does weh".
The Tweet has earned more than 5,000 rights and 4,000 Likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the young man Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the movement of Black Lives Matter was aimed at spreading the country's influence and pressure on lawmakers and authorities, discriminatory practices against color content.
In February, the singer Prince played a role in the movement during the introduction of the famous albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still mother," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In more recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement and, in response to the issue of Fox News personality Elizabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be viewed as a Hass group.
"The Black Live Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Before long, it was announced that Damon was on a list of stakeholders, producers and mediamogules invited to visit the pope to discuss the appearance of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope, it is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' won the first champion
Professional sports clothing and service assistant Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million with home.
The competition show, which just ended its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all the stages of its barrier race.
During the season, there were two men, Caldiero and Kameramann Geoff Britten, until the end.
For the last task, the clothing was on a 75 foot long strip in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time when he was the first athletes who completed the intense phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds earlier, which made him a winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard fight, still under shock about the profit of the great price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his money.
As suddenly as I can't imagine, how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed set up with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brittes, although he was the first to complete the course, did not receive any prizes.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it gets that with the fastest time," said Wed.
As the money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great grace.
I don't think he's got any grolls on it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family nurse.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be killed by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt so much if they had replaced the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eight-stage staff, which will start work in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers like Minnesota Twins across
MINEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are at the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as a shooter, but this part played perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the field target field.
The Twins used a chance to rise within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard square.
For Detroit, although only for one night, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which was to take over a large part of the second half of the season so hard.
"All victorys make fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit three times in the first two inhalation points, then one in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) ran 6 times in the 1/3 interns and allowed three runs.
It was his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to end this year very hard," said Simon.
It's hard to play any game in the Bullpen, and that's why I want to concentrate totally on the game.
The design Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first driver-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He's got a good shot of the wood," said Ausmus.
He looked well out of the (schlag training), saw clearly better out of the bubbles, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three rounds at the end of the seventh round, the Twins had their best chance to get back to the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the entrance with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bridge, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by the Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Mauer, the only man he was faced with, before the designed Rokie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who entered a two-wheeled run.
With a couple of runners and the finish run on the second round, the third baseman Trevor Plouffe brought to a double play.
It was the 27th time in Major League this season that Plouffe played a Double Play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth Inning, the wall created a RBI double against the locker of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the position of 5-4.
However, the right-hand man stood up Sano at three points for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from the capture of the game by a yet not moving Phil Hughes.
The tigers achieved three rounds in the first two attacks against the right-wing veteran, who was beaten before the game by the victim list, after he had been missing more than a month because of a return guide.
"It's obviously not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I went out and said that I would create some pretty good pieces there in the third place."
After they received the leadoff battery first, Hushes gave up a single on second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the score position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, created another run, but Victor Martinez was expelled from the game when he tried to reach the third, which led to the threat.
The tigers made a single-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center field Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a great blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't have a very good shot, but he's got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, no points were drawn in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reliever Lawyer A.J. after.
In Hughes, there were three runnings at six hits and a four-stringed wheel.
WARNING: Tigers of RHP Anibal Sanchez were shot because of an injury to the victims.
He will be investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the debt of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the list of losses due to a loss, should be activated for the start at midnight.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is drawn from the list of losses to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20th because of a breach in the right joint.
The tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in the field target on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.33)
Hundreds of refugees are expected to arrive in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people concerned should then be sent to news events in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden reported on the service day.
She calculated with 450 to 750 refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital were prepared in the past days for this case.
Up to 1000 refugees can arrive there temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other communities.
Only in the past ten days, according to the Government Bureau responsible for the recovery, Gieten 7500 people have arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also arranged for large numbers of refugees in sports halls.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The leader of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity.
"I believe that the different thoughts about military action options cannot be found without Germany," he said.
He called the European states 'collective visas'.
Four years ago, it was a pleasure to see that the cause of a military involvement in Germany was over.
"Now the conflict breaks out in front of our door," he said in Germany.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive rise in international aid for refugees.
Austria controlled by the southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained that no one will be sent back to Hungary at the service station in the Austrian TV channel ORF.
Germany has also not sent refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement that, after Germany, a certain number of refugees from Austria could be admitted every day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
It did not mention specific numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past days tens of thousands of refugees had arrived on the so-called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria.
Your goal is mainly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, invited a special fee for the next week.
Germany had begun with previous border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to adapt to a common procedure in the crisis.
EU Interior Ministers want to take a new initiative on the coming Tuesday (September 22nd) at a special meeting on the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong flow of refugees in Germany, the Federation wants to strengthen its support for the creation and distribution of human beings.
This will be shared with the countries, announced by Merkel on the late Tuesday following almost four thousand consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's office in Berlin.
Marks are undermining those people who need protection, too.
However, those who do not have a living perspective cannot remain in Germany either.
This opinion has been explicitly shared around.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now needs to deal with a "relative force effort".
Thousands of doubted refugees are trapped between the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border to Serbia on the night of the service.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border on Romania would be cut off with a teeth.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent Schlepper from looking for foreign routes across Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said to the planned new border zone.
The Romanian government condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the teeth.
In Turkey, therefore, there were thousands of other migrants following eye-catching reports on the Greek border.
Space "Cassini" finds Ozean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the flagship of the Saturnmonds Enceladus, a global ocean is floating.
It's closed by researchers from observation of the Cassini area.
And then the moon slowly melts on its path around the ring planets.
This tummel movement is only small, but still too large for a continuous fixed heavenly body, it is in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, U.S.A. on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the "Icarus" section.
It has been known for a long time that it must be given under the ice cover of Enceladus liquid water.
Thus, Cassini had already discovered in 2006 Eisvulcane in the South Pole of Saturnmonds to save water pumps and ice-creams and thereby feed the so-called E-Ring of the Saturn.
At least in the South Pole there must be a subterranean sea, closing the astronomers at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to spend about a month on Offensivactor Valded Rama.
An investigation has resulted in an adjudicator injury in the 27-year-olds, the association shared.
Rama had already complained at the beginning of the week about pain.
According to Münchner Lüöen, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced rest".
"That's hard for us, Rama is a great loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "image" set with a view to the possible obligation of an unencumbered profession.
However, as a training guest, the Sixzigers first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already in VfL Wolfsburg under contract.
The Croatian now has "the opportunity to demonstrate its ability."
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to the mansion training next week after his brain protection.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player is going to start training.
Okotie was injured in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) at a heavy assembly hall on the head.
However, despite his initial fears, he remained without a heavy burden.
No diet - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his dirty line, he will often be cut off from them.
Because Mangos contain relatively much sugar - mainly sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: B-vitamin and vitamin E and C. In them, Mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its premixture beta-carotine.
Therefore, those who eat the fruit support vision, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or tight and taste pleasant.
The skin color alone doesn't tell you how rich the fruit is - so green mangos can taste very sweet too.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste, of course, pure or sweet food.
However, a mango also has a special note in court.
It smells the light biter taste of some leaves salts such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney is good for fish, birds, lamb and wild.
The U.S. Packaging Service UPS reimburses up to 95000 outlets for Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, with UPS sharing on Tuesday.

In view of the treeing online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been dealing with earlier years to be armed for Christmas business.
late delivery in 2013 has brought the package services to a low level of criticism.
First spring, then marked Kaltfront
On the following night, the speaker of the Alpennorth page of the song, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
In the middle of the night and in the night of the dinner, the ears partially burst with strength through the ears.
After the dawn of Thursday morning, we are surrounded by a marked cold front that brings powerful rainfalls, wind bubbles and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a message, Switzerland is currently on the front of a vast area of deep pressure over the British islands in a strong southwestern stream.
On the side of the Alpennord, he spends the night in the middle of the village by the tenter.
As a result, the Führer to Donnermorgührer is located in the Führertällen with 60 to 100 km/h, individually and specifically in Urnerland with more than 100 km/h.
The foot can move to the adjacent middle of the mountain, and even at the mountains it is possible to reach an Orkan bay of more than 120 km/h.
While in the north on the midweek of sturmic foot for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, moisture begins to rise on the Alps.
Here's a line that belongs to Donnerstagend.
In sum, the Alps must be calculated in the next 48 hours, partly over 100 litres per square metre, which have already fallen in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the Führer takes off the air, resulting in a cold front with a strong, partially heavy-pressed rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the coldfront, the wind cools up until storming, and the temperatures go back clearly.
The following days are usually presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, and in the south it will be more sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, an unnamed place in the park on the oppio hill was baptized on behalf of the German Reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now known as "German Theology of Reform".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome along the Colosseum.
The name was applied by the working community of the Evangelical Church in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes over the centuries were often able to live as a minority only in those who had hidden their faith.
With the place, it will be symbolically seen that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stood in Rome as a young Augustian monk for the 1510/11 season.
He then received the city as a coming sin bible.
His negative impressions must have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome, in the eyes of historians.
Luther had then introduced the sect of the Western Church with his essays against the sale of abortion.
Hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus is one of the main works of Otmar Alt for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At first, was the word?
No, not in the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now appeared with beautiful images.
At first, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who formulated his entire personal interpretation of Bible stories on paper and legend in 150 motives.
His "language" with beautiful colors and fantastic shapes has been received by the 75-year-olds - but nothing is equally significant with "future" images.
On the contrary: Adjusting each theme can make it more effective.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he met a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the "books of All Books".
Disappearances are cycles that refer to such topics as cross-section, plates, bids or baths.
In this way, he also fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther version with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler version with its focus on the works of art.
And above all, it is the author of Klaus Altepost, who has established himself on the basis of the painting with the respective Bible texts.
He interpreted the Bible texts chosen by Otmar Alt and thus into today, in modern contexts, "translated".
These texts are like fairy tales of Alts painting.
They are built between Martin Luther's original Bible quote and a set of artists, who form his entire personal thoughts here for each situation.
The fancy band has gold letters.
So the 75-year-old also doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of privacy.
Finally, emotions were finally resolved for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerede in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant masters' orders.
"The education has already happened with the Rohrstock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've tried to work it out so that maybe I'll be with the Father again."
It is his second case to help art in more fast-lived times to add value: "The reality of the worlds is today driven by advertising, and it is loud.
It's going to be forced down there.
Artists have another fun and good to show things.
Images always have something secret and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into the picture", to discover, discover and explore what power they have: "The image is looking for against."
Klaus Altepost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation, "always" being a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he feels about his life with his pictures."
Not only has the Bible been fully understood but it has also been chosen for its important, secretive subjects.
"This was no cooperation on eye height," said Altepost: "It's about the images that explain the text only." It was a Bible.
For Hans Möhler from the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "to deepen his life and to find freedom".
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the (Bible) language of love and the responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and ink wall images - is first presented in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX train
Planned, found place, commissioned companies, modeled rentals for a round course: a year later, almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX train was closed.
Political and administrative pollution caused disturbances, especially in the people who did not want to stop the train.
So rent the hill, looking for a new place - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
The approval will be entered in October, the first Community member of the Sabine Mosbach Book could now be notified to the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started without "more meditation" with the work at the former hall.
DFB intensified commitment for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, which the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend.
The football reacts to the expected situation in Germany and the policy ensures its help in dealing with the ongoing problems.
"I hold this for the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"No one can say, in principle, that's not going to happen to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be of interest to each individual to get this topic in the Griff," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wishes to address the refugee situation in Germany.
"I'm the next Wednesday in the Chancellor and meet the Prime Minister, Mrs Özojjz and the Chancellor."
"That will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and will help.
However, the key factors must be the policy.
The German football band has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"On the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," Niersbach said at the end of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federalists also support this program.
Already this week, the 36 profiverines set a significant sign when they are placed on the left tricotorum instead of the other common sponsorenologist (hermes) the expression "We help - #refugeeswelme".
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkussen Sport Chief Rudi Völler of the "Image" Zeitung (Dinsday) and described the project as "self-conscious".
"This refugee drama is about everyone, no one can see it."
"We can football clubs, no, we need to use our power, influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbelievably," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffpenheim's business leader Peter rightly spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
For the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday, the National Mission of Women invites 100 refugees to Hall/Sale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
That all 36 licensees in their places have started their own projects is great.
It's so great that smaller and smaller units are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, will live in football.
"This is of immense importance," he said.
In this year and next year, the association with the DFB election and the federal government will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The Unions have already removed all the sums for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Chief lost an eye when an accident occurred
The head of Europe's largest software companies, Bill McDermott, has subsequently lost the left eye through a storm in early July.
In the case of the accident at the foot of his brother's house in the United States, after midnight he fell onto a water glass that he had carried in his left hand, he reported the "economic week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bloated, he's been powerless, he's gone out on the street - that's what he told us last week," says the "WiWo" SAP-based Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could follow his work.
"In the beginning of October, we will meet before the meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager will be at the meeting and "full-time".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "South German newspaper" (donnersage issue), he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software companies.
"I'm full of SAP there, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Board of Supervisors and its President Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott is obviously between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go to the public with such a personal history, the manager of the "SZ" said, "Everyone can do something like that."
"It's important to get up again when you fall."
McLaren-Erastzpilot Magnussen with no fat ...
Magnussen tweeted an appropriate photo and explained that he had suffered the damage when he was hit by the wheel.
Therefore, on the weekend in Singapore, it is also less than a reservation for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, like a week later at the large price of Japan.
Football: BVB without rouss against Krasnodar: Weidenfaller in the Tower
At Borusia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus have finally been raised in the first group of Europe League.
The national player will also miss the football club leader in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 p.m./Sky).
"We can't go back to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be there again on Sunday at the Bundesliga Summit against Liverkusen, the BVB-Coach opened: "We expect him to return to training on Friday."
In view of the high load of his professional, Tuchel will not only change his stem to the reus position.
So he announced a change in the tour position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes over the place of the tribekeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weidenfaller will be used in all European League games in the future, however, Tuchel was open.
With high probability, he will also fight the second party.
The research statement by Player Reus that the final input for the BVB in Europe League should be the goal, media player Julian Weigl says: "This is why Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take off the title."
Robots: Government wants a preliminary role for Germany
Germany should be responsible for the purpose of the Federal Government at the turn of the car's technological priorities.
The Federal Bureau decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the border of the IAA Automese of a "new mobility-timer".
The automated and networked vehicles will increase traffic safety and provide for fewer stops, Dobindt said.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 states, who also come together with representatives of the industry on the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and an increasing shift to digital hearing.
In order to test new technology, there is now a test route on the 9th highway in Bayern.
In order to ensure that the driver is "no additional liability risk" the Federal Government will "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
In this way, Germany wants to use approximately internationally to increase the allowable maximum speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers.
In addition, the Federal Government wants to apply itself to a change to the Vienna Convention, which is only intended for people as drivers.
In the case of automated vehicles, the driver will take more and more driving to the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that detect the environment and process data in seconds.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automatic vehicles will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, unmanned vehicles on public roads have been "expected from 2020".
The creation of value in the field of driver assistance systems and high-automatic driving functions in Germany is estimated by the authors of the 2025 study at around €8.4 billion.
"The digital connection of the Pkws can lead to more security and efficiency in road transport," said Sören Bartol, the SPD transport policy.
However, the issue of liability in cases and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clarified clearly.
However, the German cars themselves are still skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on the AA on Wednesday in the order of the Dekra audit organisation results in that only eight percent of the Germans believe that self-employed cars will be sold in the next ten years, 32 percent will only be counted in 20 years, so 31 percent will not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of the respondents between 2025 and 2025 are auto-run cars, 33 percent in the United States.
In addition, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave entirely on a self-propelled vehicle.
After a collection of the Bitkom digital bond, only seven per cent would agree to give control over all roads throughout the road.
On the highway, it could always represent 15 per cent in the floating traffic, 45 per cent in the station.
All right, every quarter would leave the car control under no circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table EM
The Düsseldorfer is currently seeking to record only in its own unit from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall expire on 22 September.
"This is a loss of rice for our team."
"The boys have learned it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough, even without Timo to hold the title," said Federal Strainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Bull is currently on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsoring term in China.
The 34-year-old German master will be back on Friday.
"Without Timo it is the night part, we are no longer such a clear favorite," said single European mayor Dimitry Ovcharov.
The Hamelner, who conducted the list in Jekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 EM in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing, and we have become European masters."
"We should focus on this," said the World Wide List Five.
The English football national player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has brought a serious injury to the right leg.
During the champions-League game at the PSV Endhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long-term treatment.
The first diagnosis showed that at the age of 20 players from Bastian Swweinsteger pointed to a stroke.
Gautier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a blend of all the great fashions and a growth-grass-grass-cat: the designer Jean Paul Gautier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The heights: Shoes of lightning pumps, thanks to video projections that are disturbingly human.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, inter alia, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonnas Bühnenoft - and so that he joined men in Röcke.
"I can't say today that I'm the son of a bitch, because I know her."
"Before it was left, it's true," said Gautier.
For visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the Civil Building on the Road), which is to be seen in the cultural hall of the Hippo Culture Foundation on September 18th, it is a joy that the fashion designer has at first changed his negative attitude to a look at his person.
In fact, he had been against it because, "I hear an exhibition a little after death," he said.
If you die, you come into the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Dieteren.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the almost invisible work of the man who wrote the fashion story without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the mirror is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed overall works, for which a lot of excitement has been done: To refresh the lungs, for example, a stylist has been engaged in itself.
14 tons of material have been carded by the makers according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was another special nightmare: a leatherhosen outfit with corset.
Heidi's the daughter of Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are stronger than men") and for people who are slightly different, Gautier said.
Also Gaultier's old Teddy is to be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, highly developed fashionable complexion of the designer.
As a child (he wasn't a good student and bad in football) he took his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gautier.
To play with a pump, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion later he joined himself.
He stopped fashion magazines and saw the design of other designers, as Gautier told in Munich.
But then I bought it, of course.
For his first own fashion view, he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they couldn't keep the clamotes.
Beautiful instead of Gardene - Player Spitze as fashion-Nische
Earlier it went to the long stick machines and to make planes to make meters.
The covered materials and chips were produced in large quantities for customers, for example, who continued to process coverings and gardens.
This alone is not working today anymore, explains Andreas Reinhardt, manager of fashionspice plauen.
Instead, the fashion is again important.
In the early days of the Plainer Spitze, fashion played a greater role, then was forced by the domestic textile industry - and now it is re-discovered as a Nessie.
Reinhardt cites some examples: Spitze in beautiful, with accessories such as bags and regional tracts.
Above all, the so-called Vintage mode, which is based on past styles, represents an increasing potential for command.
Anyone who does not apply for anything in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
They are already making out half of all the orders.
Modespitze Plauen together with nine other companies is a member of the company's association with Plauner Spitze and Stickerie.
Only they can carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of the turnover has been broken.
Private businesses and the wholesale trade are almost gone.
Our products are not yet able to reach customers in this way.
Today the massware will be produced much cheaper in the Asian area and almost exclusively distributed over chains.
In addition, exports to Russia and the United States are weak.
So there are reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point out environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein states: "Since this year we have led a quality cycle that shows that we produce organic and socially.
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used."
Diplomdesigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeeberg University of West Sächsächsäle Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in drawings and fittings.
To counter competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension field between the latest ideas of designers and the companies that need to think, especially economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design will often vary easily only to keep a customer name.
A few years ago, Textile Designer Kati Reuter lived the historical snowflakes again.
The machine is attached to some places with small angles.
The Plainer Goldsmith Master Bianca Hallebach-Kruße was inspired to say: "I couldn't start anything with traditional Plainer Spitze".
Now she uses the snowball chips for her beauty.
In an ongoing process, she presents the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plainer Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It is also available in the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in and around the world and who want a piece of memory.
That's why I see my beauty as a modern messenger of the Plainer Spitze.
Disney plants a new "Mary Poppins" film
Falsely you shouldn't get in, but Disney waits for a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, it's called "Intertainment Weekly" not about a re-film, but about a kind of follow-up that goes on 20 years after the first film with the magic child-feeding.
It is about the experience of Nanny with the Banks family during the world economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already determined: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi insists on opening the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open up more and more to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on the Tuesday of a group that was tasked with linking the reform.
"China should use it to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business-based strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the extension of a comprehensive reform.
To promote innovation and promote reforms will create new momentum and vitality and provide a new place for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access arrangements, border controls policy relaxation, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and maintenance of the housing system.
A negative list will be drawn up after the statute, identifying sectors and companies that are not involved in investment.
The system will be tested and tested and improved by test programmes.
The initiative is important because it attaches a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal area of business and draws up the market more openly.
The government will also close controls on the powers conferred on undertakings and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The Statute also said that border areas China will be allowed to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Under an offer to open publicly controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy against foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," the state said.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to use professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
At the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders, such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, also took part, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the Quecksilber limit value in raw fish
The European Commission wants to double the thresholds for mercury in large raw fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of kidney fat.
The Food Addiction Organisation, which has a corresponding EU working paper, criticised the plan, "The risks and side effects of corrupt industrial and environmental policies will continue with full expectation to be addressed to pregnant and young children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Fodwatch.
Wolfschmidt is therefore expected to raise the thresholds for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as hai or heavy fish from "economic policy reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large raw fish have already been so heavily charged with mercury that on the basis of the still applicable limit values, about 50 percent of the prisoners cannot be sold.
After doubleing the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be sold.
In contrast to this lockdown, the EU calls feedwatch to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called it "trick", because smaller peaceful fish, such as carpfens, are often so low that they already contain the planned maximum values today.
The decline in small fish is therefore "a perfect balance of manoeuvre, which only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Quecksilber is a high-quality heavy metal for humans, which is strongly enough over the food chain, especially in raw fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "a very small amount of damage to the nervous system can be caused, especially in the case of newborns."
The Federal Ministry of Environment, however, states on its website, in view of the current highest values, that there is no "health risk for the general population" to be expected.
Quecksilber is primarily achieved by carbon combustion in the environment.
The German coal power plants, according to a written departure from the Federal Ministry of Environment to the Green Bundestag's official Annalena Baerbock, drew more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total emissions in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish about Elbe, Rhein and Donau was "long and flattened", the "spiegel" quoted in the March issue of the paper.
In the past year, European alerts to mercury in fish have already been identified as the most commonly reported health risks in the EU alerting system RASFF.
