All Members are worried that they're going to be mixed with the "mavets"
Some Members expressed their concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of Parliament of Italy).
This concern was caused by plans to change the name of the Assembly of Parliament of Italy.
Members throughout the political phase are concerned that something like this will be heard aloud.
A member of the Working Party said his extension was concerned that he would "do the same thing with the words Twp and Pwp".
For celebrities other than Italy: In general, the word "twp" means "hash" and the word "pwp" means "pwp".
One member of the Plaids said that the extension was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
One observer stated that his own extension was "inhuman" about the change of name, but noted that the word MWP does not derive much from the word "mapet".
In this context, the verb w is presented in the same way as the English sentence of Jürksair of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Commission, which is currently drawing up the draft legislation on the establishment of the change in the name, stated: "The final decision on any name to which Members will be called will be a case of the Members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Italy of 2017 granted the Parliament of Italy the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals which were widely accepted for the name of the House as Parliament of Italy.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission was named "Member of Parliament of Italy" or WMP, but the election of MWP was the result of greater support in the public consultation.
Members clearly propose alternative options, but the attempt to achieve consensus may be a difficult case for Parliament's President, Eleni Jones, who is expected to submit the bill for the change of name within the next few weeks.
The Law on Amendments will also include other changes in the functioning of the Council, among other rules of withdrawal from the Member State and the design of the committee system.
Members will decide on the final vote on the issue of their name during the debate on legislation.
The citizens of GDP are added to the resolution on the change in the country's name
The voters will vote on the change in the country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The people's vote was called for in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its north-east-east-eastered area is undermining territorial views and has repeatedly been opposed to its requests for EU and NATO entry into force.
Güorge Ivanof, President of the DPRK, a war in the resolution on the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the resolution, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaef, claim that the change is simply the price they have to pay for their EU and NATO integration.
St. Martin's camps have survived as the congregations in Harlem disappear
"People older than I talked to, say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is none of the two."
He said he understood the reason the bars disappeared.
"The world is socialized differently today," he said.
"The bar is no longer the salon of the neighborhood where the world regularly goes."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not remain as long as the officials hope "and soon or soon they will return to the point where they started".
The congregations, he added, can be replaced by multi-residents with people who will not be willing to help the lands of refuge that have remained in the neighborhood.
"The composite majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus they will arrive on the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people will move to these apartments to become members of the churches."
And the two churches were built by white churches before the Harlem Mother of the Blacks - the Metropolitical Community was founded in 1870, Saint Martin a decade later.
The early Methodist Church disappeared in the 1930 ’ s.
A black church located in a nearby distance took possession of the building.
The holding of St. Martin's building took a black church under the edification of John Howard Johnson, who led to the massacre of the 125th Street stations, a basic commercial road in Harlem, which refused to follow or give rise to blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson’s entrants took the reconstruction and burned the garage.
Professor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's church, called the Queen "the Camps of the Poor."
The specialist who loved the Virgin of July described it differently: "political treasure" and "an anti-historical historical instrument".
Specialist Tiffany In of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first career in the world played by black music, by Dennisio A. Lind, who was transferred to the largest career in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merigueder said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
What happens in the last few months in St. Martin is a long story between architects and workers, some of whom were invited by the local church leaders, while others from the visit.
The perpetrators - the administrative body of the province, which is made up of local leaders - sent to visit July a letter of concern that the visit "would have made it possible to transfer the cost" to the board of directors, despite the fact that this had no interest in the reception of the leaders and workers sent by the church.
Some entrants expressed regret over the lack of transparency on the part of the audience.
A 13-year-old dog riding for birds in California
Carcaria was attacked and wounded 13-year-olds on the Sabbath during a hunting season in California on the first day of the summer, according to the authorities.
The attack was mentioned just before the 7th century B.C.E. near the Bison Beach in the city of Enzinita.
Chad Hamel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had spent some half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the children's cries for help and approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a little bit of excitement because he was in trouble, but then he realized he was crying, "Something touched me!
Something touched me!"
All the key was open," Hamel observed when he arrived at the place where the boy was.
"I called everybody out of the water, 'There's cancer in the sea!' added Hamel.
The boy was transferred by air to the Paedia Randy Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
The type of cancer responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Navigator Larry Jails said in the paper that the cancer had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Jail added that the victim brings serious damage to the top of the hill.
The authorities prohibited access to the beach from the Pontó bis to the Casabland to the Suamis in Enzinitas for 48 hours for reasons of research and security.
Joels noted that there are more than 135 species of carcinoma in the region, but most are not considered to be dangerous.
Saninsbury's projects impose pressure on the U.S. consumer product market
The Sanisbury's are measured by the Boats, Superdrug and Debenhams, placing branches of accults compared with these multi-systems, equipped with special staff.
In the context of the significant decline in the EU customer market of 2.8 tonnes, which continues to develop while sales of inputs and household species indicate a fall, the largest customer branches will be tested in 11 systems throughout the country and will be deployed in more cases if the business fails.
The investment in the customer sector comes as the supermarkets seek to fill the area in branches that have ever included televisions, small-scale ovens and household items.
The Sainsbury's said they would double their customer offer to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space with leaves with the company's logo, similar to those of the boats.
The Supermarket is re-launching its Boutique makeup series so that most products are vegan - something that requires more and more younger consumers.
In addition, the Romanian company The Fragrance Shop will try to have its products available in two Saninsbury's, the one that opened in Creedon, South London, the previous week and the other in Shelly Oak, in Bermichham, later this year.
Electronic markets and the trend of the market for small quantities of food daily in the local market mines mean that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Kup, director of the Sansbury's council, said that the outlet systems will be more and more similar to the multi-systems, as the supermarettes are trying to compete with the output systems Aldi and Lidl with more services than food.
The Sainsbury's put outlets out of Argos in hundreds of cases, and they also introduced some Habitats as they bought the two olives two years ago, a fact that supported sales of pancakes and placed more attractive exports.
The previous attempt of Supermarette to re-examine the sections of the culinary and medicinal product failed.
The Sansbury'ss tested a joint deal with the Boots at the beginning of the year 2000, but the cooperation ended after an intervention on how to distribute the profits from the drug systems in the supermarkets of the aluminium.
The new strategy was designed after Sansbury's sold the company of medicines that you had with 281 cases in Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, about €125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play his own role in the project, adding an enlarged range of multi-stakeholder companies, among others La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four situations.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the trade director of Sansbury's, said: "We transformed the appearance and feel of our raffles to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in a highly trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our company's phase has been designed to cover every need, while the smooth environment and the comfortable locations mean that we are another possible destination for customers who doubt the traditional market method."
Peter Jones: late after Holly Willowby's release from the 11 million £ agreement
The contractor of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is exhausted after the removal of Holly Willobie's television network from the 11 million £ agreement with the company of lifestyle that it has, in order to withdraw from the new contracts with Marks and Spencer and the ITV.
Willobi has no time for the company of type-in and designer Truly.
Their business was similar to Goop's company in Guineth Paltrow.
The 37-hour presentation of the "This Morning" issue announced in Instagram her decision to quit.
Holly Willobie has made an exception to the president of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving the company alivestyle for the last time, in order to withdraw from its new great agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became exorbitant when the gold girl of the television was accepted during a full session of the Third in the central offices of his autonomy in Marlo, Bakihamsair, that because of the new ones of the agreements - up to £1.5 million - it would not have been long enough to be available to the company of type-extinguishing and non-industrial Truly.
The company was similar to Goop's Goop of Guineth Paltrous and seems to have doubled the property of Wiilobi, which is estimated to reach £11 million.
After the 37-year-old Willobi's announcement in Instagram that he is going to leave Truly, Jones landed outside of Britain in some of his excellent homes.
According to some source: "Truly was far from Holly Willobie's top priorities.
This is for her long-term future, the source of her revenue for the next decade.
Her decision to give up was an exception to all those involved in the undertaking.
No one could believe what happened on the Third, so close to the presentation.
There is a stock of products in the Central Offices in Marlou ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" exhibition, which is compiled among the most commercial features of Britain, could cost millions to the company due to the extensive investment in products from furniture and leather to clothing and household items, as well as further delays in its presence.
And that can mark the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willobie, mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband maintain close friendship with Jones and Tara Cap's husband for ten years here.
Willoby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the President of March.
Marriages go through with his breaks, and Jones maintains a share of 40 percent in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willobi is about to become the main person in the M&S camps and to replace And McPartlin in the presentation of I'm A Celebrity at the ITV.
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We wouldn't want to talk about his professional affairs."
We were tough "and then we fell in love"
He was concerned about the criticism received by the media for a comment that some would consider it inappropriate for a president, as well as for his stand against the leader of North Korea.
For what reason did President Trab make so many grants?
Trab said the TV player's voice was silenced.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trab as a major step towards the withdrawal of North Korea.
However, negotiations for decommissioning have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ray Young-Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "response" response from the US after North Korea's first deployment.
On the contrary, he stressed that the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at bringing pressure.
Trab kept a much more favorable position in his speech.
"We're going very well with North Korea," he said.
"It's nice to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have their lives.
We have now built this extraordinary relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim gave positive results - the end of the fire tests, the release of the numbers and return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
While he supported his unfathomable stand in his statements on his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a "presidential" floor, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the hall because they couldn't come in, we would have only 200 people here," Trab said, showing the crowd before him.
A tsunami and tsunami in Indonesia devours a whole island, leaving thousands of dead in their path.
For example, in the capital of Lobok, it was announced that the assistance of foreign non-governmental organizations would not be necessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of Lobok's population was found, there was no national disaster, a necessary condition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is very difficult," said Mr. Subung.
While the Save the Children organization is preparing a group that will travel to Paul, it is not yet known whether the foreign staff can work on site.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Natural Disasters Service, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Paul to determine whether it would allow international organizations to contribute assistance.
As a result of the seismic donations that often plague Indonesia, the country remains extremely unprepared against the age of nature.
While they have been built for tsunamis in Athens, the same is not happening in other platforms.
The apparent lack of a series of warnings for tsunamis in Paul, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of such lives.
In the best case, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters cover even more administrative times.
A large hospital that had set up in Lobok to capture the victims of the plague leads to Paul, but they will need at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Windonto was at the centre of the campaign's election to improve the built-in structures of Indonesia and provided a simple budget for the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding is the result of the administration of Mr Joe, before the re-election next year.
Mr. Joe also receives pressure from the double-faced facial trends in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives, and tens of thousands were found as groups of Christians and Muslims fighting on the streets, using swords, toxins and arrows, as well as other self - designed weapons.
Follow me: Daniel Stedge of Liverpool is against Chelsea
Daniel Stedge saved Liverpool from a storm at the Premier League against Chelsea with a ball in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stedge was accepted by Serdan Shakyri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's term with his group to lose 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and hit the back door.
His efforts were directed very high from the big area and ended up right up on the networks.
The ball finally fell over the head of the Arizabalaga, which came up to pull her off and went into the net.
"I was trying to take this position, get to the ball and players like Sakiri always play as much as possible in front, so I tried to win as much as possible for as long as possible," Steridge said in LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Candy get close, I made a direct change, I didn't think so much and I did the sweat."
Chelsea had a 1-0 preview in the afternoon after the ice in the 25th minute from Belgrade's Star, Ende Azar.
The blue captivator gave me a ride to Mother Kovatsic in this game, before giving him a shower close to the center of the ground and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kowatsicht did two in the center of the ground.
Then, he gave a lot of old-fashioned sheep, leading Ezra to the great area.
Azar fell out of front of the army and finished sending the ball to the back of the docary with a left sat in front of Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will compete against Napoli at the Campions League's talks on Wednesday in Stanio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will deal with Videton at UEFA Europe League on Friday in London on 3 p.m.
The tragic count of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia falls to 832
The calculation of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the declarations of the country’s natural disasters, early in the summer.
Many people were trapped in the walls of the buildings that were destroyed after the 7.5 levels that closed the Paris area and created a 6-metre hole, said the service representative, Sutopo Puuroo Nugrocho, at a type conference.
The city of Paul, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the buildings they destroyed.
The police took 32 years, apparently, after the murder of a woman with a sword.
A murder investigation began after a woman discovered the body in Birchengent, in Merseysaint this morning.
The 44th was found in 7.55 B.C.E. with injuries from attacks at the Grayson Mouse in John Strit, while a 32 - year - old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police asked the district where they saw or heard something to put it in the police.
Police officer Brian Oheygan said: "The investigation is at an initial stage, but I would like to address anyone who was in the neighborhood around John Strit and saw or heard something strange to communicate with us.
I would also like to address an invitation to anyone, especially on the travel guides, who may have written something on the plans from the dashcam cameras to communicate with us as they can have the information that is vital to our research."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birchengent and found in a building.
Today's evening friends who believe that they can know the woman went to the crime scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
The research is in progress as the police indicated that it is in the process of informing relatives.
A travel guide who lives in Grayson Muose, in his attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He remained silent when he found out what happened.
The owners were informed that they may need to spend hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A policeman is brought to tell a man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up in a chair.
They kept saying "it's cold."
At 2 p.m., the police were inside the police court and one outside.
The police were standing outside the hall and watching the crowd.
Any information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 for case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's gospel in Parliament becomes the last monument to be celebrated by the philonical for the "recovery of history"
His extremism would be a fundamental right for the Taliban to destroy many of England's cultural and religious projects by his fanatic four-year-old supporters.
However, Syllogos Cromwell described Mr Crick's proposal as "annoia" and "an attempt to restore history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Council, said: "In this debate on the removal of the goods, it was essential that Oliver Cromwell's form not be indicated outside of the Doctors of Westminster.
The economics of England's foreign wars were neither banned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong member of Cromwell’s family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas’s predecessor in the past century.
The excellent conversion of Cromwell by Ser William Hamo Thornicroft is a feature of the 19th century's image and part of the history of a personality that many believe is worth a price tax.
Mr. Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century in relation to today, as a deputy of the House against external pressures, in his case, of course, mononarism.
The fact that this is a very precise case is the subject of an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a recognized personality that represents one side of the rule.
His achievements as Lord Priest are also valuable and memorable."
Hoiros-killer hurts a deadly Chinese farm
A farmer was attacked and killed by a thief on the market in South-East China, according to local news reports.
The man, who was only known as "Waan", was found with a broken artery in a blood stream near the Liupanswei market in the province of Guítsou, in South China, reported Morning Post to the Syrian.
A member of a group is prepared to make vaccines in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Zing in the Chinese province of China, China.
He must have traveled with his brother from nearby June on Wednesday to sell 15 people on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and discovered the door of a neighbor’s apartment.
He said there was a huge arsenic noise in his mouth.
The judge's examination confirmed that the male who was married to 227 kilos had killed the farmer, according to his report.
"My brother's feet were dead and broken," said the brother, known as "Wow," according to the Gwijiang's night news department.
The security cameras show Wian to enter the market at 4:40 p.m. on Friday to watch the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Owen or his brother.
A market official announced in the night news report that the thief has been placed in clubs to avoid being attacked by anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene of the attack.
Wean's family and the market authorities are brought to negotiate some compensation for his death.
Although often, cases of rape in humans have also been recorded in the past.
In 2016 a thief attacked a woman and her husband in their garden in Masahuaseta, seriously harming the man.
Ten years ago, a thousand 295 miles [295 km] ago, a farmer in Italy stopped a farmer on his tractor, where the farmer’s wife turned the animal away.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was kidnapped by the pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba said to the CBC News that the pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "noose".
"They just have a game layout.
They're small, very strange plastics... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them proper respect," he said.
Rosa's remains are going to bring extensive floods in the South America
According to the estimates, typhoid Rosa is suffering as it moves over the coldest water masses of the northern regions of Mexico.
However, Typhoon Roza will bring cyclones to North Mexico and South America in the coming days.
The force of the Roza fountain was reached at 85 mph, being Category 1, at 5 B.C.E., the sun and found 385 millimetres of the fifth century in Mexico.
Lieutenant Rosa is expected to move north to the Lord.
In the meantime, a low-pressure area of the rivers has begun to be formed over the Northern Ocean and moved east to the West Coast of the United States. As the Pacific is approaching South California's hieroglyphics on Monday, a tropical spring will bring a tropical flurry to the north of the South America.
The Roza storm will bring peaks of 25 per cent in the areas of Mexico Monday.
Then, tropical moisture in combination with the region of low respiratory stress that is approaching will create extensive strong floods in the South in the coming days.
Local, peaks of 2.5 to 10 per cent will result in dangerous floods, hurricanes and possibly flooding.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to pollutant rates approaching 5 to 7.5 per cent of the time in the area, especially in parts of the South Nevada and Arizona.
A high level of 5 to 10 percent is expected locally in the South-East, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Plums are likely to cause serious damage to the sights due to the different nature of the mucous membranes.
It is recommended that you avoid any movement with your feet in the chest in view of the threat of a fatal accident.
Strong winds can transform the ponds into cormorant waters and the streams will cause local winds and ammo.
The low-pressure area will create some local powerful explosions in places in South California.
A total peak of over 1 per cent is likely, which can cause small flows of distortions and totality on the roads.
This will be the first occurrence of the summer season in the region.
Some divergent tropical storms will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday mornings, before the sights spread late Monday and Tuesday.
Strong landings will take place in For Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Tuesday.
In October, there will be a number of intense changes in temperature across the United States as temperatures in Arctic are rising, but the tropical zones remain quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very intense changes in temperature in nearby areas.
A characteristic example of the intense temperature differences between the Central American countries was observed in Chile.
It noted a difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and the Army, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moin, Iowa.
In the next days, constant high temperatures will be observed and resuscitated.
In most of the Central and Eastern America, October is expected to start with high temperatures at 27 °C from the Eastern areas to parts of the South-East.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast, there are many possibilities to observe temperatures above average in the United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million televisors were watching Brit Kavano's hearing
More than 20 million televisors were watching the motion for an appeal for the Supreme Court of the United States of America for Brett Kavanno, Friday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which occurred in the 1980s, Kristin Blazi Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, political exclusion continued, with the television networks to halt the normal flow of the program for the last time in Paris: the agreement by the Commissioner of Arizona Jeff Flick on conducting a week of FBI research in relation to the categories.
Ford told the Justice Commission of Georgia that it is 100 percent sure of how in a party when Kavano was a student of law she was attacked while she was pregnant and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanno, in a charged statement, stated that it is 100 percent sure that something did not happen.
According to Nielsen's estimates, it is possible that more than 20.4 million televisors were watching the hearing on Friday.
The company submitted the average television on the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted the audience, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
At the same time, Nielsen is often difficult to calculate the number of television providers watching a transfer from office areas.
To see this television in the right locations, it is a common proportion of what is followed by a football game or the final name of the Oskar bears.
The Fox News channel, in which the journalists strongly supported the appointment of Cabano, was launched with an average of 5.69 million televisors during the entire day of hearing, according to Nielsen.
Second, ABC is located with 3,26 million televisors.
CBS was followed by 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Fleck was shown as a competitor in the Parsche.
Following the statement by the Republican meteorologist that he would vote in favour of Cabano, the CNN and CBS cameras signed the Friday morning to test him as he tried to enter the consulate for hearing by the Justice Commission of Georgia.
He stood with the look down for a few minutes as he was shot, lived on the CNN TV.
"I'm standing here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are weak."
Fleck said that his office had made statements and, before closing his elevator doors, he would have said more to the Commission's hearing.
All cable television and transmission networks were closed a few hours later, the vote of the Justice Commission of Georgia on the promotion of Cabano's independence to the whole of Georgia to vote.
However, Felix said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the vote the following week, which was requested by the minority of the republics.
Flyk was sent in part after talks with his friend, State Department Officer Chris Konces.
After discussions with Küns and some other Georgians, Fleik decided.
Fleck's election was valid, because it was apparent that the Republicans would not concentrate on the votes for the approval of Cabano without conducting an investigation.
President Trab asked the FBI to carry out an investigation on the allegations against Cabano.
British Prime Minister May accuses its critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa Mei accused the supporters of the European Union's eviction plans that they "play political games" with Britain's future and claim national interest in a meeting with the newspaper Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Tereza May arrives for the Conference of the Conciliation Party in Berlin, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another meeting with her own in the newspaper's preamble, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is critical of the Czechs project for Brexit, saying that the proposal to impose duties between Britain and the EU was "completely dangerous".
Fireball Wyatt Sims: The police took Captain Dadeon Simson for the murder of the player in LSU
The police took a look at the death bombing of White Sims, a 20-year-old LSU's basketball team player.
Dean Simson, 20 years old, was arrested and kept in jail with a second-level murder category according to the police department of Baton Rouz.
The authorities have in their hands a video from Sims' completion with Simson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the checkout.
The police located the glasses in the crime scene and said they found a sign from Simson's DNA, according to the WAFB working with the CBS.
After Samson's rebuff, the police declared he admitted that he had killed White.
His insurance was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by Dr. Baton Rouss who circulated Paris, death is the plague of snakes in the head and neck.
The Ministry appointed a special working group, the police station, the police forces of the South University and the citizens of the region to assist in the collection investigation.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for "confidential investigation and enforcement of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The Foreword rose to 1,98 feet, where his father, Wayne, also played LSU's basketball.
It had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match for the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU White's team's coach said the team was "confirmed" and "in shock situation" since Weind's death.
"We're always worried about things like this," said White.
Emissions of abstinence in the City of Mexico
The exhibitions of the Afástic Tree from the Popokatépetl River reached the southern vicinity of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned the inhabitants of Mexico to stay away from the harbor, after the activity in the camp reached its peak, with 183 emissions of water and grass within 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring various indications and small seismic donations.
Images in social networking show a preview of cars covered with a minute of grass in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Sotsimilko.
The geothermals observed an increase in the activity of the bridge located at 45 miles (72 km) east of the original at the time of a 7.1 ridge in central Mexico in September 2017.
The flag, known as Don Gogo, has been active since 1994.
Police forces are brought together with Catalan self-employed in view of the scope of the vote for independence
Six people were gathered in Barcelona on Saturday after a conflict of protest against independence with the re-establishment units of the class, as thousands participated in the declarations for the first half of the vote on the reunification of the Catalans that had proclaimed the city.
A group of masked exhibitors for independence, which were accompanied by the restoration units of the class, threw eggs and pigs into the skin, creating snowy snowy snow in the streets that are usually covered by tourists.
Groups were also noted later during the day with the police to use their clubs to create the complexes.
For hours, groups of supporters of the independence of Catalan called the phrase "We're not sorry, we don't forget" against groups of demonstrators for the unity of the country they called "I'm looking for Spain".
Forty people were observed with microtraumatics marked during the demonstrations, according to the local type.
The attacks remain high in the region that supports independence one year after the declaration of the October 1 issue as an illegal by Madrid, however, which is inherited by the autonomous Catalans.
The majority of voters chose independence, even though the approach was low with those who stand against independence to embody the resolution.
According to the Catholic authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at the electoral centres in the area where violent complications were mentioned.
Groups in favour of independence have set up a ban on Paris in order to prevent a demonstration of support for national police.
The event was carried out on other occasions, and it was necessary to take a different change.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in demonstrations for his wife’s independence, said that he had no hope of winning her independence.
"We used to live one of our brightest moments.
I saw my parents with great joy that they were about to vote, but now the situation is stable," he said.
Despite the fact that they pointed out a vital victory even if limited to regional elections last December, the Catalan parties for independence were fighting to maintain their strong footing, with many of their most prominent leaders being self-dedicated or held in custody, as their right to their role in the organization of the resolution and the resulting declaration of independence.
John Puts, a 42-year-old mechanic, who wrote with his cell phone the statements for the police, said the conflicts were fed by both political and military forces.
"The intensity is getting worse and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were detained last year, announced his appeal to the European Elections for the coming year.
"My appeal to the European elections is the best way to complain about the suspension of democratic values and the pressure we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
London: Collection of men after car hire in a home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were gathered after repeated car promotions in a home in London.
The incident was held in Bolinggard Cresent on Friday about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blamings said damage was caused on the floor and on the same building.
It may also have been noticed by someone in the car for a while.
Mengka's press won in Livington won 1-0 against the Reinzers.
Dolly Mengka's first golfer for Livington guaranteed victory.
The lead-in-law of Livington caught up with the Rangers enjoying Steven Gerard's second bet in 18 games as the manager of the Imbrogs team.
Dolly Mengka's print made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed the level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains unbeatable outside the building in this season's initiative and confronts the Harts, who have the eight-dimensional front, the next Sunday.
Before this fight, the Reinzers welcome Rapind Vienna in Europe League on Friday.
Livington in the middle continues to be reluctant to wear her hair in six games in her class, with the basic promulgator Holt not to have had any sex since she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before he ran, with her ability to bring the Rangers into a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and decided to get there a little before the end, but Alan Lithcow gave up his effort to cut Craig Halket's head away from the end.
The farmers let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attract visitors to free prints and banners.
And that's how the big ice came.
The Reinzers couldn't stop a free press, and Livingston did the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to send the ball to Mengka, who took it and cut it off from the center of the area.
Until then, the Reinzers had ruled in the possession of the ball, but found the land defence undisputed, and the final prisoner, Liam Kelly, did not face difficult situations.
This form continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos has removed the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's old man was pulled out of the ranks of Reinzers Alan McGregor, and Lithcow's step went out on another free shot at Livington.
There were many seats in Livington's area and they were constantly retreating, while two pins were requested - after the release of the ball from Halket against the supplemental player Glen Mintelton and one for the hands - who were rejected.
"Excellent game" from Livington - analysis
Alsander Lambont from BBC Scotland in the field of Tony McCaronne Arena
Thematic performances and results for Livington.
All of them were exceptionally exceptional, extending their expectations in this unusual course.
The style of the game and their personality changed at least after their return to the top shape, but the characters should also be given to the Holt for the promotion he gave to the team with his appointment .
His team had so many heroes.
President Halket was exceptional, returning an extremely organized defense, while Mengka kept Connor Goldson and Joe Ourell in custody throughout the game.
Reinzers, however, had no inspiration.
As good as they were in the past under the direction of Gerard, these standards were not met.
The last of the games were weak - only once they managed to pass the ground protection, and this is a warning campaign for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the list.
Amicable emotions at Erdogan's reception in Colonia
The weather was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the leaders of the Turkish and German states for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's suspicious visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had come up with issues such as human rights, freedom of type and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Colonia to set up a new big game.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police prevented the concentration of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters were forced to come close to see their president.
Tens of speakers against Erdogan - many of whom from Kurdish origin - have also given the present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The judgment of the exhibitors reflects the questionable nature of a visitor who is treated by some Turks as hero and others as lawyers.
Road accident in Detford: death of a motorcycle after car crash
A pilot lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident was near the intersection of the Bested Street and Evelin Strit roads, a long-distance road in Detford, in the easternmost part of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and the nurses of the hospital tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The comparison was noted a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and killed a driver, who lost his life on the Cylter Strit road, some 1.6 miles [1.6 km] away from the Sabbath accident.
The Metropolitical Police stated that the authorities are making efforts to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
The roads have been closed and the roads of the buses have been blocked, while the guides have been given instructions to avoid the area.
Long Lartine Prisons: Six police officers were injured in complex situations
Six police officers were injured in injuries inflicted on high-security men, according to the reports of the Prison Directorate.
Some have found out about 09:30 BST on this LongLardin Highway prison and are still in progress.
Special police forces "Tornado" have returned to deal with the horrors involving eight states and which have been expressed in one party.
The police were observed with microtraps in the face during the complex.
A prison representative said: "A particular trained staff was able to deal with the incident in the prisons of this Grand Long Laartin.
Six members of the staff were injured.
We are not concerned with violence in our prisons, and we clarify that those responsible will be handed over to the police authorities and may impose more punishment."
There are more than 500 states in the prisons of this Greater Long Lattin, some of which are among the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the Prison Manager was admitted to a hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, the prisoners were called upon to return the class to prison to be severely affected during which members of the staff were subjected to an attack by milliard bullets.
Typhoon Roza threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with raindrops (areas with drought may be welcomed)
It is a rather tragic experience to hit Arizona, but this is precisely possible to happen at the beginnings of the next week, as the remains of the rock Rosa will cross the northern parts of the river, bringing raindrops into their period.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued an extensive warning of floods for Monday and Tuesday from the western Arizona to the south and east Nevada, eastern California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagastaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
St. Rosa is expected to cross just above Phoenix on Tuesday, where she will be late Monday with a shower.
Fonix's National Meteorological Service pointed out on Twitter that only "ten tropical cycles have remained in a changing direction or less barometer in a distance of less than 200 miles from Fonix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a typhoon in a distance of less than 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The last models of the U.S. National Centre of Steel provide for a 2-4-indication of 2 to 4 inches, with a single flow of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other regions of South-West Cities, including the Central Iron and Great Basin Bridges, it is possible to mark peaks of 1 to 2 inches, with a possibility of a single total flow of up to 4 inches.
For areas not threatened by floods, the rain brought by Rosa can be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although the floods are a very serious issue, a part of this phenomenon is expected to be happy, as the South American countries today live in conditions of drought.
According to the U.S. Department of Public Health, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least a long drought, which is the second highest category of drought," said weather.com.
First, Uncle Rosa will come to the capital of the Chersonian Basha California of Mexico.
Keeping the pressure of the piston, on Sunday morning the Rosa will be located 385 miles south of the Fifth Eugenia of Mexico with a maximum of 85 miles per hour and will move north at 12 miles per hour speed.
The drought will meet more cold water in the Irish and, therefore, it will be strengthened.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive at the crater in Mexico with a sudden decline in the morning or the evening of the morning.
It is possible to detect an intense flooding in regions of Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of floods.
"Average total flow angles of 3 to 6 inches from Bacha California to the north-west Sonora, which may reach up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Next, Rosa will be guided north by crossing Mexico as a terrorist attack again and will arrive at Arizona's borders early in the morning as a tropical smaller barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach south Jutta on Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected by the Russian typhoon or its lists is the very intense floods in the Bahamas California, the North Sonora and the South American States," said the US National Centre for Typhoonism.
These nests are expected to cause dangerous heavy raindrops and snowflakes in the sands and guides in the soils.
Visit to Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for crimes against humanity
Three fugitives and a 20-year-old were gathered as survivors of humanity’s suicide after discovering a 16-year-old who had been wounded by a soldier in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the area Exelcior Teras of Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
She was transferred to the hospital, where she remained in a "firm" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were gathered during the night in the Randstock area, reported by the police of Eivon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who could have recorded on a video on the phone what happened.
Trab says Cabano has "lived the evil and the evil" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Cabano is a vote to reject the rules of the Democratic Party's minors and executives," Trab said at a conference in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trab stated that Cabano "lived the worst and the worst" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of demonstrating it as a voter.
Kavano filed to Congress on Friday, refused charges and apparently began the allegations of Christine Blazi Ford that she was sexually assaulted ten years ago when she was divorced.
Ford also put before the audience for her claims.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the great, the quality and the heat" of the Cabano on that day.
"The vote to confirm the independence of Judge Cabano is one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a law with an excellent public service," said the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The President was directly mentioned in the candidateship of Cabano, while he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the inter-elections.
"We have five weeks of one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not a candidate, but in fact it's like I am," he said.
"That's why I travel all the way to support exceptional candidates."
Trab stated that the Republicans are on the mission of "sustaining and protesting".
The first important procedural vote in Georgia on the independence of Cuba is expected to take place later in Paris, referring to the CNN as the most helpful member of the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people killed by rape and tsunamis in Indonesia and the total number of deaths is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were expelled from the giant gangs that conquered the rocks, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Solauese in Indonesia, the authorities declared the Syrian.
Hundreds of people had been assembled for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu in Paris, when six - foot - high [5 m] peaks approached the top of the tower, passing many to death and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was revealed after a 7.5-Richter earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunamis was expressed last night, the world was still on the beach and did not get away immediately, so it was hit by it," said Sutopo Purjo Nogorho, a representative of the Indonesian BNPB disaster management service in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, carjacked, wood, house, hit everything on the wall," said the Northrocho, adding that the tsunami had traveled on the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people dug the trees to swim out of the snow and grew up, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palau.
Aerobic photographs published by the disaster response service show many damaged buildings and buildings, bridges that have been damaged and destroyed and a well surrounded by water.
Translations continued to plague the city on Saturday.
The tsunamis have been heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) reported that the energy released from the Great Depression was about 200 times greater than the power of the personal bomb that fell in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a stone slab, can increase the size of the town, he said.
Norway described the damage as "extended" and said hundreds of houses, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels were destroyed.
He said that corpses were found buried under the walls of the buildings they destroyed, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 refused.
Nogorho said that the victims and damages may be larger along the 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Dongella, which is closer to the center of the settlement.
The communications systems "are completely lost and there is no information" from Donegala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," said Stairs in his statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are directed to the areas they have completed.
"It's already a tragedy and it can be even more handy," he said.
He was critical of the Service on the Sabbath because he did not announce that the tsunami had struck Paul, even though according to the officials, the time had arrived for the warning to be issued.
In a dramatic video reported on social networking, a man on the top floor of a building shouts a panic by trying to warn people down the road for the tsunami that is coming.
In a few minutes, a water tank approaches the coast, passing houses and cars.
Reuters was not able to check the video's frequency immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great halt, which also cut off communications in Paul’s larger area, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army started sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the missing ones continue to need anonymous food and other basic types of first need.
The city's airport has just opened up to contribute to the healing efforts and will remain closed until October.
He's scheduled to visit President Joe Windonto at the centre of the exhibition in Palo on Sunday.
The tsunami victims in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the organization's staff of World Vision from Donggala managed to arrive safely in the city of Paul, where the workers found shelters from museums standing at the front of their office, they went through disaster scenes on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief teams have received the painful task of starting the procedure for the rehabilitation of the victims, some complain that they are not visiting foreigners, especially experienced workers in the field of relief to travel to Paul.
According to Indonesia's regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the place of an interest is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It continues to be a disaster at the beginning," said Aulia Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Warehouse.
"When the government says it is a national disaster, we can address an application for international assistance, but there is no relevant decision yet."
As he spent the second day in Paris after the earthquake and tsunami of Paris, friends and family who continue to miss still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the story of these natural disasters less appealing.
On Saturday, a little boy was kidnapped by a subcontractor.
During the Lord’s Evening Meal, a woman who had been slaughtered under the cover of darkness for two days was released by the healers beside her mother’s dead body.
Grenton Subanton, the head of the National Election Group of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing electoral officers for the Asian Agonists, who were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who went to the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Madajy, were his students.
"As an elder in the struggle of the elected side, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Grenton went on to say how, when the news were circling out of Rome's hotel in the community of the electoral districts, he began sending unfavourable messages to his opposers in Paul's party on the beach.
However, the indication in his messages was a green symbol "n", rather than two blues.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Clubs spent $26,750 on self-recovery in Newport de la levies.
On Friday morning, the prisoners spent $26,750 on a Brink's staff who was carrying out an ATT machine in Newport and the Levy, according to a Newport Police Department's type-examination.
The driver of the vehicle had destroyed an ATM machine in the respiratory system and was ready to hand over more money, said police officer Dennis Macarty.
While he was employed, another man "came running back from Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
The witnesses saw many suspects leave the scene, according to the report, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport police, calling at 859-292-3680.
Make West: The rapper changes his name to J.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Yee.
Advertised the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is well-known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been listening here for a long time to the Grandfather’s son and has used this false name as a title for his album, which circulated June.
The change was preceded by its appearance in the version of Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present the new album entitled Yandhi.
On the contrary, the poet Arina Grande, who rejected her appearance for "sensitivative reasons", said the Creator of the Soo.
In addition to being a summary of the professional name he uses today, West had previously stated that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think the word 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means "you," said West earlier this year, in a discussion about his album title with the radio producer Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name is changed from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Yee, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the oppressed ourselves, all of us.
The album is probably a replacement of who we are."
It's one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known by various names, such as Paf Dandy, P. D., and D. But he announced a year that he prefers the names Lav and Brader Lav.
A former West associate, TZE-ZI, is also satisfied with using his name with or without letters and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico decides not to use the army against citizens
Mexico's elected President, Andrew Manuel Lopez Obrador, concluded that he would never use military violence against citizens, as the country approaches the 50th floor of an amateur student riot.
Lopez Obrador was promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to force the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the forces fired at a peaceful show in the square, killing 300 people, during a period when the left-wing student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador was committed to supporting the new Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are encouraging young people to criminal charges.
The United States should double the funding for technical wisdom
As China is more active in the field of intellectual property, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this field, says the investor and professional in the field of technical intelligence, which is working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This statement is added to various parts of the US Government's communication on technical intelligence, since the US does not have an official strategy for technical intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China has recently presented its plan to become the first country in the world in innovation in matters of technical understanding until 2030.
"The duplication of the research budget for technical understanding would be a good principle, since all other countries are so lacking in the US and we are looking forward to making the next significant discovery in the field of technical understanding," Li said.
The duplication of the budget could double the possibilities for a country in the USA to receive the next major impact in the field of technical understanding, Li said at its meeting with the CBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The superpowers of Chinese, Silicon Balei and the new world order) circulated this month from the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt editions, is the Director of the Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the top companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a smart understanding system that won the best American player Otello, while later he was an executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's annex to China.
Lee recognized the importance of previous US government technology competitions such as the United States Anti-Semitic Action Service for Defence (DARPA), and was discussed when the next event will take place in order to identify the following viewers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the best of the academic area, it's companies," he said.
Facebook, Google, and other technological companies have taken students from universities to work on matters of practical understanding in recent years.
Li also argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the field of technical understanding.
"I believe that a green card should be offered automatically to teachers' diploma holders in the technical sense," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a Plan for the Development of the Next-Agency Acting Genius.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other government agencies share money with American researchers, but the quality of the academic project in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence has set up a Joint Centre for the Lawgiver, in which partners from the business and academic world will be involved, and the White House announced the formation of an Chosen Commission on the Lawgiver.
That month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 million in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Institute of Sciences invests more than 100 million dollars a year in research in the field of intellectual engineering.
In the meantime, no progress has been made here for months in the U.S. legislation with a view to establishing a National Security Commission for the Force of Law.
The citizens of the DPRK make a resolution to decide whether to change the country's name
The people of the GDR participated in the Syrian declaration to decide whether the country would be transferred to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a movement that would have been held for decades with Greece that had blocked the country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a partnership with the name Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighboring country represents a delegation on its territory and has been active in its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but national opponents argue that the change will undermine the national identity of the Slavic majority of the population of the DPRK.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the resolution and a mpoicotaz campaign has created doubts as to whether participation would reach the required 50 per cent in order to be valid for the resolution.
The question on the vote was: "You are in favour of NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece".
Representatives of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaef, claim that it is a price worth paying to promote integration into organisations such as the EU and NATO for GDP, one of the countries that have emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I have come here today to vote for the country's future, so that young people of GDP can live freely under the framework of the European Union, because this will make our lives more secure," said Oliver Georgievska, 79 years old in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, many Members of the House have stated that they will comply with the outcome of the vote in order to become definitive.
A majority of two-thirds of the Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Elections Committee stated that there were no press reports up to 1 pm.
However, the participation reached only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, so he gave this 66 per cent of the votes cast.
"I have come to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said 62-year-old Joe Tanevski, a voter in the prime minister, Skopje.
The prime minister of GDP, Zoraf Zaef, Zorika's husband and son Dusko voted in the resolution on the change of the country's name which would open the way for the country's entry into NATO and the European Union to the city of Strumica of GDP on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavartarkov, 54 years old, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes that have been represented by those who will mobilize the resolution.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to engage with the head high, not as partners in the second category," Kavartarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the charitable union."
Prime Minister Zaef said that NATO's entry will result in numerous investments in GDP, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that corporate prosperity will be good, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaef after he voted.
He said that a positive outcome would be "the confirmation of our future."
According to a statement published last Monday by the Institute for Political Affairs of the DPRK, the resolution would involve between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters, i.e. less of the required participation.
According to another publication produced by the Telma TV station of the DPRK, 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote positively.
In order to succeed in this resolution, the participation must reach 50 per cent of the vote together.
If the resolution fails, this will be the first serious blow to the government's politics, from its generosity to its power last May.
Follow me: Sergei Aguro of Manchester City passed the entire defense of Briton to put a ball
Serhio Aguiero and Rahim Sterling made the defense of Briton winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Etchand Stedium in Manchester, England.
Aguro showed that he's running easy at 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker took a step in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Briton's soldiers before he left the open room.
In time, Aguro was found surrounded by four green players.
He pulled out a defense, leaving behind a few others outside the great area of Briton.
Then he put me on his left, finding Sterling.
The English Foreford made his first move in the area by returning the ball to Aguire, who used his right foot to win the Briton Matthew Ryan's finals, drawing on the right side of the right.
"Aurora faces some problems on his feet," said the editor of City, Pep Guaardiola.
"We said to play 55 and 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky to cut the ice at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the gladiators the initial advantage in Premier Lig's battle.
This guy came in 29 minutes.
Aguro got the ball deep in the Briton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful old man along the other side of Leroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball in his possession and led Sterling to the back docary.
The glass oven locked the ball in the net a little before it went out.
City faces Hoffenheim on the third floor of the Chabins Lig on 12:55 p.m. in the Rain-Nekar Arena village of Sydney, Germany.
Serger wants to win the Rockies.
Since Nisionals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But all the competing Serger hopes to play the Lord against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they continue to have effects on the Rockies on the play-offs, as they are preceded by a game of Los Angeles Dozers in Nassional Lig West.
The Rockies have gone through the games with their 5-2 victory against the Nasionals on Friday night, but they still want to lock the first place in their category.
"Although we don't have anything to win, at least we can play by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the waves and the other group will be a likely game of the highest level that I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to fight in such a fight?"
The Nassians have not yet announced who will be the original shape of the Lord, but it is said that they intend to let Serger throw the ball.
Serger, who will make his 34th start, made preparations on Friday and will play the Sunday, which is usually a day of rest for him.
The right-winger from Washington has an effect of 18-7 with average winning points (ERA) 2,53 and 300 UUT due to a strike in 220 2/3 times this season.
Trab makes a speech in West Virginia
The President was briefed on the situation with regard to his elected candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Mr Brad Kavano, in his speech on the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the internal elections.
"Everything we've done in November is broken.
We have five weeks from one of the most important electoral procedures in our life.
It's a very important moment, but I'm not a candidate, but in fact it's like I am, and that's why I travel all the way to support exceptional candidates," he said.
Trab continued, saying: "Look at this stupid, huge racist group of Democrats, see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to take the power back by using any necessary means. See the evil, the vanity.
They don't care who hurt, who have to opt for power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give them."
The Republicans, he said, have taken the mission of "sustainment and protest".
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, referring to the Democrats as "heavy and bad, stupid and lying."
The Court of Justice of Georgia referred to the name-named memory of the founder of the Danish Republic of Finland, a reference that was accepted with potential public trials.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you find the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for an answer. It was a really bad use of the body's language, the worst use of the body's language I've ever seen."
The Working Party is no longer a broad enlargement.
It is not insensitive against those who express their opinion
It didn't surprise me that Momentum's activists in my local team voted to make me a fool.
In addition, I am the last of a number of Members of the Working Party who said they were not welcome, precisely why we say that.
My colleague, John Ryan, had a similar reaction, because he was firmly opposed to anti-corruption.
In my case, my motion was made critical because I argued with Jeremy Corbin.
For the sake of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, for the same questions as Jeremy had argued with previous leaders.
The call for the meeting of the workers of the South African Republic stated that "we want our meetings to be productive with the participation of all".
In most of the eight years that I am a local member of the Working Group, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today is not this tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more flexible, more sympathetic" policy has been forgotten here and long, if it has never really started.
It is clear more often that the different views are not presented to the Working Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is accepted by the governing body of the Party.
This began a little after Jeremy became the leader, as my colleagues whom I previously thought we had similar political views started waiting for me to turn 180 pieces and adopt opinions that I would never agree with, either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Every time I spoke publicly, regardless of what I actually said, I heard a survey on social networking, where some asked for my resignation, explained the policy of the centre, and told me that I should not be a member of the Working Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am happier than my other colleagues, as the comments that addressed me were usually political.
I will remember the professionality and determination of my colleagues who face a host of sexual or racist attacks every day, but they never suffer.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this time's policy is how abuses are viewed as more normal.
Jeremy Corbin confirmed last week that the Working Party should encourage a culture of openness.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad extension and that with each proposal for a model or change of the electoral rules, the terms of the party are inconceivable.
I've been advised for the last two years that I don't stand up, that I don't talk too much and that's how it's gonna be all right.
But I didn't go to politics to do this.
Since I joined the Working Party 32 years ago, as a student, because of the statement made by the Government of Tatser, who had successfully managed my whole class, my goal was to provide better public services for those who need them more, either as a member of the local council or as a government minister.
I never covered my policy, and I did the same in the last elections.
No one in South-East could have fought in any way with regard to my political views and points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who have promoted the proposal for a holiday in Paris, I have only to say that while the country is faced with a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on whether I trust the leader of the Working Party.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to members of the Momentum movement in South Africa, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political objectivity will prevent me from acting as I think it is to the best interests of all of you.

Ir - Melrouz: 38 - 17: The impostor Iir passes through the mountain
Two late ices may have broken down like the final result, but there is no doubt that Ir was determined to win this extraordinary psychological battle today in the Zent initiative.
It is now located at the top of the list, the only innocent group of ten.
Finally, it was her highest defense, as well as the best exploitation of opportunities, which made the sugar for the landers, and the coach Peter Mortis had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still innocent, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Cristy of Melrous said: "Thanks to Ireland, the opportunities were better than we were."
Grant Anderson's club in the 14th minute, with the conversion of Fraser Climus, brought Ir before, but a quick card to Scottsjo Rory Huggs, who was committed to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrous to perform the digital advantage, and Jason Baggot pointed out a ball without conversion.
Climus increased the appearance of Iir with penalti, just in time, a glove with conversion, leading Iir to the backbones with a 17-5.
But Melrouz started the second good day and Patrick Anderson's ice, with the conversion of Bacot, reduced the forecast to five degrees.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Rurid Nod, which was removed by a unit, and after the re-launch, Ireland also increased the difference between a golf course of Stafford McDoual, with the conversion of Climus.
Compulsory leader Blair McKrenson then received a black card, and Melrous again exercised the digital advantage with Bruce Calvin's glove without conversion, after a long period of intense pressure.
The farmers came back, however, and when Strawan Hatsinson received a quick card for a truck in Climo without the ball, from the penant line, Mackenson pointed a ball at the back of the attack that Iir had left.
Clima made a change, as she had done nearly since the reopening, after Kelly Rowe first collected David Armstrong's lock and sent out Gregor Henry away for the fifth floor of the ground.
Still Game's competitor starts a new career at the station
The competitionr of the Still Game Ford Kiernan shows ready to move to the station, after finding out that he has been appointed director of an approved restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's public release, which he writes and he competes with here and his annual partner in the Greek Hempfield code.
The couple announced that the next Friday cycle would be the last of the show and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Gaigland.
According to the official records, he is the manager of the Aørmorn Limited company.
The actor refused to explain the information, even though the source of Scottish Sun was suspected that Kirnan wants to work with the "large-scale station" in France.
"The sea is ours": The Bolivian district hopes that the court will again open the way to the Iranians
The ships are engaged in the fully equipped seamanship at La Paz.
In public buildings, they're wearing smooth marks.
On the basis of the seabed from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the sentence is written: "Our sea is legally owned.
It's our duty to take her back."
Throughout the region of central Bolivia, the memory of the film that Hilly set up after a terrible crisis for the use of natural resources in the 19th century continues to be alive, as is the fate of his people to travel to the Iberian Ocean once more.
These hopes have been reflected today more than ever, here and for decades, as Bolivia expects the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has the power, a spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the result with a positive view," said Roberto Calzantila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the publication of the decision of the International Court of Justice at large windows throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favour of the Bolivian decree to require Chile, after decades of harsh talks, to negotiate for Bolivia to give a capital out of the sea.
Evo Morales, the proud Vice-President of Bolivia, who gives an ambitious fight for his election next year, has much to win or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Black Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia and that, even if it did, they would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to grant thousands of land and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be issued just six months after the final proceedings is presented indicates that the case was "not too complex," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of further promoting Bolivia's objectives, the past four years may have been regretted.
"Today's Bolivian government has raised the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Moral's positive rhetoric has been overcome by every subsequent good release of Hillis, he supported.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to make discussions after this.
The two countries have not changed since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Belge, a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making process of the court was urgent.
On Monday, Bolivia will get "a great opportunity to establish a new time of relations with Chile" and the possibility "to end up in 139-year-old conflicts with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzandilla also refused that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular leaders in Latin America, uses the issue of exit to the sea as a political offence.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to have access to the Northern Ocean," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past."
North Korea says there won't be a nuclear weapon if it can't be trusted by the US
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Young Ho, says his state will never fire his weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United States General Assembly.
He invited the United States to implement the commitments made during a summit in Singapore to the heads of the two states.
Ray made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pobbeo seems ready to start the nuclear diplomacy that had reached the end, three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader, Kim Young Wyn.
Ri says that the view that continued sanctions and the refusal of the US to declare the end of the Korean War will sometimes require the North to "wine" is a dream of a warm night.
Washington is reluctant to agree to make the statement, unless Piongyang takes the first important movement of equipment.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trab want a second summit.
But there is a broad perspective on whether Penguin is seriously thinking of declaring a weapon that the country considers likely to be the only means to ensure its safety.
Pombeo plans to visit Penguin next month to prepare a second Kim-Trab summit.
The exhibitions in Paris reveal the latest trends in the upper caps that will soon be available in a system near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats you have or to avoid entirely the sun, then stop looking.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of ultrasound hats to collect their Opening-Calocari 2019 that stole the presentation at the Week of Fashion in Paris.
The Instagram was set up this good afternoon, and their designers sent their impressive creations to the bakery.
The part he separated from Valentino was a supervolving cape cap with a plate of cane that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other high-fashioned giants were carpused with stones, a macho hat, even a knife, but these have not been designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, over the clock for Halloween.
Many of the multipronged masks had broken wires and passed more to Hannibal Lecter than in high rap.
One creature brought to the new full equipment of steam and oil, while another looked like a hot bread in a corner.
And if you want to adopt this style of fashion with the big players, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could be reached in central commercial roads near you.
The overcrowded hats made their appearance very quickly after the La Bomba, the searchable hat with the very wide area that we have seen carry so many, from Riana to Emily Ratikovski.
The public tree that created the extraordinary cable that opened the social networks also sent another great creature to the paserala, a sandy sandy bag almost as big as the model that drives it with its magic.
The porcelain bag of raffles, decorated with raffles and a white dress, was the part that separated from the collection La Riviera Open-Calocairy 2019 of Jacquemus in the Week of Fashion in Paris.
The designer, Luke Armitz, said in the F.D. column: "I'm waiting to see big hats and large sea bags in the next summer, as the designer made so much sense that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for overcrowded hunters."
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a history of academic achievement, which has continued in 2018, with yet another series of excellent results in the trials, which have only been strengthened more than personal and collective achievements in the arts, art, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are fighting to provide the best possible level of services to students and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and highest levels of education, the professional course they will choose and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an order-based school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable education in schools.
Nelson Mandela had said, "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, then what you say goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say is in his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
On the basis of the recent results of the fetish examinations, we find that languages are at the top of the performance boards, with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved the degree of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students had achieved a degree of A in Mandarin, 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also had a degree of A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future.
Languages today, as an election lesson, are considered equally important with science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programmes of education of independent schools and others.
An EU Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 revealed that, with regard to the reasons for which workers were difficult to cover jobs, a percentage of the 17 per cent category concerned the lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, the need for linguistic skills becomes increasingly urgent in order for young people to be prepared for their future professional career.
Since more future employment opportunities require language skills, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career anyone will choose, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because of this right that can be valued throughout his life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have a advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults in the U.S. in 2013, 75 percent of the respondents were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a discussion, while French was the only language that spoke the majority of the respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investment in language education today is important for today's children.
Knowing many languages, especially the languages of the developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered more important for the U.S. by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested, there will always be some languages to choose from the independent schools, which have a specialized educational staff in this field.
The independent schools of Scotland provide an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever if they are preserved in the future.
No one can deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the country's future, so this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multi-culturality and restriction to the young people of Scotland.
They have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Council of the Independent Schools of Scotland.
Lebron's gonna make his debout to Lakers the Sun in San Diego.
The expectation of the fans who refuse to see Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakes has reached its end.
Leicester Luke Walton's teacher announced that James would play the Lord in the first game before the standoff period against the Danver Nagquets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet decided how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at Lakes' official website.
Laker's reporter Mike Truwell wrote on Twitter that James might be playing for a few minutes.
After a few days in advance, James was asked about his plans for the six games that Lakers had to give before the competition period.
"I don't need preparations at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
The Trab concentration in West Virginia, Canali YouTube
President Donald Trab began a series of conferences starting with Wiling in West Virginia.
It is for the first of five Trab's planned conferences next week, which includes districts in friendly areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
By confirming his election for the Supreme Court's election to be suspended, Trab seeks to strengthen public support for the forthcoming inter-elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress with the November vote.
What time is Trab's concentration in West Virginia last night, and how can you watch it online?
The ‘Trab’ concentration in Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 μm tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trab concentration in West Virginia online below via a live stream on YouTube.
Trab is likely to be mentioned in the hearings this week for the appeal for position in the Supreme Court, Brit Kavano, which took place in a closed atmosphere due to allegations of sexual harassment, with a vote confirming Germany's expectations for up to a week while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
However, the primary objective of this series of conferences is to help the Republicans who deal with the November elections to win some power.
Thus, the end of President Trab's campaign stated that these five conferences next week aim at "mobilization of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of Russia and the Council of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so critical for its agenda, which the president travels to as many cities as possible, as we travel through the multi-stakeholder period of the army," said Reuters, a representative of the Trab army, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The planned for tonight's evening conference in Wesbanco Arena of Wiling could bring supporters from "The Ohio and Pennsylvania and speed up the coverage of Pittsburgh's media", according to the newspaper West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month that Trab is visiting West Virginia, the country that won by a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trab is trying to help Patrick Morissei, a representative of the Republican people in West Virginia for Georgia, who is less in the media.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisie that the president must come and try to give him a promotion to the hills," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. Group has the ability to fight by keeping alive the hopes as it leads to the Lord's Singles
After three single games, Saturday's 4ths might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
It is an entirely understood game idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such rehearsals.
Where would they say there's a hole now?
"It was six degrees past and now it's four, so maybe we've got a little hole," said Jordan Speth as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, to move forward with four levels and to remain twelve still in the game.
The Americans, as Spt says, feel the "air on their shoulders" and have a lot to encourage, like the fair Sprith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each lost three degrees of four.
Spith was a killer from tea in green and gives the example.
The sounds of gambling became more powerful as he continued around, making a critical hit to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were under two after two.
The shooting they won the game at the 15th was accompanied by appropriate pangs showing their conviction that the American team is not alone.
"You have to look inside yourself deeply and worry about your own game," Spith said.
It's what every player has left.
18 pieces to write a story.
The only players with more degrees than the Speth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fletgut, the incredible story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but valuable heritage of Europe has fallen four to four, and it seems to do nothing wrong.
The "Moligate" was the only thing that didn't hit bogey on Saturday's evening, but also left the bogeys on Saturday's morning, Friday's morning and Friday's afternoon back nine in the morning.
This game, as well as the way in which energy seems to go to and from the horrors, ensures that they are players who should win the Lord and that there is no more popular player than Flygund or Molinari to win a possible European victory while the sun goes over Le Golf National.
At the same time, both in different shapes.
The debate on European customs is still ahead.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson put the girls in Sertio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Norren.
With a bogey and two doubles at front nine they had Spain and Sweden so deep in a hole that they couldn't get out of it.
The Lord, however, there will be no one to help you get out of your ass.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting to watch them closely because of the interaction between spouses, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how a strategy can change at any time.
Europe has played a better role as a group so far and has an important precedent on the last day, but this fighter foursome has also shown that the U.S. group has killed, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the advance 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after its fourballs and Saturday foursomes with 10-6 against the US.
The inspired poem of Tommy Flytgund and Francesco Molinari formed a two-winning game in a fighter Tiger Junts and was able to take the lead in Le Golf National so far at the four levels.
The European side of Thomas Bourne, who is trying to maintain the path he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, headed the American side at the morning fourball, with a series of 3-1.
The United States was more opposed to the Foursomes, winning two battles, but they could not cover the difference.
Jim Furrick's side needs eight of the 12 single games of the Lord to keep the track.
Flidgut is the first new European player to win four series, along with Molinari, known as Molygut, after a colonial Saturday is only the second winning four in the first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having defeated Woods and Patrick Reid in the Fourballs, they joined their forces to defeat a powerful Hunt and American new-founded Brian Dessabbo with another more obvious 5&4.
Judds, who was involved in the two Sabbaths, showed a random burst of light, but he has lost more than 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who was entertained for the morning fourballs, returned to Henry Stanson's companion for the foursomes with 2&1 of the Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cape, winning the first and third positions in the world order.
They didn't go well for Europe, except for the happy, sunny day of Paris holiday.
Three times the winner, Jordan Spartacus and Justin Thomas, made the trip for the Americans twice a week.
They won a difficult 2&1 victory on the John Ram and Jan Poulter of Spain at the Fourballs and later returned to win the Poulter and Rory McKilroy 4&3 at the Foursomes while they had lost both holes in the open.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a group could recover while they had four degrees in the singles, although because he's the editor, Furic is enough to succeed in maintaining the path.
However, after the second position for two days, it seems that an objection to the Lord is beyond their ability.
North Korea says it is not going to be left alone without confidence measures.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions raise the feeling of uncertainty about the United States and that his country is not going to leave its nuclear weapons exclusively under such conditions.
R. Young Ho said in the annual general meeting of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken "a significant measure of good will" last year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the removal of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment not to deliver nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"In the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no way to start our equipment alone."
While Ri has again been aware of North Korea's opposition to Washington to a possible "sustainable" approach to abortion, according to which North Korea would be persecuted as a step forward in the process, its statement was important as it did not completely eliminate the monetary decommissioning, as Pingang did in the past.
Ray was mentioned in the joint communiqué of Kim Young Wyn and Donald Trab at the first summit held in the country between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim was committed to working on "rehabilitation of the Korean Army", while Trab was committed to guarantee security for North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Penguin must first "give" its nuclear weapons.
Washington was also opposed to the appeals for relief from the severe international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The United States strives to become "first detonation" and increases pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their goal by putting even obstacles to the "declaration of the end of the war", RI said.
"The idea that sanctions can be born to us is a dream that we don't know.
But the problem is that continued sanctions increase our uncertainty."
RI did not make any reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trab, which the U.S. leader mentioned to the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister, however, noted three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Mü J-in over the last five months and added: "If the partner in the issue of abortion was South Korea and not the United States, the retirement of the Korean leadership would not have come to such an end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from Friday, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the goal of the United States in favour of North Korea's ballistic fires was inevitable because the "Great President" Trabb called Kim "piralman" on suicide.
A year in the United Nations, Trab, who recently threatened to "completely return" North Korea, chose Kim's army to move forward with the disarmament measures, but said that there must be more to be done and that the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is abolished.
On Tuesday, Trab said he didn't have a timetable for this, saying, "If they need two years, three years or five months, it's okay."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should focus Penguin on the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pobbeo told the UN Security Council on Friday that "the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue to be intense and inexhaustible until full, final and confirmed retirement is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to allocate funding to the Pingang Fire and Ballistic Fire Programmes.
Pombeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Beijing next month to prepare for a second summit.
Bobeo has visited North Korea three times a year already, but his last trip was not going well.
He left Piongangang on July saying that he had made progress, so that North Korea would complain to him a few hours later that he had "the requirements of a gangster".
North Korea was committed to a meeting with Moon this month to launch a nuclear installation and also a nuclear conflagration if the United States took "reactive measures".
He explained that Kim Tou said that the "response measures" he sought were security assurances that Trab had been promised in Singapore and were promoting the reconciliation with Washington.
Harvard students follow lessons on how to enjoy enough
Last year, a new school at Harvard University encourages all natural students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing mass culture of the late night study with the consumption of a lot of caffeine.
One academic found that students in Number 1 university worldwide often do not know basic things, such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, professor of liver cancer at Harvard Medical School and a qualified doctor at the University of Brigham and Women's, designed the school, which he believes is his first type in the United States.
It was urged to start the study after a talk on the effects of sleep loss on the study.
"At last, a girl came and said to me, "Why am I learning about this just now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever spoken to her about the importance of sleep - something surprised me," she said in The Telegraph.
The study, which started for the first time of the year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as to improving general wellbeing.
Paul Barrera, professor of medicine at Harvard School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to include the education when it was found that students were asleep in the week to a significant extent.
The study includes a series of workshops.
In a unit, there is a picture of a schoolhouse where students click on bottled coffee, curgins, sports shoes and books to inform about the effects of coffee and light, how the sports performances affect the lack of sleep, and the importance of smoking.
In another unit, participants learn how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of stroke, headache, depression and cancer.
A map of the university, with interactive icons, encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the students' behaviour immediately.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," added Professor Chisler.
Its culture to get back because you studied all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and constant pressure on students means that breathing sleep is a problem that arises.
The enough sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid increasing weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a sleepy state, resulting in a lasting feeling of pain.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old Calvinist who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Cisler to design the course, following one of his former classes, the first year in Harvard.
He said his education opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a lesson across the university.
The next step, she hopes, is to ask all the development students to monitor a similar program before starting their studies in this particularly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chisler advised the students to set up a notification of the time they should go to sleep, as well as the engine for the hours of sleep, and to know the harmful consequences of the "white light" emitted by electronic windows and LED lighting, which can harmonise the circular rule by leading to sleep problems.
Livingxon - Reinzers 1-0: Mengka's making ice cream on Gerard's men
The Reinzers suffered another painful exodus outside the building, as Dolly Mengka's sweat led the coordinated side of Steven Gerard's et cetera with 1-0 in Livingstone.
The Group of Imbrogs sought to mark the first of the win outside the building of February with the 4-1 in St. Johnstown, but the group of Gary Holt proclaimed Gerard's second bet in 18 games as a preacher, leaving the group eight behind Harts, which is the first on the list of the Ladbrokes initiative.
Mengka hit seven minutes before the day, and Reiner's rebuffer seemed unable to respond.
While Reinzers is now heading to the seventh position, Livington is heading to the third, with just one angle different from the preceding Hiberniaan.
And Reinzers can wait for other bruises, as Lieutenant Colum Spence had to get first aid for injury to the head caused by an object that fell off the floor.
Gerard made eight changes in the team composition and disappointed Ireland in the Betfred Cup medals.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same "Live 11" composition that he took a degree from Hart last week and would be happy to see how this fine machine could inspire any attempts of opponents.
Reinzers may have been in possession, but Livington did more with the ball.
He should've been watching the second minute, when Menga's first remote pass sent Scott Pitman into Alan McGregor's area, but the middle didn't find the ball.
A very free suit by Kigan Jacobs found the leader, Craig Halket, but my friend Alan Lithcow's lawyer was the only thing he could do was send the ball away from the dock.
Reinzers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game in the last three.
Alfredo Morelos surely believed he should have won a penance at the 15th, as compared with Steven Lowells, but the solicitor Steven Thompson ignored the curses of the Columbian.
Reinzers had only two shots in the first day, but Imbrox's former prisoner, Liam Kelly, didn't worry about anything from the head of Lassana Kulibali and Ovie Ezaria's subtwine.
Although Libya was clearly below expectations in the first 34 minutes of the war, no one can be denied that he deserved the victory for the effort and only.
And Reinzers failed again to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallaher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his smile and found Mengka, who just finished the attempt.
Gerard made changes in the day-to-day by leaving Kulibali and by setting up Ryan Kent. The change gave him almost immediately, as the train dropped the ball into Morelos, but the printing Kelly pulled out of his line to block him.
However, Livington continued to lure the fans into the style of the game he knows and enjoys, with the Lithuanians and the Halcettes to remove one distant old after the other.
Holt's side could have raised the difference to the end, but McGregor had dealt with Jacobs himself, stopping him before Lithcous's attempt at the corner.
Reinser's complement, Glen Middleton, had another stage for penance to the end, as he was confronted with Jacobs, but Tomson also ignored it.
Almanac: The Exhibitor of Detective Gagger
A page by Almanac Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882: like today, 136 years ago and VALE ... the day in Germany was born by future natural Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Gagger.
Gigager developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, which eventually led to the device that is now known as the Gigager meter.
As a result of the eight-year-old science's film, Detective Gagger went to the poet's opera, such as in the 1950s with Bells of Coronado, with the competitors of the amazing Cambodian scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Andres: "What's this all about?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to detect radioactive metal elements, such as uranium.
When you hear these sounds, listen to the reaction of the people caused by radiation to metal elements."
You said, "Look, it's like crazy!"
Hans Gagker died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the discovery that bears his name continues its work.
A new anticarcinal vaccine teaches the immune to "see" the problem cells
A new anticancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" the problem cells and kill them.
Embolism teaches the anesthetist to recognize the problem cells during treatment
The method includes the export of immunosuppressants from the patient and their modification to the laboratory.
They can "give" a protein that is common to various types of cancer and continue to be re-injected
A vaccine under trial presents promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who received treatment with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the problem cells has seen the cancer of her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the export of immunosuppressants from the patient, their modification to the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common in many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski, from the U.S. National Institute of Carcinosis in the Besetside of Milan, said: "The results show that we have a very exciting vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzofski explained, the HER2 protein "completes the power engine for the development of a number of cancers", such as breast cancer, ovarians, respiratory and intramuscular cancer.
A similar approach that is used to treat a type of leukaemia has been developed by patients and then "injected" how cancer cells have been used to treat a type of cancer.
Kanye West was overcome by Trab, wearing a hat with the MAGA syndrome, after he appeared on SNL.
He didn't go very well.
Kanye West was tested at the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an alternative meeting in which US President Donald Trab announced that he would vote in the elections in 2020.
After also presenting the third song for the night, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball cap with the Mace America Great Again (to do America’s great again), he gave a diploma against the Democrats and renewed his support to the Tribe.
"Many times I'm talking to someone white and he says, "How do you like Trab? He's a rapist."
If I was worried about racism, I'd have been out of America for a long time," he said.
The SNL opened with a chat in which Matt Dimon, with Holingund's sister, announced the verdict of Bret Kavano before the Russian Court of Justice on the complaints of Christine Blazi Ford for sexual abuse.
Although not translated, the video with West's delay went up to social networking through the comical Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to break West with this addiction.
West also argued in the public that he was not treated well at meals because of his hat.
"They made me bulging in the kitchen.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
They made me bulging!
And they say I don't know what's going on with me," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "I don't know what's going on?
Try love."
His comments were tested at least twice by the public and SNL's factors seemed to be in a difficult position, said Variety, with a person saying in the newspaper: "The whole studio had a nervous breakdown."
West was called a replacement for the last moment of the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Robert McMiller, had escaped a few days earlier.
West had a lot of fun when he sang I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West supported Kandas Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who said: "Before one of the most gruesome spirits: TO THE ANTI-STATISTICS IN OHLO."
However, the presentation of the exhibition, Karen Hunter, pointed out that West was just "his own and that's great."
"But I choose not to blame anyone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "man") who I think is being distracted and sending out an idea that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
The same is true of us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it's more "the one that was previously known as Canie West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow his steps, also known as Paf Dandy, Pafi and P. Ddie.
Rapper Snoop Doug had changed his name to Snoop Leon and, of course, the style of music before he changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formly Know As Prince.
Type of murder experience for the attack by a soldier in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old was charged with murder after an assault on a man at the restaurant of East Belfast in Paris.
The incident occurred in Balikacamor, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear before Belfast's First Court on Monday.
The categories will be investigated by the Gospel.
Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, critical of toxicity
Kit Harington is known for the role of John Snow in the violent media show of HBO, the Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old driver condemns the hard-ass hero, saying that such roles in the window pass to the young boys the message that they should be hard to win respect.
Speaking in the newspaper The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something goes wrong" and wondered how to fight the problem of toxicity in #MeToo.
O Kit, who recently married his competitor at Game of Thrones, Rose Lesley, also 31 years old, was admitted to have a "strong view" on the subject.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much, where did we make the mistake of urgency?" he said.
"What do we learn from men as they grow, about the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxicity due to the rare characteristics proposed.
He continued: "What is the fruit and what is it taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, making young boys feel that they should show such behavior in order to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Almost something has gone wrong with our young people."
The conference also agreed that it is not intended to play in any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones, after the end of the series on the next Friday, saying "end in the wars and horses".
From November, Kitt will compete in the restoration of the True West project of Sam Separd, which leaves the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a poet.
The actor recently discovered that his knowledge with Rose's husband was the best he had ever received from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so somehow I enjoyed my future family and my life from here and beyond," he said.
Rose was subjected to the graffiti, John Snow's request, of the character that Kitt submits, in the Emmy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Lesley’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018, there were only about 40,000 new rounds.
In their corporate prosperity, the new scrolls were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus was exploding rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusion.
However, the number of people who were infected with HIV this way was almost undisputed, as China’s health authorities had said at a meeting in June.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LOT community of China.
The homophilia was decoyified in China in 1997, but the differences in the weight of the LATA community remain common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has been committed to universal access to HIV medicines, in the context of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters is a liar who has failed the data of the Republican geologists, condemns the "problem lies" and the "consolation theories"
This Saturday, U.S. representative Maxin Waters issued a statement that a member of her staff published personal information from three Republican seniors on the websites of the legislator Wikipedia.
The Republican Member of Los Angeles argued that the claims were promoted by students and websites of the "old right".
"Truths, lies and even more terrible lies," Waters reported on her Twitter statement.
The published information is included in the address of the home and telephone numbers of the Georgians Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatz of Yuta.
The information was published on Friday, and seems to have been published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill's environment during the hearing of the Georgian Committee on sexual harassment against Supreme Court Brit Kavano.
The explosion took place some time after the three geologists had challenged Kavanno.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, said that the IP address that identifies the source of contributions was linked to Waters' office and published the data of a member of Waters' staff, said The Hill.
"This absurd claim is completely true and convincing lies," said Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these false claims and false claims, was in no way responsible for the spread of these information.
This inexhaustible accusation is completely true and false."
Waters' statement was quickly accepted on the Internet, among others from the former White Paper writer Ari Fleser.
"This explosion is full of memories, Fleser wrote.
"This shows that he has no intention of being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he doesn't have to be angry.
It's not supposed to be a joke.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He must be peaceful and gentle."
Fleser seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Republican judge Cabano, who was accused by his critics that he seemed very angry at the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Nabaro, a representative of the Republicans who seeks to incite Waters in the inter-elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he said.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had notified "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these false claims".
"We will do everything we can to find the responsible," he continued, "and report on all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all my staff."
Critics of the film Johnny English Backdrop - a sub-tonnestic poppy movie with Rowan Ackinson
It is more tradition to look for Brexit's brands in every new British film, and this seems to apply to this revision of the French-cod action film with Johny Ingleis, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-entered in 2011 with Johnny English: The Return.
Can this hieroglyphic car deal with how clearly we are going to become the new opportunity of exports of the nation?
In any case, Mrs. Johnny Ingglis could renew his permission to make them a monster for a second time. His name says it's a broader chemical design designed for non-English film theaters.
It is, of course, about the amazing mystery actor who is claimed to have the painting and the ways of a mysterious actor, brings a little to Cluzo, with a dose from "master Bin" and something from the guy who only liked a song on the music theme of the film The streets of Fotai at the end of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on the traveling and international mysterious man that Ackinson once placed in Barclaycard's most forgotten television broadcasts, spreading the chaos at his end.
There are one or two nice moments in this last JE movie.
I liked it when Johnny Ingleis approached a helicopter with a medieval gun and the old men hit his country.
Atkinson shows his talent in the code, however, the chimory is quite subtle and strange, especially at the time that "very" cinematographic franchise such as the 007 and the Dangerous Apostles have more than enough comets.
The humor seems to be addressed to children and not to adults and, in my opinion, Johnny Ingleis's crazy assumptions are not as exorbitant and intimate as the tapes of the Ackinson movie type for the Bin's passage.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A government hacker has hacked into the super secret network of British spy networks, bringing out the identity of all British agents in a mission, to the great disappointment of the agent in service, which Kevin Eldon puts in a sad little role for his victims.
It is the last step for a well-known prime minister who is in the ranks of reform because of political resistance: Emma Thompson does what he can best with this character that reminds Teresa Mei, but the scenario is not particularly helpful.
The information consultants inform her that, as each active monitoring has been discovered, it is necessary to restore someone equipped.
And that means Johnny Ingleis, who is now working as a director at some aristocratic school, but gives a lot of lessons about mysterious actors: there are some nice scenes here, as England offers an academia of the type of a Great Rock School.
Ingglis returns to Withol for urgent information and is renewed with Buff's ex-and-old partner, whom Ben Miller is again subject to.
Buff is already married to a senior manager, a crazy role that Vicki Peperdin is not fully valued.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the ship for this Magnificent Music Service return to action, meeting the beautiful and part of Ophelia Bultova, under the hands of Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is threatened by the charismatic billionaire technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's technological challenges: the threat Jason Volta, quoted by Jake Lewis.
Ingglis and Buff begin their walk: converted as waiters, set fires in a cold French restaurant, cause chaos as they try to survive anonymously in the Bolt's multi-ethnic garden, and England causes initiation as she works to use a local reality device to be equipped with the inner house of Bolta.
All the balls are used in this last scene, but as valuable and fascinating and if it is, it continues to remember a little child television.
It's a few things.
And as with other movies, Johnny English: couldn't the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he would really grow up with his talent?
The Workers pretend to consider a plan to work for the British four days, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbin's Working Party is going to consider a radical plan to work for the British four days a week, but to be paid for five-day work.
The Party, according to information, shall endeavour to manage the savings achieved through the renewal of technical understanding (AI) to the employees by giving them an additional day free of charge.
Thus, workers will enjoy three days a week without reducing their share.
Sources say that the idea agrees with the economic agenda and the party's plans to return sugar for workers.
The four-week change was approved by the Labour Council as a means of benefiting workers from the transformed economy.
A further source from the Working Party stated in The Sunday Times: "A change of policy can be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen one night, but the four-week work week is a compliment that is attributed to the approach of the section to re-examine the economy for the workers, as well as the overall strategy of the section for the industry."
The Working Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Press Committee was promised four working weeks in the general campaign's 2017 general election.
However, this view is not currently supported by the entire Working Party.
A representative of the Working Party said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not examined by the party."
The writer of government gossip, John McDonald, used the last week's workshop to develop his view of a socialist economic recovery.
McDonald said he was determined to regain power from the "personal leaders" and the "prisoners" in the companies of common advantage.
The plans of the author of the government gossip also mean that today's participants in the construction companies may not take their full share back, as a potential government of the Workers could be made in "repetitions" due to suspects.
It also confirmed the plans to place employees in the corporate administrative councils and to create mutual participation funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual amounts up to 500 stars of England.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking at the 60 Minutes release about whether the FBI's investigation to Cabano could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brit Kavano launched the final vote on his appeal to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question whether the terms of the service could affect some Republican seniors to withdraw their support.
At the meeting of Sirius, Scott Pelley, in response to the 60-minute release, asked the Republican mayors John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could disturb anything that would have made them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Yes, it does," Kennedy said.
"I said that while going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cabano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly, "Did you do it?"
He was an intruder, determined, guilty."
However, Graham's vote does not seem to change.
"I've decided for Brett Kavano and I'll need an explosive category to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what happened: Bret refused to do," said Graham, mentioned at Christine Blazi Ford.
"And whoever's named, he can't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see it changing something new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will celebrate the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a rich program and famous stars, but also a similar impressive mission: eliminating world poverty.
For seven years now, tens of thousands are scheduled to interfere with the Great Law of Central Park within the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Kardy Bbi and Son Medie, but also to feel about the real objective of the event, which is the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is the development of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of those who are actively fighting against it.
In order to ensure a free ticket in the exhibition (except if they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), the interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", as they would wish to send an email to a world leader, to call or find other substantive ways to help them feel about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen, while they are still 12 years old to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of dealing with a free society the right way to convince our colleagues to take action or is it just another case of what is called "clicactivism", when some feel that they actually make the difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen Group has reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by its supporters, promoting a series of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to report commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications as a result of these actions, which have already been issued or concentrated at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the secured capital has so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the basic commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British alliance of investors and manufacturers, who have taken the commitment "to help children fully appreciate their capabilities", promised to give Rwanda $35 million to eliminate the claim, taking over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community as you are, we can make social injustice a sign in history," said Triisi Olman, president of The Power of Nutrition, in the public during the life together in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following the 5,000 actions and more that the United Kingdom called for the improvement of food for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, which is directed to 5 million women and children with food interventions.
Answering the question "what makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" which is included in the frequently asked questions on the website,
A member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the major human rights movements and counter-attacks before us, we will succeed, because we are united more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Son Mende, Kardy Bbi and Janel Mona are some of the artists who will appear in the New York's summer organisation, which will be presented by Deborah-Le Ferns and Hiu Jakman.
The U.S. can use the U.S. War Navy for "exclusion" by preventing Russia's exports of energy - Minister of the Interior
Washington can turn "if necessary" into its warship in order to prevent the provision of Russian energy on the markets, including the Middle East, as revealed by US Minister for Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's integration into Syria, where it works after a call from the legal government, is a challenge for the investigation of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons for those in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said, according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that the maritime routes will remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy will not be placed on the market," he said.
Zinke was directed to the participants in the event of a demonstration that was welcomed by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is characterised as the "word of the energy user" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia's and Iran's treatment, pointing out that they are really the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, in a little bit, the valuation and replacement of fuels," said Russia with the "only-known-one-ball" character, as there is an economy based on gold-based fuels.
Statements have been made as the administration of thetrab has taken the mission to strengthen the exports of American purified natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the most cheap option for European consumers.
For this reason, the administration of the Trab, including President Donald Trabb himself, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "delegated" project for the North Stream 2 that, according to the Trab, will become the Berlin "smoker" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Dr. Nord Stream 2, a project with a budget of 11 billion dollars, which is going to double the existing scope of the pipelines to 110 billion cubic miles, is a clean economic project.
Cremlin argues that the ongoing opposition of Washington to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we are participating in the view that energy cannot be a means of exertion and that consumers should be able to choose the water supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position led to the reaction of Germany, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's top organisation for industry, the German Industry Union (BDI), called on the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting with Germany's Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider whether it is possible to vote for the presidency in 2020, says the mayor of Massachusetts
The Commissioner of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that he would seriously consider the possibility of voting for the Presidency after the inter-elections.
At a meeting at the Hollywood Museum of Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he's examining the possibility.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and correct our problem government, and that's why a woman in the top needs it," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine the possibility of a vote for the Presidency."
Warren was critical of President Donald Trab during the meeting, saying that "it leads the country to wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trab is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't cover her words about Trab and his appeal for the Supreme Court, Brad Kavano.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren stated that "of course it is necessary for an FBI investigation before the vote."
A statement published on Friday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not believe that they should vote for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the complainant should not make an appeal, according to a statement by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
The 32% was in favour of such an appeal.
The statement showed more support for a possible appeal by former Governor Debal Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible appeal and 48% in favour of a possible appeal.
Other public names of the republics discussed in relation to a possible candidate for 2020 are former President Joe Banten and Ambassador Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Bainden said he would have decided officially by January, according to Associated Press.
Sara Peilin was mentioned in the Trak Peilin Meta-Traffic Stress at the Donald Trab concentration
Trak Peilin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his September military operation.
He was arrested and charged for domestic violence on Monday night.
"With what my son has been through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of the Injurious Transitional Strands and the injuries our soldiers experience when they return to their homeland," he said to the community at the conference for Donald Trab in Toulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilin described his conclusion as "a bomb ready to pick" and said about her son and other veterans that "they return a little different, they return stronger, they return wondering if there is respect for what soldiers, aircraft and any other member of the army have done for the country."
He met on Monday at Wasila in Alaska and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, an intervention in reference to domestic violence and armed robbery while he was in a state of emergency, according to Dan Bennet, a representative of the police department of Wasila.
18 Colombia and the region support the question of the new asylum policy
Fifteen states and the region of Colombia support a legal challenge of the new US policy which refuses to provide asylum to victims who are trying to escape from compensation or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the region submitted an amicus curiae report to Paris in Washington supporting a petitioner to challenge politics, said the NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Greek treatment in Secion, which was commissioned by the American Civil Liberties Union, has not been found in August against the federal policy.
She said that her "and his violent sons who are members of a conspiracy" had hurt her, but US officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was kept in Texas.
Citizens who support Greece have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries facing serious problems with compensation and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses the 2014 decision taken by the Intervention Committee (BIA) and has allowed illegal immigrants who avoid situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Secretary-General of the Colombia Region, Carl Rasin, said Parisian that the new policy "disavows all decades of political, federal and international law".
"In accordance with the federal law, all applications for asylum must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such a complaint violates this principle," said Amius curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that refuses access to immigrants violates the U.S. economy, suggesting that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "be able to carry out the necessary labour force".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Jesseons ordered the courts of immigration not to give any more asylum to victims who are trying to escape from situations of domestic violence and sanctions.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country of origin because of their expulsion or expulsion because of their detention, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," Sesion said in his statement on politics on 11 June.
The purpose of the serpent was never to solve all the problems (a voice and the most serious) that people face every day around the world.
Unknown rescue efforts in Paul, as the number of dead is doubled rather than the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was constantly deteriorating.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to recover her child who had been burned, at a concentration center that had been placed in the ruins of Paul's city.
"Every minute the patients bring other bodies.
The pure water shines."
Some of the residents were working to return to their destroyed homes and to collect their existing water, trying to increase what they could find.
Hundreds of people were also injured by the hospitals, who suffered damage from the 7.5 magnitude of Richard’s climate, were unable to cover their needs.
Some of the injuries, such as David Harris, who suffered from the middle and the cold, remained outside the Palo’s Military Hospital, where the first aid was given to the hospital because of the continued violent transmissions.
Dacriya had tears in his eyes, as he explained how he felt the violent silence to shake the room in the fifth floor of the hotel where he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to survive.
I looked at the walls of the building," Harris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then she fell silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope he's safe."
The U.S. prosecutor accuses China of "exhaustion" with "propagandistic declarations"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-year publication in a US daily newspaper oversupplying the double commercial profits between the US and China, the US president in China accused Beijing of using the American type to disrupt its project.
U.S. President Donald Trab mentioned last Tuesday at China Daily's launch, which appeared in Des Moines Register, the newspaper with the most sales in Iova's politics, after accusing China of seeking to interfere with the elections of the Congress on 6 November, a category that China rejects.
The Trab category that Pekino has tried to fight in the American elections marked what U.S. officials have said to Reuters that it is a new phase of the air-conditioning campaign that Washington has launched to put pressure on China.
Although it is not prohibited in foreign governments to publish declarations on the promotion of their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a climate-based trade war and have imposed a double standard of import duties.
China's tariffs in the beginnings of the trade war were aimed at attacking exporters in such cities as Iova, which supported the Republican Party of the Trab, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Brandt, former U.S. president of China and a long-term government in Iowa, a policy that is a major exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Brandon wrote in an article in Sri Lanka Des Moines Register, "describes this kind of fear by publishing propagandistic publications to our free press".
"In an attempt to reverse this propaganda, the government of China carries out the most valuable delivery of the freedom of speech and of the free press of America, publishing a payment of a publication in Des Moines Register," wrote Brandon.
"On the contrary, in the vicinity of Beijing, you will find at least exclusive voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on the Chinese economy, since the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers rejected the offer to publish," even though he did not reveal any.
The Republicans reject female voters in view of the inter-elections due to the festival with Cabano, warning analysts
As many proud Republicans continue to support the appeal for Supreme Court Brit Kavano despite complaints for sexual abuse, researchers warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, to the upcoming inter-elections.
The feelings on this issue are particularly intense and most republicans have said they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be recovered," said Grand Reyer, professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University in The Hill, regarding an article published on Saturday.
Reyer suspects that the move of the last moment of journalist Jeff Fleick (R-Arison) to request an investigation from the FBI will be sufficient to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and certainly they are not going to forget it in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, a top consultant and national representative of the leading group of MoveOn, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the speakers regularly called on the theme "November is coming!" on the way to Georgia, as the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission gave green light on the appeal of Cabano, other than Dr. Christine Blazi Ford's testimony, said Mic.
"Record's enthusiasm and motivation will reach a record level," said Stu Rodenberg, a political analyst, on the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of unconfirmed female voters and younger voters, aged 18 to 29 who, while opposed to the President, often do not vote."
Even before Ford’s public statement in which he described in detail her complaints for sexual abuse against the Supreme Court’s appeal, the analysts had foreseen that there could be a reaction if the Republicans went ahead with the money.
"It's a huge shame for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Commission of the Republicans, at the beginnings of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just for the vote on the committee or for the final vote, or for whether Cabano will be taken out. It has to do with how the Republicans dealt with the issue and how it was brought to its attention," said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Group of Priorities, who helped in the election of the Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somehow justified in believing after Fort and Cabano's statements, which appear to be more lenient than the second.
A new publication by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were sure or probably believed in Ford's existence, while 35% said that they were sure or probably believed in Cabano.
In addition, 38% said he believed that Cabano probably or certainly lied to his status, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Fleck's move, the FBI decided to investigate Ford's complaints and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
In the past week, Ford was right before the Russian Judicial Commission that Cabano was attacked while he was baptized when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez asserts that the applicant for the Supreme Court showed his general organs while they were at a party, when both of them were studying at the Bell in the 1980s.
The World’s Estuist plans to launch a new network to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the founder of the World Cup, started a startup with the aim of competing on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new plague of this technology is Inrupt, a company based on the open platform of Berner Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who can have access to what information.
In an exclusive meeting with the Fast Company, Berners Lee pointed out that the mandate behind Inrupt is the "world sovereignty".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology to allow users to create their "personal electronic storage space" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, hard work lists, journals, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a transfer program and all of this at the same time.
The only feature of the personal electronic data storage area is that it allows the user to decide who has access to any type of information.
The company calls this possibility "personalisation through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's leading consultant, John Bruce, is the company to offer resources, procedures and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to all.
The company is a security platform purchased by IBM, some agreed programmers working on the project and a community of volunteers.
This week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said that his own group did not talk to "Facebook and Google if they were allowed to make radical changes, ignoring business models in one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a press release in Medium that went around Saturday, Berner Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and a system that will protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the basis of the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berner Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Technology Institute of Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Berner Lee has had a strong voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely grateful for the next time of the Internet," added Berner Lee.
Bernard Van: A prize for a winner who won Victoria's World War A War · Global Voices
The only member of the Anglican Church who has received the Victorian War Force during World War A as a soldier was valued at the patriot 100 years later.
Prof. Bernard Van received the metal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglis and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a free target four days later and never learned that he had lost the highest British military distinction.
The Sabbath became the discoveries of a monumental plaque by his two grandsons, which was accompanied by a parade at the North Hamptonshire Rasden.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was an "excellent symbol" that the plaque's discovery became about 100 years after his father's ironic act for which he received the metal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the opponent Van led his line to the Canal of Sen-Kenten through a very powerful band and was shot by weapons of war and mobs."
Later, he went to the back line and with an "extraordinary man" led the line to the front before he hit himself with a weapon of war three times.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German freeman on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never get, it's something that makes you feel very respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also bought a chair after the break, led by the Islamic New Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that "he felt a great appreciation for his contribution" and added that "the man of a well-known hero is shown by the support he has from many people."
MMA's fathers had dinner to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Pope in Urunaki
Think about this scenario: you have had the evening to watch the favorite Bellator 206, but you are pleased to see this unique sporting event.
The program in San Jose included 13 games, including six in the main card, and would live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Mussai and Rory McDonald were ready to go to the ring, the players in the United Kingdom remained united when the show changed to Pepa in Uronaki.
Some were not happy at all, as they had remained awake until the first mornings especially for the fight.
One expert on Twitter described the childhood program as "some kind of a diseased ass."
"In accordance with the law, this content was not suitable for 6 in the morning, so the child programme had to be planned," said Dave Svarts, Vice-President Marqueting and Bellator's communications, when asked about the transfer.
"The Pope of Urunaki, of course."
Bellator's president, Scott Kockerer, said that the programme would be developed to include the United Kingdom's theatres in the future.
"If we think about the rivals, I think we can do them," Koker said.
"But it's six Sunday morning there and we won't be able to do it until our Lord's own hour, that is, their own Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change occurred, many messages were exchanged before and not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you the next time, something like this will not happen.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six, as we usually do, and we're trying to offer more to the fires and we're leaving it.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "lower" because of his sexuality
Olybinick of the divorces, Tom Daily, said that he grew up feeling lower than the others because of his sexuality, however, that moved him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until the gym that "not all are like me."
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs that Loren Laverne presented on Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of homosexuals to give the others hope.
He also said that since he became a parent, he is less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Jang, a regular representative of the known radio broadcast, was a few months away from the disease.
As a guest in Lavern's first exhibition, Daily said he felt "not enough" compared to others when he grew up, because "he wasn't socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
He said: "Even today, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and desire to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The second time, the Galician Olbyonicis is a community's champion of the rights of the Loathiki community and has participated in the late Communist Party in Australia to make an invitation, so that more countries can proceed to the self-identification of homophilia.
He said he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without any consequences, and that he wanted to give in to other "hope."
The three times the world champion said "it was a surprise" when a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013.
Daily married to Oscar Dustin Lance Black, who is 20 years older than he, but he argued that the age difference was never a issue.
"When you went through so much at such a small age" (he first met in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died three years later from cancer) "it's hard to find someone who has similar good times and bad times."
The couple adopted a son of June, Robert Rey Black-Delly, and Daily said he changed his "all his perspective."
"If you asked me first, I'd only want to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than the gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic metal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from cancer in the brain.
Daily said his father didn't accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if he had issued tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, Dad, you won't be close to us to sit in the first row," he said.
"I cut his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead I finally admitted that he was not innocent," he said.
The following year, Délie fought the Olympics in 2012 and won the steel medal.
"I knew it was what I dreamed of all my life, to fight in the ruins of the Olympic Games in my homeland, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of the first song, the Heart Small Proud, which had drowned him in his preparation for the Olympic Games and even caused him to become a rival.
The Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside of the mikelson will sit in the pago on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Millson will mark the Lord when he plays his 47th fight at Ryder Cup, but he should improve his performance so as not to remember him for the wrong reasons.
Michaelson, who has been participating for 12 times (number of Rectors) in the games that are held every two years, was forced by leader Jim Furrick to sit in the park for the fourballs and the foursomes of the Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as usual for the United States, five times the winner tried to meditate on the lines and "work" his game, hoping to correct his problem points.
Without ever having the most responsible driver even in the afternoon of his career, the 48-hour game is not suitable for Le Golf National's close field, where the remotes are often problematic.
And as if the Earth's difficulty did not come to an end, Michelson, in the same Syrian war, faces Francesco Molinari, British Open's president, who cooperates with the leading Tommy Fletgund to win their four games this week.
If the Americans, who were four degrees below the beginning of 12 singles, can take the lead with a good principle, the game of Michaelson can be of critical importance.
Furic expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He's got the full role he's playing today, hit me in the back, put his hand around me, and said he's gonna be ready for the morning," Furic said.
"He's got great self-confidence.
His name is in Hall of Fame and he has offered too much in these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him to play two games.
I thought more about it, but there we were, and we thought that we should dance.
He wants to get out there, like everyone else."
Michaelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most major games in Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of a career at Ryder Cup that didn't reach his personal record height.
Michaelson's got 18 hits, 20 hits and seven-months, even though Furic said his presence had a benefit for the group.
"He's funny, funny, spiritual, he likes to make jokes and he's outstanding in the group's audience," he explained.
"I think younger players were also having fun with him this week. It was funny to see him.
His contribution is not only in the game."
The head of the European team, Thomas Bourne, knows that the big obstacle can soon be lost
Thomas Bourne, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a big obstacle that starts from the singles of the last day in Ryder Cup can easily turn into this.
Danos made his debut in the battle of 1997 in Valderrama, where a team of leader Seveb Balesteros managed to win five degrees against the Americans, but only when he was able to cross the final line with different degrees, winning 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You always remember yourself that we had a great advance in Valderrama, we had a great advance in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only after violence," Bourne said, in the picture, after she watched the 2018 generation win 5-3 both Friday and Saturday and 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the story will show to me and all the members of the group that this has not ended.
We're going ready tomorrow to give them everything.
We'll get out there and play right.
Nothing's done until you see the sizes on the table.
We've got a goal to win this step, and we're running there.
I always say I'm interested in the 12 players of our group, but we know very well that there are also good players in the other group – the best in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult field of golf, Bourne adds: "I would not wish to predict the outcome.
Tomorrow is another building.
Tomorrow's measuring the personal impact and that's something different.
It's great to be in the field with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, then you're testing your skills as a golf player.
This is the message you have to send to the players, how to get the best out of them tomorrow.
You leave your companion behind and he has to give them all and show himself to the best of himself."
In contrast to Bourne, Jim Furrick from the opposite team would ask his players to note better personal performances than those they had with their partners, except Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who won three degrees from the four.
He himself has survived the two opposites of the revolutions of the last day, as he belonged to the winning group in Brooklyn before the unexpected era, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every song of his words," he answered when asked how Ben Crenso, the leader of 1999, had met his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brooklyn, like in Medinah.
When we get this round, there's a lot of pressure in the interlocutors.
We decide our series accordingly and we play with the series that appeals to us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has taken the lead in the war and is facing Rory McKilroy in the top game, with Paul Kessi, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fletgund and Jan Poulter, the other Europeans on the top of the series.
"I went with this group with this series because I think it covers all the way," Bourne said, justifying his choices for the singles.
New advance for Germany's new warship
The new flag of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the wounded warships of the nuclear wartime, but it is not to be taken up until the next year, due to misleading systems and the cost involved, mention the local means.
The position in the service of the Rhineland-Pfalz trainer, of the entire class of the Baden-Wuertemberg fleet, has been renewed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which calls for a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have been involved in the 2014 Marine War, but the delivery problems were certain for the success of the pilot project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that launched the 2007 War Navy will replace Bremen's oldest flagships.
They will bring strong rules, a series of anti-aircraft fires and fires on ships, as well as some steelth technologies, such as reduced radar, surfaces and audio signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance works is reduced, as it will be possible to use new brakes for up to two years outside German limantines.
However, continued delays mean that even if the warships are considered to be the last technology, which will allow Germany to demonstrate its power abroad, until they end up in service, it will already be over, says Die Zeit.
The evil F125 flag became a prime flag before, when the German warship was officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the ship after delivery.
A lot of information about the reasons for the return has not been known, but German media have referred to a series of significant "software and materials" that would put the warship in vain if they were used in a war mission.
The software problems were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships are full of about 120 ships, only half as compared to the oldest Bremen crews.
It was also discovered that the ship has a much larger burden, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future developments.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz flag is believed to have the double weight of the same class ships used by the Germans during World War B.
In addition to the automatic equipment, the cost of all the work (including the training of pay) has also been a matter.
It is said that it reached the estimated amount of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), while the original budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems confronting the new coasters are particularly important as Germany's maritime forces are being depleted.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartles, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, was admitted that the War Navy "will not have a ship for shipments."
The officer said that the problem was solved in time because the old ships were loaded, but there were no other ships to replace them.
It was concluded that none of the Baden-Wuertmberg class runners could be involved in the War Navy.
National Trust Covers the Night's Secret Life
A new research carried out in a building in the Netherlands of Scotland seeks to discover how nurses use the place when they follow their food.
The enlargements will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique mammals and will contribute to the planning of future actions for the protection of the environment.
The study of the National Trust scientists for Scotland will examine the habits of the common nanonichter and micronichteride, as well as the coffee of Dobeneton in Inverwe Gardens, West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at fire stations around the building to monitor nighttime activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out motivated research using malicious detection.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by experts will examine the frequency of nighttime calls, as well as what kind of behaviour they have.
Then a map of the site and a report will be created to form a detailed picture of their behaviour in climate.
Rob Duar, a natural environment protection consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are more important for the nighters and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of biofuel management, such as the creation of forests and the best way to maintain forests for nighttime and other related species.
The population of the nighters in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has been significantly reduced over the past century.
They are derived from building work and development projects that affect the parts where they feed and destroy their habitats.
The fireplaces and lighting are also dangerous, as are the college films for mice and some chemical transactions in construction materials, as well as attacks from similar cats.
Nights aren't really stupid.
However, because they follow the night, their eyes are more useful than their eyes to catch their soul.
They use an advanced audio recording technique to detect noises and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important fields and 76 000 land throughout the country, considers the night to be very important.
There are ten trained experts, who conduct regular research, inspect the parts where nighttimes are cold and sometimes cross over.
The organization has also created the first and only refuge of Scotland only for Nights in the Treave Mountains, in Dumfris and Galway, where eight of the ten species live in Scotland.
The bed manager, David Thompson, says the bed is the ideal place for nighttimes.
"Here in the Treave we have an excellent area for the nights," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many big trees and an ideal building.
There is still much we don't know about the nights, so the work we do here, but otherwise it will help us better understand what they need in order to increase their population."
It considers it important to take first control of the existence of nighttimes before each household maintenance work, since the destruction of one and only small wood could kill up to 400 indigenous and small people, possibly eliminating the whole local population.
Nights are protected species and are forbidden to kill them, prevent them or disrupt their safety, or destroy their forests.
Elizabeth Ferel, director of Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said, "There's been a lot of learning about our nights and many of our species just don't know the development of their population."
Ronalto rejects the complaints for rape, as his lawyers are ready to send a German newspaper
Kristino Ronalto described complaints against him as "fake news", saying that some "will want to be self-defensed" performing his name.
His lawyers are going to send the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The attacker of National Portugal and Juvent is accused of attacking an American named Katrin Magiorgka in a hotel room in Lake Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, she had spent $375.000 in order to buy her jewelry and not to mention anything about the incident, she told Der Spiegel in Paris.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram at 142 million times after the complaint, Ronalto, 33 years old, described the references "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time winner of the Black Cross in the camera.
"They want to self-defense and use my name.
It's normal.
They want to be marked using my name, but this is part of my work.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the player laughing.
Ronalto's lawyers are ready to send Der Spiegel to the allegations he published, which have been described as "an unacceptable reference of letters that affect private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Kristin Scherts said the player would ask for compensation for "a relatively low level of severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of private life in recent years."
The alleged incident is that it occurred in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a dinner centre, Ronaldo and Magiorgka returned to the player's room, where he was brought back to work on the records of the District Court of Clarke in Nevada.
Magiorga claims that Ronalto fell to the knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was in "99 percent" a "good guy", but he warned the other "one hundred".
The documents state that Ronalto is likely to have sexual contact, but that he was sensitive.
Magiorga also claims that she went to the police and hospitals where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because "he was afraid of possible obstacles" and worried about her "public execution".
The 34-year-old says he is trying to reverse the arrangement, as he continues to suffer from a transformation syndrome due to the alleged situation.
Ronalto was willing to take a transfer to the Madrid Reel from Manchester Yuandid at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer turned to the Italian Juvents by ensuring an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will always move the loss of car industries"
The United Kingdom "will move forever" if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, said the Minister of Enterprises Greg Clark.
He added that it was "responsive" that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its workshop in Bernadette, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automotive industry said that the impact of cross-border delays in Brexit would be possible without agreement to cost jobs.
The workshop in Bernaston, where the Auris and Aventis models of Toyota are manufactured, offered almost 150,000 cars per cent of which 90% were sold in the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain departs from the EU at the end of March, production will cease at our workshop," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's Director Council in Bernadette.
And other automobile industries in the United Kingdom have expressed fear of EU exit without agreement with regard to cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said that it will close Mini's workshop in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern risks to the supply chain in accordance with the car industry in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line is followed by just-in-time. Replacements are received every 37 minutes by suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars manufactured after order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the borders, resulting in delays and lack of resources according to the sector.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to keep a loan after one day at her workshop in Derbysair, the company said, so the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Tereza May's project on future EU relations "to address cross-border controls in particular".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success but also use this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The information that comes not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is necessary to ensure the continuity of the necessary oils."
Toyota was not able to say how hot it would stop production, however, warned that in the long term the additional cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Chuvallaris, who works here for 24 years and is the Union's co-ordinator at the workshop, said that the members of the body are more concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never be reimbursed.
The representative of the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trab's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, reports the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trab with the Deputy Secretary-General Rod Rozenstein can "reverent another week", as the debate continues for the appeal at the Supreme Court, Brit Cabanno, announced that the White House is on the Syrian side.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Recruiter Robert Miller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, the ties of the Thrab's assistants with Russia and the possible conflict of justice by the President.
The possibility of Trab solving the supplemental General Entrepreneur, endangering Miller's independence, is to feed into Washington's pockets here and for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of having a daughter to record his talks with Trab and make it possible for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
However, last Monday, I went to the White House through reports that it was intended to be abandoned.
On the other hand, a meeting with Trab was announced on Friday, which was then held at the United Nations Organization in New York.
Trab said he would "prefer" not to release Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to agree with the hearing procedure before the Committee on Legal Affairs of Georgia in which both Kevin and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
The President-in-Office instructed the FBI to conduct a study within one week on the allegations against Cuba, thus delaying further voting by the whole of Germany.
Sarah Sanders, a Trab-type representative, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
I asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, saying: "There has not yet been a date, perhaps this week, but perhaps another week of data from all other cases involving the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, otherwise I like to always inform the guy."
Some journalists have responded to this statement: Santer has been making a type information in the White House since September 10th.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of information was not due to the "printing" of television journalists, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are shown".
He then left it to mean that there would be an increased or direct communication between Trab and the type.
"The President gives more consultations than any previous President," he said, adding, without adding any information: "We have looked at these numbers."
They will continue to make information, Sanders said, but "if the guy has the ability to address direct questions to the President of the United States, that is exactly better than talking to me.
We try to apply it often and you see that we often apply it in the last few weeks and it will take place where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trab often receives questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or type meetings with official visitors.
The individual consultations of the type are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is happening, with an anti-consuming and sudden alternative appearance before the concentrated journalists.
The Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health System through fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to the citizens of the EU who are working in the Scottish National Health System to express their gratitude and to welcome them to remain and after the United Kingdom was released from the European Union.
Jean-Friman, a Scottish Member, sent a letter while there were fewer than six months to leave the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to cover the cost of applications for a permanent residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mr. Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on discharge and lead to expected decisions on phytosanitary.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom has also taken action to prepare for a possible non-compliance scenario.
I know that this period must be especially difficult for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each official in respect of nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that support and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home everywhere and we really want you to stay here."
Cristion Abercrobi is submitted to an urgent surgery after a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers team's advocate was sent to an emergency surgery after the head injury in the Sabbath battle, where the Tennessee State Tigers were held with a score of 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by the newspaper Tennessee, Mike Organ.
Tennesse's prime minister, State Round Reid, told reporters that the injury occurred a little earlier than a day ago.
"He came to the pago and just dropped out there," said Reid.
The gymnasiums and the medical staff gave Abercrobi oxygen to the bag and then put it in a unit and carried it back for further evaluation.
A director of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV TV station in Nasville, Tennessee, that Abercroby came out of the surgery at the Water Center Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there is no "a lot of information about the type/extension of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrobi, a secondary student under a limited participation regime ("redshirt"), extends the first season to Tennessee State after his translation from Illinois.
He made five total tuclins on Saturday before he left the game, thus reaching the 18 total tuclins for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher credit for the assets market in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher credit for the assets market in the United Kingdom, while the additional financial amounts will be used to provide assistance to the needy, in accordance with the new Toris plans
The measure will ensure the success of the Corbin campaign to bring young voters closer together
The increase in final taxation will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Economics expects it to collect up to 120 million pounds of English per year - to provide assistance to refugees.
Foreign buyers will start to pay higher credit for the assets market in the United Kingdom, while the additional financial amounts will be used to provide assistance to customers, as Teresa May announced today.
The measure will be regarded as an example of the success of Jeremy Corbin's army to attract young voters with more economic savings commitments and the target of seniors.
The increase in the end of taxation will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional financial amounts will strengthen the government's campaign to combat the lack of interest.
The increase, imposed at the current end of the grant, together with the higher tax rates introduced two years ago for the second-home market and housing, can be reached by three per cent.
The Ministry of Economics expects that the measure will amount to up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of young people in London are purchased by people who are not residents of the United Kingdom, leading to price increases and making it more difficult to get the first domestic buyers into the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially the original - have become "full-eyed" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy is introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the final rate so that more young people could get their first home.
He assured the large manufacturing companies that he had kept the prices of the high prices of the raw materials, taking over the land without, however, to use it and invited Mr. May to abolish the ceilings in economic housing in order to restore Britain's "freedom of energy".
Mr Corbin has proposed a series of impressive six-way reform proposals, including internal controls and prevention of "responsibility" emissions.
It also encourages greater powers in the councils to build new houses.
Mr. Mei said: "I told Persisi that I would rely on my ministry to restore the British dream - to improve life for every new generation.
This is due to the introduction of the market for solvents.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies who built abroad to buy houses the same as the hard workers in Britain.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the need for lack of a home remains abundant."
Jack Ross: "My complete ambition is to lead the Scottish team."
Sanderland's leader, Jack Ross, says his "complete friendship" is to become a trainer of the Scottish national team at some time.
The 42-year-old Scotseys is encouraged by the challenge of stopping the group of North-East England, which is currently located in the third position in the League One of England's Football Category, three degrees below the top.
He moved to Foto's Stadium on Wednesday, after he had previously returned St. Meren to the Scottish Prefecture of the previous competitive season.
"I wanted to compete for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team, and that was "Ros told the Scottish BBC on the Sports Sound radio.
"But I grew up seeing the Scottish team in Habden after my father as a child, and that's what always took me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I have success in providing groups."
Among the Russians in the Sanderland are Dick Andvokat, David Mogias, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Nil, Roy China, Gus Poguet and Paul D. Canio.
Aloa Atletic's former teacher says he didn't feel guilty when he was invited to make so many names available to such a large group, having previously rejected connections from Bernsley and Ipswiit Taun.
"At this moment the success of me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question "Can I bring this group back to Premier Lig?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this group, it belongs to Premier Lig," he said.
"It's not easy to get her there, but I'm probably going to think of myself as successful here only if I can bring the group back there."
Ross started his career as a teacher just three years ago, having spent a period of time as an assistant trainer in Dbarton and a 15-month period in Hart's preparatory staff.
He then helped Aloa to return from the assignment to the third category and led St. Meren from the assignment to the establishment of the Initiative in the next season.
Also, Ross says he feels better now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartpool, Volkerk, St. Meren and Hamilton Acanthemicol.
"It was probably a real road," he said encouragingly to take the position of Aloa's teacher.
"I really believed it made me feel more like I'm a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because I've gone well, I've earned enough money from this, and I've got pretty high enough.
But playing can be hard.
You have to face a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having trouble with the lack and pressure of the job, but my teacher's work is completely consistent.
I always wanted to prepare myself and now that I do, I feel better than I felt with myself all my adult life."

The best time for beer is at 5.30m on Saturdays, according to research.
The hot gas boosted the profits for Britain’s tested dads but brought greater pressure on the restaurants.
The fathers and the bars noted an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, as revealed by the figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA's consulting company, who concentrated on the data, said: "The continued lightness and greater than England's expected participation in the World Cup was the result of July to follow a similar tradition with the previous month, June, where the profits of the popes increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants continued even larger.
The decrease by 1.8 percent in the income of the restaurants in June simply led to July.
Fathers and bars who serve alcohol have gone far better, with the corresponding figures of the previous years being higher than those of the respective restaurants.
Fathers serving food also served the sunning days, although not as active as restaurants.
Looks like the world just wants to get out for water.
In all managed fathers and bars, oil sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Niuman, of the RSM company's intelligence and friendship analysts, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of important social or sports events remain major factors in the area of sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that the number of restaurants continues to be difficult, but the decrease in sales by 4.8 per cent per cent per year will be particularly causal data of continuous cost pressures.
The long summer summer could not have been seen at a worse time for businessmen in the station area and the time would show whether the lower temperatures we have survived in August would give a multi-scaling spread."
The overall increase in sales to fathers and restaurants, including new businesses, reached 2.7 per cent of July, reflecting the distortion of trade names.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales indicator for the United Kingdom’s pop, bar and restaurants collects and analyzes data from 47 active groups, with a total working cycle of over 9 million lines in England and is the set point of reference for the company.
One in five children maintain secret accounts in social networking, hidden by their parents
As research reveals, one out of five children - even 11 years of age - maintain secret accounts in social networking, hidden by their parents and their teachers
A survey of 20,000 Gymnasy students revealed an increase in the fake Instagram pages.
This indication stimulated fear that sexual content is being abused
Twenty-one percent of the students said they have a "master" account to show their parents.
One of the five children - even 11 years of age - create accounts in social networking, which are kept secret by adults.
A survey of 20,000 Gymnasian students revealed a significant increase in fake Insta accounts - it is a reference to the Instagram photo notification site.
This indication impressed the fear that sexual content is being abused.
Twenty percent of the students said they keep a healthy "primary" account to show their parents while keeping private accounts at the same time.
A mother who had successfully found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a trap that enabled others to beat her ("be with").
The study conducted by the Digital Awarenss UK and the School Directors and Directors Board (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of the students from 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them admitted that they kept secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Biuanan said: "It is disturbing that so many refugees are forced to create Internet sites where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Ejlind Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Council of Staff
Ejlind Doyle was appointed as an executive adviser to the Scottish Council of Staff at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most popular actor in Scotland, and President Jan Bity has taught her choice as a great opportunity for those who lead the crime to benefit from her wide international experience over the last decade.
"Ejlind enjoys a deep respect for the whole of the Scottish, British and global society of Steve and we are sure that the pillar in Scotland will have a great benefit from its membership in the Council," Betty said.
Doyle said, "I am encouraged to be the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help lead the conflict in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, had won a total of four Olympic medals and is more regular in BBC, remained a year after a pre-existing active genome.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a headache.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show me how much I'm going to break.
It was exciting, but I was completely tired, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing opportunities!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
In the case of a child, a child must be given a child’s right to a child’s right to a child’s custody.
A parent company has broken down the online public opinion with a declaration comparing mothers who are pregnant with girls who share them.
In order to launch the so-called "world-first atrophied and worn glass", Elvie's consumer technology company has circulated a humorous release inspired by a video clip to show the freedom that it offers to pregnant mothers to the new tower.
Four real mothers dance in a garland full of honey, with a song that includes sticks like, "Yes, I respect myself, but you don't see any sky" and "If you haven't noticed, these are not matrixes, they're my eggs."
The choir continues: "Take it, take it, kiss it, kiss it, kiss it, kiss it, love my ladies."
However, the publication, published on the company’s Facebook page, has brought online feedback.
With 77,000 previews and hundreds of comments, the video has exposed minor reactions from theatres, as many say it does not take seriously the "frank" of the milk industry.
"It is a very unfortunate decision to use needles to publish this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies steal them a few days after birth" someone said.
Elvie's roof is divided into a toilet (Elvie/Matera)
Someone else said, "It's apparently harmful both for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to publish tents for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added: "A statement completely other than reality."
Others were surprised by the announcement, while a woman was admitted that her song seemed "disqualified."
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy a glass like that if I were still lying.
The shock made me feel exactly like a bear.
The announcement is a little bit boring, but I didn't let it go.
It's a smart product," someone wrote.
Another school said: "It's a strange statement that targets mothers who have breast milk (slowly in their workplace or in toilets) and feel like "swifts".
It's not about advertising that upsets or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that they were all laughing at the different lakes lying inside their roofs.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who have breast milk say they feel like rats.
The Elvie Valley, however, is completely untraceable, has no rings and no holes and separates itself into a tidal pool, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even get out during pregnancy.
Anna Balarin, co-chair and Executive Director of the Ministry of Culture at Mother, said: "The Elvie Valley is such a resurgence product that has earned him a thormous and exciting launch.
By making a comparison between pregnant women and lactating rats, we wanted to focus on the removal of mother milk and all the challenges it has, at the same time showing in an interesting and relative way the incredible feeling of freedom that will bring the new island.
It's not the first time Elvie has become a prime minister.
During the London Week of the Week, a mother of two children appeared at the parlor for the design fashion Marta Yakubovski while using the product.
One-hundred children of immigrants were moved to the border of Texas
The number of children under the detention of migrants has reached the highest level, although the monthly limit limits remained relatively stable, in part because the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the administration of the Trab made it more difficult to respond to children with conservators.
Traditionally, most observers are also immigrants themselves without travel documents and are afraid to go ahead and ask for a child and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was compounded in June when the federal authorities announced that the powerful conservators and other adult members of their home would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the transfer authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior staff member of the Ministry of Migration and Customs, announced before Congress that the service had taken tens of people who were asked to care for orphans.
Later, the service confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had a white criminal record.
"At least 80 percent of those who are either guardians or members of the guardian's home are in the country anonymous and a large part of them are other criminals.
Therefore, we continue to exploit these people," said Mr Albens.
In view of the speedy transition of children's cases, the officials introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before a court within one month from the start of their state and not within 60 days, as they previously did, in accordance with refugees.
Many will appear through an expert conference, in the position of self-representation, in order to develop their powers to provide a legal regime before the judicial authority for matters of transfer.
Those who believe that they do not meet the conditions for exemption will be immediately dismissed.
The more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be beaten or depressed, which may lead to violent breakups or withdrawals, according to refugees and with reports from the system in the last few months.
Consumers have said these concerns are involved in larger facilities such as Turin, where it is more likely that some children will find it more difficult to avoid being distracted because of the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the cinema without being given enough time to prepare their children psychologically or to relax their friends could damage the damage they already have to do.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish 'holding forces' to be immediately removed
In charge of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Wallem also called on the Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war in the country is still on for a long time.
Mualem, who also serves as a complementary prime minister, said that foreign forces are inextricably located in a desert area, in order to combat terrorism and "to take appropriate action."
"There must be immediate and high conditions," he said at the meeting.
Muelem continued that "the war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 330,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been displaced from their homes.
He said that the Damascus will continue to "give this sacred war until we break all the Syrian terrorists" and from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily educate and inform both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Basar and Asand.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the area of the country's war.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions were good for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "a variety of fears" that encouraged refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Politicizes a question that should be purely humanistic."
The United States and the European Union warned that aid would not be granted for the reconstruction of Syria without a political agreement between Ashand and the conflict to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a decommissioned zone in the last major republic of the rebels in India created the opportunity to promote political talks.
The Russian agreement has allowed an extensive attack by Russian-supported military forces in the province, where three million people live.
Muelem, however, regretted that the agreement had "explanatory deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target Gychantists, among whom and fighters from the association with Al-Qaida Metopo Nusra, who would be "extended".
The Special Representative of the United Nations Stefan de Mistura hopes to bring together soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the Government and the opposition to the establishment of a Inter-Bolitical Constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for the elections.
Mualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Turkish Government in the Committee, saying that the Committee's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no intervention should be made.
Why Trab will win a second date
With this logic, Mr Trab will win the 2020 elections again unless, as many liberal poets hope, the proposal for a model and the scandals will soon end its presidency.
Something that would undoubtedly be "The most active fan of all time!"
Up to now there are no signs of the teasing.
Since 2014, television numbers in the high-television area have been exceeded by reaching 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million in MSNBC.
The Fox News TV network has an average of 2.4 million TV users in the high-television area, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC release "The Rachel Maddow Show" has recorded television numbers on television, with 3.5 million TVs on important nights.
It's a fire to which people come because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Bauer, a manufacturer of the ABC Action Series "Designed Survivor" where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys Capitol.
Nel Skovell, a leading comic book writer and author of the book entitled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
It is remembered a trip on a trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her driver said he'd vote for Mr. Trab.
He asked why?
"He answered "Because he makes me laugh," Mr. Scowell told me.
There's someone who can even have fun with the chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is happening to the television series, scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy case against White if immigrant families can also improve the health of the world economy.
The change of frequency is a diversity that only the most privileged TV users can enjoy.
However, beyond the definition of the informed citizen when you are in six hours to watch a special group discuss the use of "multiple meetings on the platform" by Bob Woodworth for the book of "Fear" ("Fobos"), Paul Manaford's bombjacket from the face of a 15000 dollar coin ("a full cup of beer", according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the smooth descriptions made by Stormie Daniel's contacts with his daughters.
I, however, will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What makes and gives you the feeling of your rival is that he gives you something every night," said Brad Montgomery, a leading counselor of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the TV program "Pawn Stars" about the constantly changing actors and daily objections to the Trab show (starting fire with N.F.L., calls Kim Young Wyn).
You don't have the ability to lose any cause, otherwise you stay back.
When I met Mr. Flais this week, it was a Sunday day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his house on the north coast of Hawaii, but he was locked in view of MSNBC while the CNN was migrating.
It could not have been easy, not when Brad Kavano was about to stand before the Committee of Justice of Georgia and the future of the United Justice was stolen from a locker.
"I remember we made those bad old exhibitions, and the world said, "This will mark the beginning of the end of Western culture," said Mr. Flaiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were finally right."

External money goes into the most limited analysis of the intermediate choices
It is not surprising that the 17 electoral region of Pennsylvania in Congress is receiving a flow of funds, thanks to the restoration of the electoral regions of Congress, which has put two members of the Congress at the same level.
This newly redesigned pre-accession region of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lab, who was expelled from other regions in special elections held before the opening.
Lab has another active representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, representing the former 12 electoral region of Pennsylvania, which is largely composed of the new 17 electoral region.
The maps were reopened after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled in January that the old regions were acting in opposition to the interests of the Republicans.
The electoral review in the new 17th electoral region has launched a financial competition campaign between the largest financial sections of the parties, the Democratic Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republic of the Republic of Korea (NCRC).
Lab became a public in Pennsylvania after he had won a limited victory in a special election review held in March for the 18-election region of Pennsylvania in Congress, followed by many people.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trab won the region for 20 degrees.
Political analysts give the Republicans a clear warning.
The United States examined whether El Salvador could be punished for its support in China, but did so back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing bitter reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trab had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Barella in June 2017 and maintained a hotel in Panama until the partners informed the management team of the Trab Organization.
The officials of St. Dipartementt decided to summon the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "precise decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore", as Heder Newer said earlier this month, the representative of the service type.
However, the imposition of sanctions was examined only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received approximately 140 million US dollars as US aid in 2017, among others for drug, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in economic aid and targeted restrictions on passenger visas, would be sufficient for the Central American country, with high unemployment and human rights.
As the internal meetings developed, the officials of North and Central America referred to a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic well-being, followed by a corresponding concentration that had taken place in the last country, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the transfer of appeals to the United States.
In mid-September, however, most administrative officials made it clear that they wanted to proceed to the meeting, giving a substantial end to the views of the tax evasion in El Salvador.
President Mike Pens is going to be addressed to the meeting, which has already been scheduled for mid-October, indicating the importance of the conference on governance, as the diplomats said.
And the three American refugees returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House by Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultations, under the terms of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst located near the administration, who also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Read History
The next item may be the report of Special Council Robert Miller on the violation of justice by Mr Trab, for which very strong evidence has been published.
It is reported that Mr Müuler has also turned his research into possible consensus between Mr Trab's pre-election campaign and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress is changing hands, Mr Trab will find a solution before this body, as he is ready to reconvene the president in the next elections and perhaps before the jury.
"Yes" is a lot, and I do not think that the fall of Mr Trab, nor of his counterparts in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge during this war.
In 1938 German officials were ready to act against Hitler, if his East had been opposed and supported by the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the murders that followed.
The ruins of history are turned around by such places of camp, and the security of democracy is shaken or persecuted.
The Americans are now faced with enough of these camping points.
What would we do if Mr. Trab dissolved the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rozenstein, the man holding Mr. Miller's research in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he wrote in that paper that last year he suggested that the president be written secretly and that he considered him inappropriate for the position of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the deal adopted by the Times was an objection.
"How will we answer if the applicant's investigation of the F.B.I. is not complete or fair or if it is established in the Supreme Court in addition to the basic categories of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will put Mr. Trabb left?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a far-fetched realm.
But, because of the lesson I've learned, I think we won't succeed.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever taken refuge in my presbyterian home.
He lived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later he sent me to fill a chair of the Hebrew Sabbath to that table with the swastika.
With this heritage, how can I not be grateful for our future?"

Graham Dorans of Reinzers is grateful for the fight with Rapind Vienna
Reinzers supports Rapind Vienna on Friday, knowing that the victory on the Austrians, after the impressive isolation in Spain with Vigarial earlier this month, will give her many prospects for a victory from the 7th Group of Europe League.
An injury in the bone prevented the middle of Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until the island with score 2-2 with Vigiaral, but he believes that Reinzers can use this as an excuse for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Vigarial is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We went to the game believing we could make something and we went out with a degree.
Maybe we could run away at the end, but, in general terms, isolation was a possible legal result.
It was probably the best in the first half and we were the best group in the second half.
Now, Friday is another big European night.
Well, we can take three degrees, but it's going to be a hard game because they did good at their last game, but, with the world at the stage, I'm sure we can put our powers and bring a positive result.
The past year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and changes made to the same group, but there is a positive feeling now.
The group is good and the kids enjoy it, the preparation is good.
Let's hope we can put our strengths now, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of condominant retirement
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they would like to be interviewed, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were discussing with their spouses about the cost of long-term retirement.
Only 10 percent said they've talked about this to their children.
"People want to take care of their family, but they don't take the initiative to engage in the discussion," said Holly Snaper, president of the National life insurance company.
Start with this.
Talk to your wife and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes too much earlier.
Work together with your council and your family to discuss where and how to get attention, since these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Give your financial advice: Your advice can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your long-term financial options may include a traditional long-term pension insurance, a hybrid life insurance at a market price to help you cover these costs or security with your own property - you have enough money.
Order your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a full account of health care issues so that you can determine a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals will comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also, collect as much as you can to do as you can for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on economic matters by your side and ensure that your accounts are paid, in case you become unsolicited.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing a serious health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and alternatives?
Please refer to these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only are the economics the issue, but who are the doctors?" Martin was asked.
"Who are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you prepare for this project."
Andreas received many guns with a gun at Ilfrakob
A man received a lot of guns with an airplane as he walked to his house last night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxsford Groub region of Ilfrakob in the Devon County, when he was shot in the neck, neck, and hand.
The police described the event, which took the country at 02:30 B.C.E., as a "lucky event".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not dangerous for his life, and the police call for witnesses.
Syndrome and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that destroyed the Indonesian city of Paul in Paris, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With the communication to stop, humanitarian aid forces have not been able to obtain information from Dongala, a region in the north of Palu, located close to the centre of the 7.5 degrees of the Rixter climate.
In Palau more than 16,000 people were evicted after the disaster.
Some important information on the island of Sulaeze is provided on the island of Palu and Dongala:
The palace is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located outside a narrow hill on the west coast of the island of Sulawezi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was on the 40th floor when the earthquake and the tsunami hit it.
Donegala is a resistance that extends over 300 miles (180 km) of the island of Sullawezi.
The anti-government, a level of administrative separation below the principle, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main foundations of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donegala.
The extraction of nickel is also important in the process, but it is more in Morouali, in the opposite direction of the Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Anti-Fraud Anti-Fraud Service.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Sunami also struck the western Donggala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Sasmoid Valley of Fire in the Northern Ocean and is often hit by lightnings.
Some of the biggest recent tsunamis and tsunamis are the following:
2004: A massive earthquake in the western part of the Indonesian province of Atsech in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226.000 people along the Indian Ocean map, while over half of them were in Atsech.
2005: A series of powerful strikes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of May and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of dead in the Nile River, near the shores of Sumatra.
2006: A total of 6.8 degrees of the Richter climate closed the southern part of Yavas, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 degree set of Richter’s climate with a centre near the city of Pantang, the capital of the eastern West Summit.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 degree peak of Richter’s climate ended one of the Metau Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed tens of villages and cost about 300 lives.
2016: A small-scale earthquake struck the area of Pindi Jaja in Athens, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the destruction of the 2004 deadly tsunami and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed in buildings that died.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the island of Lompok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sara Peillin's firstborn son was brought up for domestic violence
Trak Peillin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and candidate for the President Sarah Peillin, was gathered for attack.
The 29-year-old Peilin, from Vasilla of Alaska, was brought up as a witness to domestic violence, a complaint against domestic violence and opposition to the principle, according to the report published on the Sabbath by the police (Alska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance was forced to call the police to charge the crimes she was brought to deal with, she got her phone off her hands.
Peilin is temporarily held in the Mat-Su temporary detention schedule, guaranteeing an amount of 500 dollars, as mentioned at the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday, where he said "surely, innocent" when asked, as the network says.
Peilin deals with three category A offences, which means that he can be sentenced to one year's imprisonment and a financial fine of $250,000.
It is also awarded for category A premium, which is paid in a day-to-day and fixed-term amount of $2,000.
It's not the first time there's a criminal offense against Peillin.
In December 2017 he was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Pellin.
His mother, Sarah Pellin, called the police to charge the attack.
The case has already been brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was subjected to categories of domestic violence, a complaint against the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of weapons, while he was in a state of emergency.
His companion insisted that he had her crunched in the face.
Sarah Peilin was criticized by Western groups in 2016 when she joined her son's violent behavior with a transformational grueling disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Syndrome and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people lost their lives after the earthquake that struck the island of Sulawezi in Indonesia in Paris.
The 7.5 degree magnitude of the Rixter climate caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have stopped, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake hit close to the center of Sulawezi, located north-east of the Indonesian prime minister, Jakarta.
In social networking, a video is circulated from the time of the disaster.
Hundreds of people had been assembled for a holiday on the beach in the city of Paul when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutors call for the newly executed death penalty for the prospect of a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty in Saiful Saifof, the suspect for the terrorist attack in New York that cost the lives of eight people - a rare punishment that has been imposed in the federal crime policy since 1953.
Saipoff, aged 30, was brought up to use a rental truck from the company Home Depot to take an attack on a train along the West Side railway in Lower Manhattan on October 31st.
In order to justify the death penalty, investors should prove that Saifov killed eight victims "by Will" and caused serious physical damage "by Will", according to the death penalty declaration issued at the Court of Justice of New York.
And these two categories speed up the death penalty, according to the paper.
Weeks after the attack, a federal gang brought Saipofo against category 22 categories, which included eight categories of humanity for criminal organization, a rule often applied by the federal prosecutors in organised crime cases and a category of violence and car destruction.
The attack required "a significant design and prevention", the importers said, describing the way Saiff had ended the attack as "stupid, severe and severe."
"Saifulo Habibulavits Saipof has caused road damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clives, An-Lor Decant, Darren Derrick, Ariel Erlich, Erna Ferutsi, Ernan Diego Mentosa and Alejandro Damian Panuko," as mentioned in the statement of preference.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Court of Justice of the South Region of New York committed an act of murder.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to a similar death in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was imposed on a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the marriage of Julius and El Rozenberg, who were executed after being sentenced to a conspiracy for the execution of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
And the two Rozenbergs were executed in the electric car on June 19, 1953.
Saipoff, a citizen of Uzbekistan, appeared uncondemned in the days and months following the attack, according to legal documents.
He told the critics that he felt satisfied with his action, according to the police.
Saipoff told the authorities that he was compelled to end the ISIS video attack he saw on his cell phone, according to the charge.
He also asked for ISIS's significance in his hospital room, according to the police.
He was innocent of the 22 categories listed in the category.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saifoff, said that he was "suffly disappointed" with the decision of the Intangible Authority.
"We believe that the decision to be asked to impose a death sentence instead of accepting the declaration of equal execution with no possibility of detention would simply extend the damage caused by the events for all involved," Paton said.
The Saipof's defense team had previously asked the importers not to ask for a death sentence.
A member of the Toris says that NAITZEL FARTZ should be head of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Fardz decided to "movify the people's army" today during a protest conference at the assembly of Toris.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians should "feel pressure" from Europeans, as one of Teresa May's Members said he should be head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Bowen told the exhibitors in Bermigham that the United Kingdom would "have already gone" so far if Mr. Farage was responsible for Brexit.
But the challenge Mr Mei faced in her attempt to agree with her deeply-deserved Members was emphasized by the fact that supporters of the EU's stay in Toris participated in a separate anti-Brexit concentration in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the Czech Conciliation Plan under control through attacks by Brexit's superiors, EU and EU permanent residents.
The Contests continued to move with her efforts to reach agreement with the Brusselsians, despite the reactions and to persuade the Europeans and the Workers to choose between her package and the "haus".
Mr. Bowen said at the Controversy Concentration of Leave Means Leave in Solichal that he wanted to fly "the Czechs project".
He said that he should have been given a title of kindness to Mr Faraz and that he should have been entrusted with responsibilities for negotiations with the Brusselss.
"If we were the head, we'd have already left now," he said.
The Member from Weilingboro added: "I will support Brexit, but we must defeat the Czechs project."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to become subordinates.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bowen rejected the allegations that the common opinion had been amended by the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British people have changed their mind and wish to stay is completely true."
The chief of Brexit's member of Toris Andrea Jenkins was also in the exhibition and said to the journalists: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Czechs project does not have the acceptance of the broad community, the opposition is not going to vote, it does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who go down the streets and choose us below.
Please leave the Czechs project and start listening."
With a powerful message to Mr May, he added: "Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraz said at the Controversy that politicians should be forced to "feel pressure" if they are willing to present the decision adopted by the 2016 resolution.
"There is still a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to give Brexit and we're here today to tell them "We won't let you kiss her if you do that."
In a message to the encouraging crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are willing to offer Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We are moving this country's people's army that has given us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, prime and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, EU asylum seekers appeared in Bermigham before a free concentration in the city centre.
A few activists joined the Torris against Brexit after the group's meeting this weekend.
The Member of the Working Group of the Adonis welcomed the Conservatives for the security issues that had been dealt with by a party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"They are the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technical means needed for the EU type-approval agreement. – Any investment, for the unforeseen borders, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a totally natural one.
It doesn't mean good Brexit added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of voting for the Presidency
American journalist Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider the possibility of voting for the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper says that the President of the Republics from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during the conference at the West Massachusetts headquarters on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trab, commends his election to November, contrary to the Republican representative of the town of Jeff Dil, who participated in the Trab campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is urgent that it can be reversed with Trab in 2020.
The exhibition on Saturday morning was her 36th meeting with voters using the building structures of the mayor since the Trab ceremony began.
A speaker at the conference asked her whether she was planning to vote for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come "to go to Washington women to build our dissolved government, which means that a woman must be found in the top."
Collection for the deadly bombing of the LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rouge of Los Angeles announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect for the deadly bombing of LSU White Sims in Paris.
The police department of Baton Rose announced the arrest of Diton Simpson, 20 years old, at a press conference at 11 μm (Easter Zone Time).
They had published a video of the bombing of Paris, asking for help to identify the man who appeared on the video.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot dead near the University of Southern University early in Paris.
"Wide Sims suffered a head injury, which led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday, according to the 247sports website.
Weind invested in protecting his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Sibson was rejected and admitted to being found at the point of possession of his gun and alleged to have shot White Sims.
Simson was arrested without opposition and detained in the Police Department of East Baton Rouge's community.
The third-year student Sims with a height of 1,98, who grew up in Badon Rose played 32 games, with 10 performances as the main player in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Gran Prei of Russia: Louis Hamilton goes for a world title, as his team's instructions gave him victory over Sebastian Fell
It became clear from the moment that Baltire Bots passed before Louis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the fight.
At the airport, Bots had a good start and almost hit Hamilton, as he was impressed by his position at the first two turns and called Felt to be hit by his mob.
Fatel first went to the party and let Hamilton run into the sky of the cheese, something that should be definite.
Mercedes went to the party a little later and left the hotel, but Hamilton went out after a race fight, which forced Ferrari's driver to suddenly abandon the internal cause of the risk of double movement in violation of the third round.
Max Frestapen began his last position and was seven at the end of the first round today of his 21st generation.
He then remained the first for a large part of the fight, as he kept his fingers in order to finish quickly and pass through Kimmy Raconen's fourth position.
He finally went to the streets on the 44th floor, but he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Raconen came to fourth.
It's a hard day because Walter was fantastic all Saturday and he was a real boss who let me pass.
The group went out of it and did it one-two," Hamilton said.
The body language was very bad.
President Donald Trab briefed journalist Diane Fainstein at a conference on the Sabbath for her conviction that she did not delay Christine Blazi Ford's letter, in which he accused the Supreme Court of Brit Kavano of sexual assault.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president was not directly mentioned in the statement made by Ford before the Committee of the Legal Affairs of Georgia, speaking against this fact that the people in Russia proved to be "simply and deceitful and liars."
"The only thing that could happen could also happen this beautiful thing that happens in Russia the last days, where you see the victim, you see people who are angry and mean and stupid and lying," he said.
"When you see advertisements and advertisements and then they call you "yes, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Fainstein, did you break up?
Remember her answer... you dropped the document-- "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Well, a minute.
If we're late... no, we're not late," added a little bit to the grower.
Fainstein received Ford's letter containing details about the categories against Cavano in July, and it dropped early in September - but Fainstein refused that the delay came from her office.
"I didn't clear Dr. Ford's categories, I didn't break her story," said Fainstein to the committee, as stated in the newspaper Hill.
"He asked me to keep her away, and I kept her away as he asked me."
But her refusal did not seem particularly to say to the president, who attended during the Saturday conference: "I'm going to tell you something, the language of the body was very bad.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to support the appeal for the Supreme Court, which was accused of three women for sexual harassment, the President left it to mean that the Republicans use the categories to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take the power back using any necessary means.
Look at the chaos, the innocence, they don't care who hurt, who have to travel to get power and control," said the president according to the editorial website Mediaite.
Elite Lig: Dandi Star 5-3 Belfast Jaids
Patrick Dwyer put two balls for the jeans against Dandy.
Danny Stars made an explanation for her daughter in the Battle of Paris in Elliet Lig by Belfast Jaans, winning the Raven with 5-3 on Dandy on Saturday.
The Jaands took a easy shot with two balls with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowier's sweat.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauni brought the island to the farmers before Dwyer restore the jeans.
François Busar compared Dandy and then two bullets from Lucas Lundwald Nilsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third summer in Elite Lig in the season for Adam Kiff's men, who came with a victory with score 2-1 on Danny in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth class meeting between the two groups, with the Jaandes winning the three previous games.
Dwyer opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Central Macboll's seat, while David Raderford gave the essay in which Bovier doubled the sentence four minutes later.
In an adequate period of complete action, Sullivan put the earthly team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the essay for the equation from Kanuni at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advance for Jayants on the first day when he got his second round for the night at the end of the first period.
The group of geologists was shaken, and Busar was re-exacted with a wave of force at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Korkeran joined their forces to help Nilsen deliver the lead to Dandi for the first time in the war to the end of the second period and he won the fifth round of his team in the middle of the last period.
The Jaands, who have already lost four of the last five games, are playing in their building with Milton Kens in their next battle in Paris.
An air traffic controller loses his life in order to freeze hundreds of aircraft passengers off the coast
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, as he lost his life in his attempt to ensure the safe relief of an aircraft that carried hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many are ignored because of a massive earthquake that struck the island of Sulaeze in Paris, causing tsunamis.
Strong transfers continue to plague the area and many have been caught in ruins in the city of Paul.
However, even though his companions had intended to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonis Gunwan Aung refused to abandon his position at the control fire that was moving, at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport of Palo.
It remained in its position to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then located on the rescue route, could be safely withdrawn.
Then he pulled out of the control fire when he thought he was gone.
He died in the hospital later.
Air Navigation Indonesia's representative, Johannas Sirett, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, as he transferred Australia's ABC News TV network.
We prepared a helicopter from Balicapaan to bring him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Paul.
"We're confused with his death," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the dead can be thousands, while the country's disaster response service indicates that access to the cities of Donegala, Sigki and Butong is limited.
"The number of dead is believed to be rising again, as many bodies are still under scratches, while many of them have not been able to reach them," said the representative of the service type, Sutopo Puño Nogorho.
The six - foot - long [six - meter] gates destroyed the palace, which would end with a massive slaughter of the Lord’s sheep.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Reza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute a patient brings bodies.
Clean water is low.
My markers are lying all over."
Jean Gelfand, president of the International Star War in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Indonesian Star fights to save survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
President of Indonesia, Joe Wyndonto, came to Paul on Tuesday, and said to the army of the country: "I ask you to work nighttime to complete any work related to the origin.
Are you ready?" passed the CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier a year ago by tsunamis in Lompok, which cost more than 550 lives.
Mapping in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the crash of ships in Limin
The air carrier who made a flight to a river of the Interior in Micronesia now reports that a man is missing, while earlier he said that 47 passengers and payees had safely canceled the aircraft in question.
Air Niugini in a press release said that from Saturday's morning it's not possible to find the pictures of a man in charge.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information on the carrier, such as his age or nationality.
Ships in the area were helped to relocate passengers and crew after the aircraft was lifted into the water as it was attempting to reach the airport of the Black Sea.
The authorities told Paris that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable.
The causes of conflict and the exact balance of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane was added to the airport outside of the approach route.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was trying to reach the destination.
U.S. officer Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"That's very good," said Jane.
Jane said that he and others were able to move forward through the water that came to them as a means to the emergency exits of the flying plane.
He said that the air meetings had been staged, and they were crying, and he suffered a severe head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that some ships working nearby for the improvement of a mine were also helped in the detonation by using a cargo ship to transport people to the coast before the ship was landed at about 30 feet (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none of these conflicts have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the night's schedule where a woman lived
The complainant's ruling ended her arrest on Saturday at the retrial trial of a man who was charged with the death of a woman from Egypt in 2014.
U.S. Ministry of Justice Analyst Paul Roulette set up hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the Indians how he used mobile files to track the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Roulette said he got location files from several mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Cheiber on the night of her death, lying to his previous claims, as the newspaper Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Cheiber's cell phone the time he claimed to be with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sasford set up a witness on the Sabbath and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the charged authority asked him if Telis told the truth that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said, "he lied because my truck was in Nasville."
Another objection was that Telis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The mobile files showed that they knew only one week.
Roulette said that some time after Cheiber's death, Telis wrote the messages, calls and communication data from Cheiber's phone.
"He wrote it out of his life," said Hill.
The defense is about to begin its occupation of the Lord.
The judge said that he considered that later that day the case would be brought to trial.
The High Breed: What's the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to question the negative view it has of the species, filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, by Bristol, claims that the hip hop has escaped from its roots, which were political messages and the response to social issues.
They want to return to his tracks and make the conscious hip hop public again.
As well as the Fugees and Commons, they have a recent rebirth in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
And another black one?
Dana in New York sends a couple who ran her off, after she got a "racist" message.
A dance from New York is being held in marriage for a racist solution after the message that her mother had mistakenly sent, where the last one claimed that the dance was "another black person."
The husband refuses to be racist, comparing treatment with "extreme" treatment.
Linsie Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when she found out that the new Aunt Joel Morris was black, while the last one appeared for the first day of the work in 2016.
"OHYIAIIAIIA ALL RIGHTS," wrote Mr. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr. Morris twice.
As soon as she discovered her ship, the Amishana more Mr. Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mr. Morris, saying that their superior Danta, which was an American, had not done anything good and was waiting for the seat of a Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Mr. Morris received compensation for one and a single working day and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mr. Morris has taken a treatment against the marriage seeking compensation for the divorce and has paid compensation for the amount of $350 per day for the extended work period as an internal dance for which he was originally invited, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," said the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's about discriminatory treatment."
The couple objected to claims that they were racist, saying that it was reasonable to resolve Morris, as they feared they could not trust her again after they joined her.
"My husband sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not a rapist.
We're not rapists," Mrs. Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had attacked, even wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now."
Looking at treatment with "exhaustion," Plasco said his wife was born just two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"Would you follow someone who is in this situation?
It's not that kind," the bank investor added.
While the legal case was in progress, the Court of Justice of the Common Opinion decided to condemn marriage in the media of social networking, condemning them for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Pandington feared that the appellants would not be interested in an archaeologist speaking, as revealed by a new letter.
Bud's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born a little after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into someone who read it for the first time before his release.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the great success of Pandington."
She said that her father, who was working as a psychologist in BBC before being inspired to write the child book from a Lutheran archduke, was grateful for his work, adding that the 60th year of the release of the book was "glycopic", as her father left his life behind.
Regarding Pandington, which he described as "a very important member of the family", he added that her father was blind to his subsequent success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't surprised."
"But because Pandington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who corrects something: you're proud of it even though it's not your own destiny in reality.
I think that's how he saw Pandington's success.
Although he was creative himself and his imagination, he always gave the impression to Pandington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to tell her face on the phone.
After the surgery, her daughter was transferred to Nikais Louis Paster 2 Hospital, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nand then called me and told me that he was very bad, that he didn't have much hope of achieving it," said Mr. Andnan-Laperuz.
"At some point, Nand called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to leave her.
And I did.
I said, "So, I love you too much, honey.
I'll be right back.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given her to keep her life’s heart freshly dried and removed from her body.
He had already died a few hours before that time, and now they're all set up.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it all happened.
I couldn't scream, cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should've been cold."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far fled for her daughter's sake, survived the plane along with the other passengers who have ignored the test she's been in.
"No one knew it," he said.
"I've had my head down and they've been running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was in the plane, he made me feel comfortable about Nand.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women who suffer the loss of their own persons carry cards in their pockets to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones in suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Saron Davis and Kelly Hamfreys are sleeping in a corner of the whale's map with inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call anyone to receive support.
Mr. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a very promising boss, with a traditional smile.
"They all knew about his smile.
They've always said his hammock shot the room."
However, he left his job before he died, as "he was in a very bad situation."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he finished his life.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm pretty worried there's going to be an impact."
Mr. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there where you can go and talk, even if they are your friends.
Don't be shy - you have to talk."
Mr. Hamfreys, who is a friend of Mr. Davis here for many years, lost Mark, at her 15-year-old cousin, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt tired or depressed or something like that," he said.
"A few days before the Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had caught up with the Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look at them in the eyes."
He said his death caused them a terrible tragedy, but they must pass it: "He heals the family.
It's against us.

The future of Brad Kavano is uncertain, as the FBI is starting research
"I thought if we could actually succeed something like what she asked - a limited length and limited object research - we might be able to bring a little unity," said Mr. Flyk on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be resolved by a partial agreement.
Why did Mr Kavano and his Republican supporters not want to conduct an investigation with the FBI?
Their incontinence is entirely due to time-consuming.
The intermediate elections are only five weeks, on 6 November and if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, they will significantly weaken their efforts to make the choice of the person they wish at the country's highest court.
George Walker Bos calls the Georgians, urging them to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bos and through this he met his husband, who was the personal writer of Mr. Bos.
What will happen after the FBI's report is added?
A vote will take place in Georgia, which is currently 51 republics and 49 republics.
It is still not clear whether Mr Cabano can take at least 50 votes in Russia, which would allow the President, Michael Pence, to take the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean wastes falls under Kim's authority
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Young One arrived in power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, providing data from the South Korean Ministry of Integration, said 1.127 instances have been reported last year, compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the highest charges of mobile persons were a major factor.
Penguin has not made public statements.
In the structural prosperity of the remnants from North Korea, the territory of South Korea is finally offered.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border unnamed since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them operate through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross in comparison with the heavily protected Austratic Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers illegal immigrants to be illegal and often ignores them through violence.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are typically still in war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Piongang to discuss the negotiations on abortion, which have been delayed.
This meeting was followed by a historic meeting between American President Donald Trab and Kim Young Wen in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate in a broad manner in the eradication of the Korean cancer.
However, on Saturday, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Rim Johng Il charged American sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"With no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions, in no case will we leave our country solely for the first time," said Mr. Rim in his address at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozi calls Brad Kavano "sister," says it is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
The President of the Republic of Poland, Nancy Pelozi, appealed to High Court Brit Cabano "serious" and said that he is of the same nationality as an invalid to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelozi made these comments at a meeting on Saturday in Texas Tribune Festival in eastern Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman was treated in this way, they would call her "heretic" in the speech of Poland on the case of Cabano before the Committee on Justice of Georgia on Friday.
Kavano, with a strong movement, refused the allegations that he had committed a sexual attack on Dr. Christine Blazi Ford when he was both of the fugitives.
During his appropriate purchase, Cabano was very upset, and he almost cried and we heard him speak about his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned the democratics to the Committee, characterizing the categories against him as a "territory and coordinated political killing character", organized by volunteers who have forgotten the fall of Gilary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelozi stated that he believed that the situation of Cabano showed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as he had shown that he was prejudged against the republics.
"I think he himself has withdrawn himself from these statements and in the way he has committed himself against Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelozi responded when asked if he would try to submit a complaint against Cabano if his appointment was confirmed and if the Republicans were to receive the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then it's not only appropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves at this time," Pelozi said.
Kavano is a judge in the Regional Office of the Region of Colombia (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pélozi added that as a Republic, he was concerned about the likely decisions of Cabano concerning the Act on the Affordable Care Act or the Russian case against Weind, as a conservative judge.
In the hearing discussions on the confirmation of his appointment, Kavano refused to answer questions if he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time to go to court for an old, pretzeled man and wait for us to say, "It's not great?" Pelozy said.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified spell, months, and years of surgery that fail and can't get it out of the inside without crying.
"We cry when we remember," said Mr. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
He kept saying, "It helped me very much a woman who was in control somewhere, who said that she cried when she died, but had developed a technique that when she smiled and started to cry, she said to the person she was saying, "You may think I'm upset because I cry.
I'm angry."
And that's how he just kept going.
And it seemed extraordinary to me."
Degrees are allowed as part of the organ in part because they are based on pre-defined.
One of my most intimate memories of an old job I did in a office where men were leading, is once I cried out with an unquenchable voice and I was dragged by a bigger woman - a smart manager who was always afraid - and she took me to a school.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said to me.
"They don't know you're appointed.
They think you're upset and they'll be happy because they've caught you."
Patrice Srenter, then a Republican governor from Colorado, had cooperated with Gary Hart in his presidency campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested to have a sexual relationship with a ship named Monkey Business (Brumudulence) and ended the battle, Mr. Srenter, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason to consider the idea of setting the same candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he told me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the choir, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone described the situation as "The Xionate and the Seven Snows."
Because the campaign had already started here a long time ago, it was back in funding and so it was decided that it would not go to the polls if it had not collected $2 million.
The fight was lost.
He discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave it to $250.
"Do they think I have a disappointment?" he asked.
In her speech in which she announced that an official campaign would not start, she was very enthusiastic with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to concentrate money and to target voters rather than for representatives and men with sex - who joined a party in the race.
"You'd think I had a neurotic cloning," recalls Mr. Srenter about the reactions of the guy against her.
"You'd think Klenex was my company donor.
I remember thinking what they're gonna write on my phone?
"Screaming"?
How trade war between the United States and China can do good in Beijing
The cheerleaders of the trade war between the United States and China were exorbitant and while the war still has a great deal to end, a solution between the two countries can benefit from the long-term Beijing period, the experts say.
American President Donald Trab stopped the first warning campaign earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese export products, including solar panels, coal and aluminium.
This week, the biggest climate was created by imposing new taxes on US$ 200 million (150 million) in the amount of half of all products imported into the USA from China.
The Pekino returns the fires every time, while recently it introduced taxes of up to five to ten percent to a cost of $60 million.
China is determined to withstand American fires, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to bring it down soon.
In order to make Washington subject to his demands, he would have to comply with their demands, but to publicly support the United States would be too embarrassing for Si Jining, China's president.
However, according to experts, if Pekino could play his cards correctly, US pressures in the context of the trade war could be positive for China long-term with the reduction of solidarity between the two economies.
"The fact that a basic political decision, whether in Washington or in Beijing, could create conditions for economic recovery in any of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers in the past have accepted," said Abigail Grace, a researcher with an Asian study center, at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is ready for the sudden return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of the country's seventh (and more) war.
Speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Al Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore stability.
All the conditions are now met for the sudden return of refugees to the country they were required to leave because of the terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their privacy and biodiversity.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since 2011 when the war ended.
Six million other people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Mualem said that aid for the reconstruction of the damaged country is acceptable to the Government of Syria.
However, he regretted that he would not receive aid under conditions or aid from countries that supported the enlargement.
Europe's key to victory in Küllo Reinter in Paris
The group of Europe won the Cubello Ranger 2018, nesting the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the golf field Le Golf National, outside Paris in France.
The American team has been joined 6 consecutive times in European territory and has won the Küllo Ranger in Europe since 1993.
Europe took the first place again, as the Danish leadership team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 degrees needed to defeat the United States.
The U.S. team's star, Phil Millston, who fought hard in the biggest time of the tournament, threw his ball into the water at the par-3 16th floor, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player of Golf Molinari captured all of his rounds and thus became 1 of the 4 players who had achieved 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Speth was held at the 57-4th of the lowest in the European team's board of players, Dano Thorbgiorn Olsen.
The player with the world's best rank, Dustin Johnson, succeeded 2 and 1 against Jan Potter from England, who could play the last game in Küllo Rainter.
Spain's eight-year-old Cyprus Ranger, Sergio Garcia, was the most successful European of all times in the tournament with a total of 25.5.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't keep it.
It was a difficult time.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we took back the cell.
It's all about the group and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the dog to John Ram's co-conspirator, who won the American golfer Tiger Hunts 2&1 in a solo game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible breaths that I beat Tiger Judds, I grew up to admire this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Junts also lost his four games in France and now has a career record at Küllo Ranger 13-21-3.
I've been statistics for one of the biggest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and only Jack Niclaus has passed it.
The U.S. team has been trying to find a goal all Sunday, except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf all over the tournament.
American leader Jim Farick spoke after his group's disappointment, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
Sometime this morning we pressed Europe enough.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a big leader.
And the 12 players played him very well.
We will resume, I will work with the US PGA and the Cypelle Rainer Commission and go ahead.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to accept it.
They were better than us."
Information about the red age: The concentrations are reduced in the areas of Pinelas, Manati and Sarastota
The latest announcement by the Florida Committee on Ithnosis and Animal Life shows a general decline in the concentrations of Kokkini Palirios for parts of the Taba region.
According to FWC, the conditions of immunization are observed in the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kolier, which indicate a reduction in concentrations.
A copy of the Kokkini Palirios is distributed in about 130 miles from the northern part of Pinellas to the southern part of Lee.
Cylinders are found about 10 millimetres of the square of Hillsboro, but in smaller points in relation to last week.
The Kokkini Palace has also been observed in the Pasco province.
Measuring concentrations were recorded in the area and open to the area of the province of Pinella last week, low to high concentrations recorded to high levels of the area in the province of Hillsporo, sub-groups to high concentrations in the province of Manati, sub-groups to high concentrations in the area or open to the area in the province of Karasuta, sub-groups to moderate concentrations in the county of Sarlot, sub-groups sub-groups in the population and groups of adults in the population.
Inhalations in the respiratory system continue to be recorded in the provinces of Pinellas, Manati, Sarastota, Lee and Kolier.
No disturbances were reported in the respiratory system in Northern Florida last week.
