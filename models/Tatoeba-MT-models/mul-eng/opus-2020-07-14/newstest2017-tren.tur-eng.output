28 Watching the World 30 From Our Readers
A 28-year-old thief who was transferred to San Francisco recently died this week at the funeral of a local shopping center.
But the victim's brother did not think that he could harm him. He said, "The works were good for him."
San Francisco Adli, a 28-year-old San Francisco Adli, who was in Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning, explained that he was identified as a member of Frank Galicia.
San Francisco Emniyt told the Department that the cause of death was identified as a murder and continued research.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia, U.S.A. station in San Francisco, told KGO that Frank, who had previously worked as head of the department in Boston, began working as head of the department in San Francisco Sons & Daughters six months earlier.
The finals & Daunters expert stated that this death "has turned into regret and has been so sad at last."
The speaker said, "A small team working here like a hard family will be very disappointed."
We would like to point out that Frank's family was not alone in this difficult time and that our prayers were with them.
Louis Galicia mentioned Frank's stay in the hostels at the beginning and said, "It was going well for him."
Louis Galicia said to the KGO, "He held a room and went out with a girl."
Louis Galicia said he didn't think he could be someone who might want to hurt his little brother.
He was a man with a strong heart. He was a kind person.
The way to build a family bond is always to prepare us a cigarette, make us eat." said Louis Galicia.
He never liked to talk.
My brother, I've always been in good shape.
He said, “When everything in the world is in error, it is not a thing that has been done in the morning.”
The information owner requested that he call the SFPD Ihbar Line from the phone number 415-575-4444.
Asian doctors in grav: New calls for slowing down
The representatives of the Asian doctors requested that the trade unions be allowed to slow down their work with regard to a new agreement.
The Association of British Tables (BMA) called on the General Council to support the process of expediting more work than at the beginning of July.
JDC said they didn't have any concerns about the conversation.
Asian doctors and trainers used a retaliatory game in an agreement with BMA.
This was rejected by 58 percent of the members who voted.
In a letter published on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt stated that the government had been "suspendly silent" on the issues that led to the rejection of the government's agreement.
He said, "In the light of this, the JDC Board of Directors used the game to totally reject the proposed new agreement, and called for a re-examination of the debate on concerns."
The JDC administration has found an official request to allow a program to be approved by the BMA Foundation for the extension of its work from the beginning of July.
Inconsistencies, the reason for the involvement of the assistant doctors in the first group in NHS's history was that six greves were included.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the assistant doctor at BMA, used as a follow-up to the terms of the BMA agreement.
The 54,000 assistants said that during the meetings before the teacher gave a presentation, the BMA members had a good deal to accept.
After the event, Dr. Jeremy Hunt said that he would be able to apply the terms of the contract to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Is there a 'unsanitary'?
It was a disaster that ended.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey came together to announce that the eight-month war, which was fought on Wednesday, was completed in symbol of the eight-month war.
But when I greeted the Turkish community at the exhibition hall of Vladimir Putin St. Petersburg, I found that Ankara was the most distant side of the country.
The hand was heavy, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile was very weak, and he couldn't say that any heat was spreading against his own limited standards.
Instead, Recep Tayyyy and Erdoğan mentioned "good friend" from Mr. Putin, five times according to a report.
I was surprised.
He also promised that the relationship with Russia would not go back to a level before the crisis, and that it would reach a much higher level.
The next day, a newspaper here said that Mr. Erdoğan was acting like nothing bad.
I think his soul was showing the exact opposite of that.
But Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader didn't forget anything.
In fact, the first thing he said in his opening statement was that the crisis was the reason that Turkey would not be able to strike Russia's war flight across Syria.
At that time, the limit of Russia was full.
Mr. Putin, he accused Ankara of shooting down Moscow, making a tough exit.
It was a lot bigger, it was thought to be a friend.
It will be difficult to rebuild confidence in real meaning, perhaps impossible.
This has changed the thinking of the Russians since November.
In the state control, Ankara was targeted by media, moonscrapers and attackers.
Aniden, everything's been the crime of Turks.
The most serious of these were the charges brought against the illegal oil trade carried out in the areas under the control of the Islamic Government in Syria by the family of Mr. Erdoğan.
He certainly refused it.
But the official message that came out of St. Petersburg was the way it's time to move on.
However, the fact that this meeting was carried out was that Mr. Putin was denied the request from President Erdoğan.
Russia can see it as some kind of ugliness.
The benefits of the fire call for Ankara are very good.
First of all, Erdoğan needs friends after a short time that we've been able to realize and that he's about to be ruled.
The terrorist attacks in Turkey also affected her very much.
And the economic reasons.
Russia's actions were frequent, especially the announcement of a number of millions of Russian tourists to Turkey's villages each year.
This number fell almost 90 percent.
In Russia, it was very comforting to know that the flights will continue.
They're in a situation that's tied to the end of the season in the Aqden.
And this week, the government's TV, the Turkish press's license to re-examine their products, and the product's prices.
If we're going to get a news report in the Vedemos newspaper, "Tourists over there, domates here."
But your visit was of special political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the fact that it is not enough for the given threshold.
In addition to the long-term anger that has been fueled by the slow pace of the negotiations with the United States, Mr. Putin, who wants to use his connections to the West and from the distance.
Russia's leader seems to have gathered guests from Ankara for the purpose of the call for support of selected experts following the entry into force of the Russian leadership.
It must be remembered that he too was an inevitable trap for Moscow, who had a profound fear of the revolution.
This monument, which is built on this visible building on the seabed, is an analysis of Russia's and Turkey's "inspired silence" that explains to me: it combines the two countries that rejected the West and committed evil.
Despite the appearance of this remoteness, they are very different from each other.
One of the most important things about Syria is that Moscow supports the different sides of Russia and Turkey if it shows itself as a driver.
After almost three hours of the first meeting, he supports the fact that two others at the press conference did not change this subject.
When Turkey's President specifically refused to raise a question about these differences, Mr Putin chose to draw the bottom of these.
There is no clear consensus on how the partner country will be identified in Syria.
But months after the clear debate -- and when the Nato member of Turkey was in the middle of a positive turn of events, the Russian warplane hit Turkey -- it was certainly a good thing to start speaking with at least two leaders.
The Swiss Kingdom Bank is missing for customers outside of Iceland
The RBS mark, according to the head of the bank's executive office, will go to the back office.
The Kingdom Bank of Iceland will be lost for customers outside of Iceland.
Ross McEwan said to BBC Scotland that the RBS market is linked to the global objectives of the bank.
About eight years ago, he was in a state of shock to be released and released.
In the meantime, brand strategy experts have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial markets.
This was supported by millions of stars for many sponsors to Wimbledon Andy Murray's six-year-old champion.
But now it was decided that more national brands would be right.
The Swiss Kingdom Bank will only be used by Scottish customers, but new starters will not be made.
In England and in Galler, all letters made to RBS, other than in the concentration and prison, will be changed as NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is currently used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands that will carry out a much more pressing task for the United States Bank; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave a report on a class organised for customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
BBC told Iskoshia, "We're going to be a bank with more brands than we're going to be anymore."
As the bank itself became a global market, RBS became a global market.
It's not global anymore, I'm saying it's our local goals.
Each of these brands will move in a slightly different way in the population, and our staff will work under the names of these brands.
The RBS explained that the Six-year-old champion would not pursue his sponsorship and that he would raise the profile of different brands in the field of sports sponsorship.
The executive director said, "Now it's time for us to get to the bank's understanding of brands because (we asked ourselves) how can we do this better for customers?"
We're gonna be a great bank for our customers three years ago, and if we specified we'd take these brands off, I'd have found it.
But I think you're going to see a lot of changes with focusing on the needs of our clients, not our work.
We can reroute these brands, so I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori won 3,000 times the prize he won in Newmarket with Prediction
Dettori opened the champagne after he reached 3,000 in Newmarket with double success.
Jokey Frankie Dettori won 3,000 prizes in Newmarket on Friday.
On the ground floor, John Gosden was trained to win his second victory at night with Prediction.
Italian, 45 years old, is the sixth jokey on this mile.
He's following Mr. Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
And before that, the three champions in Ghyyar said, "This is a special situation."
I felt so much about my family being here.
I'm really happy to be in Newmarket 30 years ago.
This isn't an important meeting, not a Royal Ascot -- just a Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and relieved.
Dettori accepted the offer by bringing the Prediction after the funeral
In the morning, there were two joggs that reached this mileway: the champion jokey Richard Johnson and 20 times the champion, and a full-fledged jokey of Sör Anthony McCoy on 4300.
Lester Piggott, who won Derby's battle nine times, found 4493 in the career of Lester Piggott
Frankie, it's not surprising that one of our best jockeys and only a few miles away from a ship that a few people have reached before.
A man with a kind and strong personality is a tactical science that has elements that make it harder to print on the earth than others.
He represents himself in an amazing way, and he's been drawing people for years with his life and career in this area.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that it would only be possible if he wasn't a fighter at the end of the week and the big competitions.
To be serious, Frankie spent a large part of the 30 years fighting in the United Kingdom with the dragons that were so beautiful to see.
He has a very exciting character and a very good personality for these English contests, but it's also an amazing jokey.
Frankie Dettori praised this stone a mile from the iconic state with an insemination movement
Of the contests that he completed, with many movements of foot-and-mouths, with many movements of foot-and-mouthing, Frankie Dettori, for half a year, the English-in-angered runners became the symbol of the English-in-angered race.
It was a clear, unambiguous road.
In 1996 the famous 'Great Christmas' fair in Ascot, which included many great competitions, survived in a plane accident and was charged with failure to comply with medical law.
Three years ago, during the six-month period of separation, he showed that he had a strong character in order to cast his doubts out of his mind and make the best of his life.
And it could go on for a while, and then Dettori said he wanted to continue fighting for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin took my special word from Sergei Ivanov
Russia's President Vladimir Putin, my special address was taken from Sergei Ivanov in an unexpected way.
Mr. Ivanov has been a part of the close environment that Mr. Putin's trust has been in for years.
At 63 years of age, he was now assigned as a special representative for environmental and transport problems.
In an explanation made by Kremlin, Mr. Putin was quoted as "the decision to end Ivanov's responsibility for the administration of Russia," but he was not given any reason.
Mr. Ivanov has been assigned to this position since 2012 by Anton Vaino, who has been in charge of this since.
Vaino, 44, is an old diploma.
In 1972, Estonia's president was born in Tallinn, a member of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and was responsible for Tokyo's greatness.
The presidential protocol and the administration of government personnel were subsequently addressed; the comments on the Kremlin website are in this way (Russia).
After his assignment, Mr. Putin said, "Thank you for trusting me."
I think that the most important reason for the administration is to support your activities as the head of the government in the exercise of the law and the application of the instructions.
Mr. Putin explained on Friday that Mr. Vaino wanted to be removed from office by Mr. Ivanov to the Russian television channel.
The jokes are convincing?
It's a ghost that's amazing about Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been working as one of Vladimir Putin's closest advocates for a long time and has served the KGB for Soviet security forces like him.
He was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin and published on state television, both stated that they had been dismissed by their own will.
However, despite the horrors that have been presented to the cameras, very few people have been convinced of this, especially at this time when Parliament's elections were near.
And is it a misunderstanding that comes from this kind of fighter?
No one yet knows that.
However, the official explanation of a person who could be the president of Russia's environmental policy at once was highly questionable.
According to Kremlin's website, Mr. Ivanov addressed Mr. Putin in a general manner: "In the beginning of 2012, it's hard - even difficult - for four years, I want you to trust me for the task.
Well, it looks like I've been in office for four years, eight months.
Mr. Ivanov, it was held in mid-2011.
He's already been in charge of the chief's assistance and defence service.
He is a former member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the KGB security forces such as Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Putin appointed Mr. KGB as head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), who took the place of Mr. Ivanov.
When Mr. Putin passed away, Ivanov was one of the five most trusted.
Mr. Putin's third term was thought to be the president after Mr. Ivanov's second time.
But this task was entrusted to Dmitry Medvedev, another close friend of Putin.
Mr. Putin was president three years later before he returned to the president.
The year-old Thomas Gibson of the Criminal Minds series was arrested after he hit the manufacturer.
Gibson, our last month's church was protected from a physical battle in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who was over the structure of the directory, heard that he had been fired from work in a joint statement.
Gibson, who inspired Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Tuesday before his confession.
There were differences and misunderstandings about the subject of creation.
One of them said, "I'm sorry that such a thing is happening."
In ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, a group of characters playing Gibson's will determine how to get out of a program that monitors the FBI.
Previously, the 54-year-old actor in Dharma & Greg's status committee, who took part in the program since the first season of 2005.
Gibson said, "I love criminal Minds on Friday, and I've been working on my heart and soul for the past 12 years."
I wanted to stay until the end, but it's no longer possible.
I just want to thank the writers, writers, actors, our great team, and most importantly, the best supporters that a program can have.
The program is expected to return to screens on 28th September for the 12th season.
A group of fish in the Banff tree
A man living in the Banff district was in a helping application to identify the fish that emerged in the Banff forest.
Kevin Bain, he thinks this 75-fish can be fished with my seabed.
Bain, a 500 m away from the sea, was released in Periscope with the hope that some of them would keep their fish light in the middle of two river lengths.
Queensferry Passion: The Cross is now connected to Fife
The project of $1.35 billion needs to be completed by May 2017.
The believers united the north of Queensferry's Pass, and this means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four steps between the four sides of the table that are about to be completed around each of the three corners of the bridge.
Most of it comes from Fife at 600 meters long and 30,000 tons.
10,000 tons of coal and 20,000 tons of concrete are made of 46 base cables.
The project of $1.35 billion needs to be completed by May 2017.
Economics Captain Keith Brown became one of the first people to visit today's banks from the map to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry.
We're all witnessing in the real sense that the distance of the wall is actually the distance of resistance to the building of this part of the building on 30,000 tons of concrete.
Despite the amazing size and weight of the closed door between the door and the wall table with Vijadik, a hard work that will require the final touch tolerances for this suit.
In general, in almost 79 % of the total wall table, the concrete piece of the first piece of the table is going to be realized in Rosyth today, and this will mean that the entire table will be set on top of the wall.
Forth Travel and Montenegro's project director Michael Martin said: "In all bridge projects, the first stop is always a mile away.
This amazing project, this closure, the construction engineering, is a prelude.
We had to close the space on the north-west-west-west side after the location of the last coral reef table and connect to the extended North Pole level.
And this was achieved by being thrown to the sun up to 700 millimetres in the north.
It was a very big, but it was a very sensitive process at the same time.
The reason he grew up was that at a distance of 222 feet [222 m], he had to be almost 6,000 tons of weight, and he had to be removed at approximately 3% level.
The reason for this was that the team's tolerance values were very low; they were only a few millimetres on both sides.
Whatever it was, it's all right.
Moelfrei Corfezi rescue team: Three men's lucky to be alive
Three men, after they fell off the fishing boat in England, were lucky to be alive.
The Moelfre RNLI branch office was announced at 13:20 on Friday after seeing the accident in Moelfres Corfezi.
Three men were trying to get to a safe area while the boats were moving on their own.
Moelfrewre, a cancer control officer, said, "We saw the technology drawing straight lines to them, and we were worried."
"How could we then avoid them, unless we are rightly guided?"
When two of them were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man in his 60 ’ s was caught in a battle without being killed.
They were all taken to the cancer center, and brought to the cancer center.
Mr. Jones said, "Happy are the three men who fell down on you because they were alive and never hurt.
There was an emergency stop cable on the train, but it must have been stolen by someone using the boat when the ship was under construction.
These three men were watching people today.
A valued recreation type for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's really amazing to see how the world changes.
It was a sad situation for many of us over the past ten years.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move away from the cane.
When she spent time watching screens, she was exposed to video games and finally to smart phones when she was confined to her head TV.
That's why it's really great to see that technology and open air are not the things that's going on.
Of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, an application that was created for the main video game in the '90s (later turned into the line charts, the game cards and other later products).
Like a lot of populace culture, this new game was joined when it was burned in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Later, water was consumed in other countries as a result of the heavy load on servers.
In days more than Pokémon Go Tinder and almost the same number as Twitter.
So how does he work?
If you have to explain briefly, the players will call Pokémon, using their smart phones, and then, as followed by GPS, and they can't take a picture of what they've found, or they can't.
The game was joined by this crazy guy out of the cane for a family call that was playing when he was younger.
The game in the U.S. game has provided a significant increase in the number of steps a person takes every day.
Cardiogram, who was developed for Apple Watch, and followed 35,000 users, recently said that the person who spent 30 days in the service of Washington Post was up to 53 percent a day.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go; it's only possible to see the data.
It was observed that the majority of people, who encouraged the "30-minute break of time", "out of the cane" and "every day to be active," were concerned about the complexity of the health message and the spread of it by the people who looked suspicious.
But it's not as important as your exercise.
In general, people who do not exercise may lose the chance of cancer or depression.
He has a long list of advantages in matters such as solar, kilo-control, high-than-diabetic, and he's got a long list of options that he won't be listed here.
But Pokémon's beauty is to get out to do what people like.
In this way, there are three basic elements of health: movement, clean air, and sunlight.
Some people can even make new friends during the summer.
As always, there are unplanned players calling for something to complain about.
And when someone walks, he can hit the door.
What's the difference?
Great news has been sealed.
Even though we've been watching smart phone applications like Fitbit, we haven't got a reason to do nothing like this.
The new will pass, and my use will be cut short.
However, Pokémon's success will result in many games that will help him become more active, shape and health-friendly, for the sake of the success of him.

Simone Billes, a woman who received a gold medal in her scientific general appreciation
You forgot the press.
You forgot your breath.
Simone Billes is sorry for all this.
The name is dynamic.
Shut the fuck up.
It's a surprise with the earth.
It's perfect down there.
And now she's an Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American scientist, who first completed his general assessment on Friday, made a clear distinction between himself and the rest of the world.
The total of 62,198 pounds, the gold medals and the "Son Five" team friends Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medals were on the top of Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Billes of the United States of America, on Persebbe day, in Brazil, 2016, performed performance at the end of the artistic yynastic general evaluation of women at Rio de Janeiro Yaz Olympics.
Billes became the fourth and fifth American woman who received the general appreciation of her back and probably heard the name of her own generation and perhaps the best of all times.
When the last crowd was released, they fell in their eyes, and this mother's long journey to reach it ended.
This success led to the same level as Michael Helps at every stage of the race that brought the track to new levels:
Billes spent the last three years as a 15-year-old champion of the 15th World Championship, and the 1984 Olympic Championship Mary Lou Retton was one of the most successful careers in the race that has ever been known as "the best dynamist I've ever seen."
A final test in Brazil was waiting for him; it was much more of a struggle between himself and the other people who fought with Billes and the high expectations that were created.
Texas was supposed to be a disappointment to return to the family in Spring with a gold mine less than a gold mine.
Simone Billes, left, and Aly Raisman, founded in Brazil, the United States, 2016 Rio de Janeiro Write Olympics, followed by the general recognition of artistic dynamistic women and the silver medals, Persembe, the Lord.
Billes, who was the first member of the Millennium Team coordinator, won the Sunday for Martha Karolyi and his party as a symbol of honor.
Even though it's not exactly right when you don't see them in this long run, it's not exactly right.
The part of the movement of the earth is also made up of Latin music that will be fully suited to the design outside Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl discovered by Boorman's mother was on a trip to a gym where Aimee Boorman was born when he was a younger child by his mother and father.
Since 2013, this hasn't lost any of the general estimates; it's a series of possibilities that Bills has to continue as long as he wants.
It's been a while, even though Mustafin was leading on two rotations.
Billes has not yet been made up of the world's air-conditioning tools and the lack of space.
It went forward at 15,433 points in the ocean machine, and it dropped at 15,933 points on the ground floor.
Raisman's eyes were lighter to him when he was waiting for the last minute, and when he saw Billes' vision, which he once wrote, was true, the red, white, and blue eyes were spread around the sky.
Raisman's performance was like his first four years of performance that lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, a 22-year-old U.S. team captain named "nine."
In time, he sent a kiss to the crowd after his departure from the place where he appeared to be suspicious of a return.
And for 19-year-old Billes, it can be said that a very divided tweet at the beginning of this week has now made a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims were shot at in a serial killer, listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl in Phoenix's first serial killer's ten years were shot in the car, according to police reports published on Friday, and listening to music.
The authorities, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter said they were shot in a car parked on a garage road on the 12th of Haziran.
The report says that the gunman was standing on the side of the car and that he was shooting eight hands with a gun and running away with another vehicle.
The police say these three murders don't seem to be worth a lot of money because they didn't get the adult victims' bags or $2,900 money.
The Phoenix police spokesman, Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Howard, indicated that the investigators of the armed attack had been moved to investigate whether this was related to the previous four attacks.
In a four - month period, seven people were killed in nine attacks in nine concentration camps in the areas where the Spanish people lived, and two were injured.
Howard, at the beginning of this month, told KPHO about CBS, "This happened in the area of my apartment in front of a house."
In the late 1990s, it is thought that Nissan, who is a true coffee model, used several tools that include black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln at the end of 1990.
The researchers refused to explain the evidence that the attacks were related to the same killer and that the results were achieved by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital for his injuries and then lost his life.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maliah lost her life in the event.
A man who witnessed there told the police they were sitting on a parking lot, saying that the music was not an unusual situation.
At the same time, the authorities published a police report on fire aimed at an empty truck in three and a half hours ago.
Researchers have found pellets, extracts a pellets from a pellets, and detects pelvic particles in the engine division.
The mother of a 6-year-old microseficiary patient: "Takes a better thing."
Like a six-year-old boy, Edmund Piccito sings, plays, and of course he loves his mother.
But there's a micro-fealing disorder in Edmund, which is a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was not aware of during her pregnancy.
When I first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't want that.
That's not true, of course you want it."
He and his wife told Vincent that Edmund could never know them and that he could not even live.
Some doctors went on until they offered me a place to stay.
Piccito said, "I'm the first person to say that people don't think I'm doing this anymore."
Edmund can walk with a driver's help.
Edmund didn't sit tight until he was three years old, and he didn't wake up and he doesn't talk yet.
But he's slowing down to some turning points.
He can walk and get on the bike with his help.
He also likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented for "sing me to sing."
Piccito, CBS News, said, "We teach him sign language."
But it's not a sign language, as we know, but it says that Edmund has followed his own signs.
Microseficiary may develop into a number of different conditions; there may be a genetic condition such as Edmund and may be caused by infections caused by viruses such as Zika during pregnancy.
The signs and symptoms of the disease can be very different.
It's too early to tell how the lives of people with diabetes will be affected by this situation.
Piccito remembers the emotional burden of the uncertainty of the future.
I was wondering what would happen immediately.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know that.
Actually, I haven't asked a question about the vision of the disease for a long time since I didn't expect anyone to tell me the truth.
However, Piccito, the mother of children who have lost their birth due to Zika, will be in a position to call for reliable advice.
He's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Louisiana has been running the rescue teams of water and water pressure in Mississippi.
In Louisiana, the water pressure and the public water pressure led to an unexpected change in Friday's election by waiting for more water to come on Saturday.
The U.S. Air Force Services, in the north of Louisiana, and in the south of Mississippi, reported that there was a flood in a number of waters, and that this caused the public water pressure after the heavy rains.
Louisiana Valisi John Bel Edwards said that government officials were always in contact with local authorities and that they were on the way to support areas that affected the situation.
Mike Steele, a member of the Office for Internal Security and Rapid Status, said he was in demand for high water tools, boats and superpowers.
Steele just said he was asked for superpowers for the Tangapahoa Hall.
Most of Louisiana's water pressure will be applied until Saturday.
He said the air condition services could drop to 3 and 5 inches of water on a single surface.
In South Alabama, there was a water pressure on Friday, since the rain continued in the area of Mobile.
Both of them are expected to reach record levels in the Amit Nehri and Denham Springs, near Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Dr. Alek Krautmann said he could leave many houses under water in the bathrooms near Baton Rouge.
He also indicated that the water pressure in the Ascension Hall created a threat to the air from the slow flow of full water to the Maurepas Valley.
Liverpool, in Louisiana, was already at the highest level at the highest level measured at 9 a.m.
The rescue teams continue to rescue people from the waterprints of Amit and Wilkinson, which are located in the vicinity of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and widow son, was among those who were saved by Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) usually said the water coming from Beaver Dersi, 400 feet away from the house rose rapidly during the night.
And another of the companions of the thicket, who was sitting nearby, said that his son had warned him.
Hansford said, "We woke up and kept coming."
He was coming up to me.
Her wife told Hansford that it was the highest love she's seen in the area for 48 years.
Hansford said that he and his family were pregnant and that he was the only one who could make it.
Hansford said three of the emergency workers were rescued by a large, military truck in a way that saved them on Friday at Gloster's office.
Krautmann said that as the rains continued, the water press "slowly spread" and the authorities thought they'd ordered the release.
Krautmann said a visitor near Livingston announced that there was a rains of 13.75 in the morning from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said this country has been in a high-level state since Wednesday.
The authorities said that there was a need for the rescue of the residents of the Tangapahoa Palace, and the removal of schools in five school districts.
A woman in Tangapahoa, WWL in CBS's office, reported that her mechanical member said she was under 200 houses of water.
The peacekeepers were taken to the two churches that were to be studied, but they are under the water right now.
Mahalle Soromulus Robby Miller said 72 people who were trapped by the high waters and seven domestic animals were saved.
In the city of Amite and in Hammond, there were cases of people who had been investigated.
He said, “When you are returned to your homes, you will be permitted to return.”
In the port of Hammond in Tangapahoa Mahalesin, the high waters were closed almost twice, and there were restrictions on the purchase by the residents who tried to keep water away from their homes and businesses.
The city director, Lacy Landrum, said, "The biggest water pressure we've ever had was in March."
It's going to be like this.
In Mississippi, Harrison's case was said to continue in a manner consistent with the water in the Rupert Lacy Kröfez River.
On Tuesday, he said that you were informed that you had some water pressure in the house but that there was no information in this way until Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods at the Amiti, lives in this area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water in places I've never seen before," and he added, "and there's still rain."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown saved his life from the Philadelphia assault.
The police explained that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time a 6-year-old boy was shot in town this week.
CBS Philadelphia identified Mahaj Brown's grandfather and grandfather.
His grandfather and his grandfather said that in Brown's body, he was in his knowledge of more than once in the areas in which he had been shot by a fire.
His grandmother Delores Melegez, at the station, said, "It's too painful, it's a little bit crazy with dogs."
I can't believe this.
He was listed among those who protected his child in the hospital and passed some operations.
The family told the station that she was waiting to get better.
I was going to start my first high school.
Brown was between four men shot in the Germantown area.
Two, 29, one, two men, 32 years old, were shot.
CBS Philadelphia, a 29-year-old man, said that the situation was critical, while the other two victims were stable.
The station said that one of the 29 - year - old men, who was critical of the situation, had been shot in front of a car.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are checking whether one of the wounded was attacked.
Detectives said the CBS Philadelphia could have fired more than one gun attack.
The scene was full of bullets in the form of weapons of various assaults.
Looks like it's definitely a long-term encounter.
There were obstacles on both sides of the chain and the removal.
This shows that more than one gun attack has been found and both of them are active," Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
He lost more than one house and vehicle in the region.
No arrests were made, and the police's security cameras were informed.
A 6-year-old girl was shot by a gun in her arm while she was playing in the West Oak Hall on Tuesday.
He's still looking for a suspect during his recovery.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This year, I gave this name to the Hymnostic Women's Olympic Team, and there's more than one reason for it.
First of all, since 1984, I have been involved in all the Scripture Olympics, and the United States has never been so printed before.
The second is: This team has three Gymnastics that inspire many girls with different ethnic roots: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie".
The creation of this team brought together by the Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian makes everyone proud.
The team doesn't finally have a look like America.
At the same time, it strengthens the presence of women in the Middle East and Latin America at the top levels of this sport.
In the past four years, the first woman has always been an African American, a geneticist.
The past year, Simone and Gabby didn't have one and two.
It's a powerful thing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a wonderful Olympic champion, and he supported America.
Now, we're not expecting Simone Billes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are the world's three World Championships, but can testify to the amazing performances of the scientific routines he's currently performing.
On Friday, Simone became the fourth American to the back of a gold medal won in her general appreciation of women.
And his team friend Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
We know this sport for the best time, but it doesn't look like it's in the country's genetic courses.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison in the Olympics.
The reason they're "son Five" is that there will be only four Gyms in the next Olympics team, and this will be the last year of Marta Caroly's terror.
But indeed, a highly mediocre sports and Gymnastics are working in private schools that are primarily funded by the education, travel, form, competition, hotel resources (for trainers, gymnasians and families) and supported by many more.
Most of these pharmaceutical clubs can support these operations, they're located in the wealthy state of the state.
These clubs, the only place that Gymnastics can learn, and the families of the Gymnastics need a long-term legacy.
Simone Billes' coach, Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's driver, Maggie Haney, have been training these athletes since they started high school.
We don't give a lot of young girls from Simone, Gabby and Laurie to the more expensive and accessible medical education.
I spent my own time in medicine 20 years ago.
In my studies, we conducted free and low-level, national and national seminars on 15000 young people (formerly North and Hispanic) in Harlem.
In the month of the year, we will extend to Detroit (the country where I grew up) to teach this wonderful Olympic sport and to give young people the opportunity to take advantage of it.
He develops the strength, gender and coordination of the body, and provides frequent work, discipline and decision-making characteristics.
This combination, health, school, and success, provides long-term advantages.
Thousands of young girls will be the inspiration of this team, and this is a great thing.
I'm involved in sports activities, especially for girls.
We're really going through exciting times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison are grateful that they brought the gold medals to the Olympic team to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison and that they have clearly shown "The Power of Girls" and have many young girls who have different background plans to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, the assistant doctors decided to continue the strike.
The audience hoped that the agreement with the United Kingdom officials would end with the agreement that had been developed with the United Kingdom officials, but only 58 percent of the assistants involved in the play had refused to play.
In December, Mr. Hunt, NHS, explained the plans for the implementation of the "no one's property" and the "no one's property" that would harm the patient personally and in the long run.
The first assistant doctor group was held to discuss new changes during the night and at the end of the week in order to improve care beyond normal hours.
BMA's assistant doctoral committee president Dr. Ellen McCourt said yesterday: "Asian doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, and in particular they think that this will trigger the current labour crisis and not make a sound noise to all doctors."
The first doctor should only make progress in this period of eight weeks, and time should be filled.
The efforts made by BMA to resolve the disagreement have been met by the government's lack of interest in the establishment of interaction and, in some cases, by the silence of the government.
This is a development despite Jeremy Hunt's promise that it will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must immediately move, remove my work, and listen to the concerns of the assistant doctors."
Asian doctors point out, without doing this, they're just saying that they're ready to step up the process of slowing down.
At the end of Nisan, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 meetings were held, the nurses and speakers had to look at the doctor's place in the emergency.
The speakers hoped that the agreement would end after the agreement had been concluded with the United Kingdom officials.
BMA wants to improve the weekend for the 54,000 assistant doctors on the subject of the contract.
NHS Executive Director Daniel Mortimer called on the assistant doctors not to apply any graffiti.
Mr. Mortimer said to them, "Grev will not solve anything, but why worry, despair, and anxiety for the sick, the caregivers and their families, and for those who are in need."
For the past two months, we have continued to meet with the Asian Doctors Committee, and we have approached the Health Department and other experts in a timely manner with regard to their concerns about the Observance of the Ministry and the Ministry of the Interior.
Workers, important issues - division, educational integrity, careers, educational heritage, anti-fraud model, educational licenses and gender-related issues - were hoping that they would not be subjected to a positive relationship with BMA in March, Saturday and May, and that they would not be able to act in accordance with the agreements with BMA, England's School of Education and Health.
A drug that can reduce the risk of heart disease by 2 £ per day
Thousands of heart disease will benefit from 2 billion mellitus a day after suggesting that more people have been given over a longer period of time.
In order to reduce the risk of a crisis for people with heart failure, ticagrelors who prevent it is the cause of the conflict.
It took 12 months to receive the heart crisis and to reduce the risk of seizure or another crisis.
NHS monitor, NICE, suggested that it be given to people over four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS monitor, NICE, suggested that it be given people over four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year around 120,000 people in England face a crisis of heart and one in four of these is going to run another crisis or strike.
The cause of heart crises and conflicts is the formation of layers of rain matter in one another's walls.
If the lung is split, this may be the cause of the blood clot and the heart rate of the blood that goes into the heart, and it may be the heart crisis.
And if he gets out of bed, he'll be in charge of stopping his brain blood.
There's a higher risk of someone who's been hit by a crisis before.
This risk is reduced by Ticagrelor, created by the United Kingdom firm AstraZeneca, which was created by Brilique trade name.
Today, the NICE scale suggests that 90 mg of ticagrelor should be given for 12 months and that 60 mg should be administered in combination with aspirin twice daily for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the existence of two-thirds of global prevention, four times the heart rate of those in crisis is another heart crisis or failure, and generally the results are devastating."
The fear of rebirth is that we can create an effect on the quality of our life.
The arguments are to show that the use of tagagrelor in combination with the aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of heart attack and guilt in people who have had a heart attack before.
We are happy that the Ticagrel has not been suggested as late as it is, for thousands of people expected to benefit from it.
Since Ticagrelo's information on the effectiveness and safety of the three years is limited to the risk of cancer in the first place, it is not possible to find a cure after this time.
The PC culture has increased its playlessness in Muslim areas
Mr. Lutfur Rahman, President of the former Tower of Hamlets, was arrested for misconduct following the government's report last year
Just as today's corrupt government report shows, the political culture of truth has led to an increase in the widespread playing field in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Officer Sir Eric Pickles, the "extremely speciality of ethnic origin and religion" has been designated by police, electoral observers and prosecutors, as the reason for the extension of the electoral evidence.
The former secretary of the community and the anti-road crime of our day said that it was a bad situation for the electorate to be sent with religious necessity so that the police would have to be allowed to play outside the gates to protect the fearful electors.
It was suggested that the voters should be present at their side in order to prove their identity during the vote.
In the present case, it is sufficient to specify the name of the selection and the address.
The report suggests that people should be dressed twice during the voting process to prevent them from playing twice.
Sir Eric said that those in the audience should be better protected.
He was called upon to make better access to the Press in the case of decisions of the Committees of the Constitution and the Committees of the Non-Discrimination Groups or the Working Groups.
"It's not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from the corrupt and materialistic culture."
The report was prepared with the address of Downing Street after the game scandal in Northern London.
In the past year, a special election court has decided to proceed with the appointment of the President of the House of Lord Lutfur.
The Court found that the Lord of Mercy had "restrainted the hearts of the Muslims," and that those who did wrong themselves and prevented them from committing crimes of Islam.
The Lord's campaign was declared to be "a religious duty on the part of believers to laugh at one another."
The game was suspicious to 300, or it was the end of my false identity, that is, the other way.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud in the country's generality.
He warned himself, especially about the abuses he was using in the mail, where he was accused of being pressured by the elderly authorities of the Muslim community to play on the island.
Sir Eric found some suggestions to set up the gambling system to identify who the people are, including who they are.
The report included the following comments: "Several ethnic minority groups were given evidence of their respect for women and young people's rights, particularly in the indigenous communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh, by the use of the press in the way that the elderly are treated according to the wishes of the elderly.
"There were concerns about this kind of behaviour, based on ethnic origin and religious prejudice."
Sir Eric found 50 recommendations to prevent political activists from operating with the aim of "yyy assembly" by e-mail and to set up a system.
Theresa May's report also calls for the speeding up of record controls to prevent the use of the electoral library for the purpose of moving and social assistance.
Whether the selection should be prompted for confirmation before acting.
It's the constant use of someone's fingers to prevent a person from playing twice.
Whether systematic controls are carried out on the basis of a person's compliance with the consent of the person to be designated as fit to pay a vote.
The three-year limit for requests made for automatic mail use.
Political campaign officials and activists are being advised to take action on the charges of e-mailed games and e-mailed games.
Police, if you don't mind, you're not allowed to throw a spell around you.
In 1983 the Law of the People's Republic was amended to make it easier for people to be afraid of crime.
It's not fair to take photos of them.
The only requirement for speaking English is that they do not vote.
Whether the personal choice is strengthened by the law that governs the entry into the head of the election.
Sir Eric, in the Tower of Hamlets, said that no crime was committed without torture by the police.
"The Court of Election has decided that there is no place to be guilty of misconduct and illegal acts committed for the sake of the Lord and the representative of Lutfur."
He found himself guilty of some of his own suspicions, according to the nature of his ignorance.
At the same time, he also acted on non-active "smoker marking checks" in the electoral register departments.
Sir Eric said, "Did Tower Hamlet's annual court decision give a warning?
Our son, although he has the pride of creating the mother of parliaments, may be concerned about the spread of secret elections and the rejection of some rules.
Be crazy about Kate's bicycle and other famous games of Rio Olympics
This week, Rio 2016, a French biker, who proved to be more effective than the Olympics, turned to the crazy for Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, a French bicycle that proved to be like Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic sports player is not the only sport that pays attention to the praisers when they fight for gold medals; at least he thinks that's the social media.
That's why, in respect of all the famous subjects we've seen in Rio Games and our screens, the F.C.D., has prepared a list of Olympic sports that look like they're in front of the Olympics.
Audrey and Kurt: A.D. Boys' School Team member, Brady Ellison (left), compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's bike knife, many people in the transformation environment have shown that a child could be equal to Leonardo DiCaprio as much as two.
The U.S. Human Rights Committee member, Brady Ellison, took photos that reflected the similarity between the year of the Arbitration film.
And the kid acknowledged that he's been saying he's been like Leo since he was a kid.
Brady, Huffington Post said, "I don't think it's a big deal, except hair and hair."
'That's why I think it's a relief.'
London has one of the most popular comparisons of 2012 and is certainly more likely to be concerned about it: the incredible similarity between the English long-term athlete Greg Rutherford's popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian mathematician Alicia Mustafina has been described as one of Cuba's major, significant, meaningful American designer Gloria Estefan.
And in the sea, South African giant Cameron van der Burgh, it's been like Glee's annual Matthew Morrison for years.
Changes: This user means Nathan's first film year is an atomic version
Tennis' year-old Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have been compared to one another for a long time.
The Russian team's gold medalist, actress Annalynne McCord, has the same bronze source and red hair as the actress Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, says that "Joseph Gordon Levitt" has been able to understand the athletic version of Nathan Adrian from the United States team.
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter's star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have hundreds of glasses and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user, and the other people were so happy to see this similarity.
A theory that remains in the air: This user thinks that this couple might be behind the look
One Twitter user said that he was happy that the Internet was "to think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter would be double."
In fact, it has a football star in the U.S. and an actress playing in Dexter.
Among other popular comparisons, Kerri Walsh-Jennings is also taking place with the actress Laura Linney, who has almost the same smile as another gold-denominist, Gabby Douglas, who is a young atheist who has the same smile as Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic mirror apologized for the fact that China's face was dead as a cloud.
Byron MacDonald's 14-year-old analysis of the 4x200 m radius of Ai Yanhan's 14-year-old freedom was very encouraging to CBC's live Olympics.
The Canadian media organization CBC forced one 14-year-old spy to apologize for the fact that China's face had gone "like a small cloud" and the war's death as a cloud.
Spiker Byron MacDonald, women thought that the microphone was closed when they started explaining their ideas at the 4x200 m free race final.
CBC's spy team was told that MacDonald, who was involved in breaking up 'enk', was saying, 'The 14-year-old little Chinese was seriously injured, my baby'.
He was so excited, he walked away like a bad dream and died like a snake.
Thank you for that.
China's Superintendent Ai Yanhan (14) ended the second stage of the battle at 1:57.79, during which the Canadian Taylor Rack left the gap between the Canadians and China in the fall of 1.61 seconds.
Canadian monitors move quickly after they're surprised by the tone and language reason used
Emmett Macfarlane said that the CBC spy said that his 14-year-old face had died like a dog.
He wasn't aware you're still in public.'
China Ai Yanhan, 4 x 200 m in the Freebest War, is known as 'the 14-year-old little Chinese was heavy, baby.'
Byron MacDonald published comments on Twitter very hard and fast, and most of them were self-evident.
Twitter users didn't arrest themselves when they heard how innocent Byron Macdonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Vay #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you're making us all look like a hunter.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who published the CBC, apologized for MacDonald's behavior, saying, "We're sorry for the situation that has been published about the dispute."
They did not say a word of falsehood, and you are sorry for what happened.’
CBC has been able to apologize at least 90 times for the people who tweeted in the process.
Another spy, Scott Russell, had to apologize for MacDonald's name.
CBC later copied and arrested the Twitter user over 90 of his complaints about MacDonald's circumstances.
The network has issued a statement asking for forgiveness immediately.
We want to express our regret about the fact that these statements are found and published.
Last night, we apologized to our observers, to our social media, and to our followers.
We want to explain that Byron's circumstances were not the personality of the performer, but the performance.
In addition, they could be very inappropriate and unreasonable, and byron would be very sad at the end of what they said.
On Friday, after lunch, he apologized in MacDonald's release and said he didn't want to be in a personal investigation.
He said, "I'd like to apologize for a situation I'm doing after the night's party."
"I wasn't in the personality of his face, but in his performance."
"I don't need a word too much, I didn't want to be rude, and I'm so sorry."
The Primark client's face to the woman who tried to smoke in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know what to do when a woman took off her clothes to try to hunt in the middle of Primark.
Worse yet, the woman looked at how she looked at it, took it out, and retraced it.
He continued to look and then tried to have four drinks at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Volkestone.
It was the Primark store in Bouverie Place, a shopping center in Volkestone, where the woman was trying to make a move before she was rehabilitated.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children at the store at the time, said after trying to get her in the dark, she said she was wearing herself and leaving the store without getting anything.
He said, “The people did not believe in him.”
He stopped in the middle of the store and took a drink from the wine, dressed his wand and his pants.
"She didn't try to find a special place to do this, she was running out of respect."
"Everyone looked at him when he got out of the boat and realized that he didn't like the trip because he had to take it back."
He tried three more kisses until he decided he didn't like anything, and then he got out of the store again.
"He didn't seem to care about those who were watching him, and he didn't think he'd buy any more of the shoes he was trying to buy."
Ms. Davidson (33) in Kent said, "It's a shame to think that someone else's wearing a clean, unsanitary guest will go home."
This thing happened after Saturday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "I think that the person who bought his clothes after that came out and bought it for sale, that's a good thing."
'When I took a new trip home, it would be really bad to think that the other trip was getting out and that the other one was coming to me before I broke up.'
A Primark speaker said, "Primark, 9 August, is aware of what happened in our store in Volkestone."
The fresh fruit is removed from the market.
How can you protect yourself from the attacks of Krav Maga?
The outside world is very dangerous, but this video claimed by Dailymail.com can help you be more secure.
We met with Rhon Mizrachi, head of the New York Central Krav Maga Federation to learn how to deal with the nearby armed giants.
Before he wants you, he's coming up from behind, this video will show you how you can turn your back on the trigger.
Mizarachi says when you're nearing the back, you'll see what you have to do first and you'll get your face back and say, "Let go of the gun."
Then you'll shoot your gun with your arm in front of your shoulder, and then you'll shoot your face with your left arm.
Then, when you press your bows, the pain of the attacker will go out to two sides, and this evening you will take the weapon by hand, and the weapon will be returned to him, and you will strike his face with the edge of his sword, so that he will stand up.
When the gunman approaches, he's using a similar technique. You turn your body from the edge of a fire and you can't fire the gun.
At the same time, He will take away from the sky your weight, and bring you back from the sky, to fight you, and then you will be returned to it, and you will be guided.
Does he come to listen?
Look at the video to see how Mirrachi did it.
But do not forget, if you are not a master of the Qur'an, you will have to give up your money in order to avoid any loss.
Travelling Ian Wright translated the language into European's worst places for travel
The English tour carried out a serious test of compassion and learning by accusing some of Europe's worst and worst places.
The server and travel writer, Suffolkllo Ian Wright (51), used a Euro banknote to prove the power of the charity system, a Piccadily Circuit floor, a telephone button of a train tunnel, and a detailed telephone in Russia.
He used a lymometer to show himself and us what kind of work he had to do before he lied to each other.
But the attempt to become a movie called The Lickhaker's Guide to Inner Strong gave some surprising results.
Although the idea of lying in a trick used by thousands of people is very distasteful, there is actually much more evil bacteria in the mutfox lab.
Mr. Wright has met doctors and nurses about the growth and health of mede bacteria throughout the journey in Europe.
And he did not create an effect except with the evil of his own mouth.
Mr. Wright, he recognized the world to test the stability of his mind by eating strange and strange things.
This task in a wide range of general steps at train stations tested the system of tolerance
In the film about this, he said, "I haven't been very careful since I was a child, and I've had so many things to drink from, from the soil, the left and the right water."
After the film, she was able to prove the cause of this idea in a certain way.
The only thing he refused was a bad general in Russia.
The version sample showed the number of luminometers on 4,000 degrees.
If it has to be compared, it has to be less than 60 if it's new or broken.
But it was a Russian public toilet that refused to lie when the number of luminometers was less than 60 or less than 4,000.
Mr. Wright and Fin winter fruits manufacturer Valio, showed the number of bacteria in different places like bananas, and the manufacturer of The Lickhaker's Guide to Inner Strong
He said in his own movie, "Come here and be one of the worst things I've ever done in this tunnel."
There's nothing worse than this!
I'm not going to lie to anything because it's so dark inside.
The Lickhaker's Guide to Inner Strength, Fin is produced along with Valio, the manufacturer of milk products.
The company has provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gephilus, which contains vitamins C and D that help strengthen bacteria and the immune system.
Valio's Exhibits, Fruit Waters and New Categories Division, Deputy Director-General Niko Vuorenma said, "We really wanted to give the producers something new.
It's something that's interesting and it's going to explain the benefits of probiotics at the same time.
Finally, we've done a lot of crazy brainstorms in the middle of the idea, "Let's call Ian."
They're suggesting that concerns about the health of Mide have become a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking about products, we just wanted to put the products in a much larger bond, and every day the good and bad bacteria around us, the importance of health, and the system of forgiveness.
A global health concern is coming up, and we'd be able to give more information about this situation in a more appealing way.
At the same time, I think that the film shows that we have a wonderful picture!
Tom Hakala, director of the film, added: "I say so; Ian, if I lied about some of the things I wanted to lie about in the movie, Ian would lose my respect for him."
Of course, it was easy for Ian to lie, but some were very difficult.
I'm glad we saved some of this bad lie.'
In 2015, a survey conducted by Valio linked 84 percent of the participants to mild acid bacteria and 58 percent indicated that Lactic acid bacteria were used in at least one way.
The Maganda family, before the graduation of Saltash, adopted Cornwall's social council
One Hungarian family lost $50,000 on social issues that they were diagnosed with because of fear of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and his wife, Shawn Trebilcock, were fired from the story in Saltash, Cornwall.
When they were forced to leave the country, he was surprised to see that the matter was not resolved by the authorities.
In the walls there were huge gaps, broken roofs, trashed up on the ground, and written on the walls.
Family is now distanced from the county and is considered to be benefiting from special care options
Cornwall Houssing, director of the Cornwall Housing Consulate, said Donna McEvoy was afraid that the situation would not be saved.
He said to himself, "This is what I think is really a boss for the people here and people don't have to live this way.
There's a lot to do because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their names have a bad one.
The family had three sons, and according to the police, the family had many scary behaviors that involved drug use, drug trafficking, drug trafficking, quarreling, and disbelief.
In June, a decision was made for Skeldon (47) who was called upon in the Kira agreement.
He found old trash in many rooms where he thought he was going to fall
In the past, drug dealers have been removed from the scene of government bombings.
The neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and the police were busy.
Cornwall Houssing, after he had been known for 11 weeks as an extension of his freedom of movement, was forced to leave the country this week.
The study was welcomed by the comfortable neighbors who told them that their lives had turned out to be a waste of time.
One said, "No one was in his age."
We've been living with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
If we say how many times we see cops here, you can't believe it.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because there was a lot of noise in the middle, and we're not used to it!
They're gone. Everything's going to be great.
Cornwall Houssing's community mission, Adam Fitzpatrick, said his family didn't cooperate with the local authorities.
The family had been living in this house for 20 years, and the police had been calling the police with a lot of money.
The social context has been broken down and the old games have been thrown into pieces.
He added: "It is a shame that the reader and his family are not responsible for any problem; it has always been a choice that Cornwall Houssing has made.
This was a very difficult task because the conduct was too strict and the actions of neighbors were too scary to witness.
I am very grateful for the efforts of my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and the members of the community who are taking the lead in informing us.
I hope that this development will be understood as a message of comfort to neighbors and that it will not show favor to antisocial behavior.

A low-flight military aircraft crashing across the valley in Portétiz
Portuguese tourists in Aveiro have lived their lives in shock
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flights from low to low
Air forces said it was a flight of education, but security was too risky.
That's when tourists start to panic as they pass through the sky full of ice.
In dramatic sights, the army near the contact level of those on the south side of Aveiro in the north of Porteciz.
The speakers came to their feet as they were concerned about the noise of the jet engines that they had created before they could see what was coming to them from the clouds.
The case came to the farm near Aveiro after midnight in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few dancers who participated in a social media video of the dramatic near flight, said, "Two times he really went out of nowhere and looked like he was hit at a point."
Nuno Arroja added, "I'm sorry, and I swear I'm gonna feel like I'm going to fall on the plane."
The tourists at Aveiro's school were shocked when the flight from the darkness began to begin flying in the middle of the night.
The Portuguese Air Force explained that the P-3C Orion aircraft today is in a position to learn about the pilot's fishing boats and to control them so slowly that it is the only way to control them.
He said that the recent closure of the nuclear power plant was more than normal because of the apparent weakness of the health, but the air forces were alarmed that no one was at risk of safety.
This letter, the burning power of Portuguese fires greatly affected certain parts of the mother's cancer and caused the death of four people in Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces said that they should fly off the ground for reasons that would make it difficult for the pilot to see today (representation of power from powerful fires)
He was in flight training and wanted to identify fishing boats from the pilot as part of his flight
The London girl student who was involved in the ISIS was killed in Syria.
The last year, we were told that Kadiza Sultana, one of three English students who left London, died in Syria.
The lawyer, Akunjee, said his family had received information about the death of Rakka in Syria a few weeks ago.
According to the ITV News on Friday, he is thought to be killed in a Russian air attack on the Rakka region that he was a strong group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and her family said she was planning to flee from the country where she had suffered from the war and return to Britain.
Akunjee, "We hope that this situation will lead to a grave situation for others and, as a matter of fact, reduce the risk of going to war areas and break people's views on this election."
In February 2015, two students from Sultana and northern London headed for Turkey and then to the border with Syria.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS soldier in Syria and was missing in months.
Reid indicated that Clinton would not leave Garland as a High Court island when he was elected
In the Senate, the Democratic Leader Harry Reid said that he believed that Judge Merrick Garland would be elected President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by Hilry Clinton.
The Conciliators at the Senate, the President Barack Obama, had refused to accept Garland in March.
Senator Mitch McConnell, President of the General Assembly, said that someone who will take the place of former High Court Judge Antonin Scalia will choose a new one.
Reid, in a visual conversation on Friday, said that Clinton believed that he would choose Garland and "why you're doing this."
Later, a speaker named Reid said he didn't speak directly to Clinton and he was in the exhibition about not showing Garland himself.
He took Garland and said that Clinton's team didn't want to "break up the situation" by making a new choice.
Garland, head of the U.S. Court of Appeal, Columbia.
Reid said that the communityists who prevented Garland from showing up said that Donald Trump was "suppliers" and "news".
He said it wasn't suitable for Trump's job.
Treats indicated that 'for women as long as it is for widows'
The Treats report is working with photographer David Bellemera, who is working on the production of a film prepared by the 1970s by Pirelli for 2017.
But instead of famous and famous people, the 2017 NU Elham Perilers are working to find new generation-based top models.
Treat's president, Steve Shaw, was different from the old Playboys, which was high at the beginning of this year, because he said "playboy's for men."
I'm doing this for women.
Well, I guess my schedule believes that's what it is.
Shaw, in the section on Sunday, said, "We need to return to the process of changing the way women look in order to be able to look at these images peacefully as a source of inspiration."
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a good job.
Models can be sent as a translator, or they can be included in open meetings in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinil target: Who really are the fields that sold the plate?
The middle-aged, only men love wine.
Allow us to tell you that this brain stops giving true data before it can be found in the amazing design of the universe.
According to YouGov, the return of the plates, which are very much of a matter, is not the Y angle behind the newness of a physical object, but the end of the middle age nostalgia.
In the near future, there's a lot of wine album fields selling between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, it's the lowest of 18-24-year-olds.
At the same time, it is not only the integration of interested people; it has a emotional advantage; older vinyl recipients generally love to hide their feelings (%56 and 53) and people who are ashamed of being alone (%69 and %66).
And what about the consequences of YouGov?
If this blog was a news story published on TV, the camera Soho's majority of people were watching, walking with a huge gray suit before he stopped, and then he opened his hand and said, "Let's have a look."
Then let's take a look.
Soho's centre is still in a number of scientific discs stores, while losing its slow and uneven atmosphere (some of the buildings that are now owned by independent sellers) still exist.
I probably wanted to stop the camera for the next part, and I was trying to keep some of these different men close to some of these stores and to keep them alive and aware of their emotional circumstances.
From Sister Ray (two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless Records (two: eight middle-aged men, probably a 20-year-old woman) I've been following in the backyard of a meeting and looking at the store for a few hours.
I'm asking you if you're a collector.
He says, "I guess I will."
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 pounds.
These plates, which are placed above them, are washed up by the walls of the sitting room.
The reason for the collection of albums and singles in so many numbers is a result of a partial cost-effective approach; now he can get the plates that he didn't get when he left first, and he can buy back what he sold in his youth and in his absence of metal.
He says, "Most of what I've got in the 60s is the end of the 70s, I'm 11 or 12 years old, and I'm too young to get."
And he says, "I don't drink cigarettes, I don't drink too much alcohol.
That's my bad dream.
And Wez (25) who works at Sister Ray thinks most of the clients he meets are according to yourGov profile.
But he also realized that he had created a new wave of advertising in the media, and that people who heard that the fashion was coming back also felt the need to buy back old plates.
At the meetings I did, I usually realized that in 1998 or 1999, people took their collections.
The customers are now selling their vinyls to buy them first."
This can explain the increase of a certain ageing person who has resuscitated the vinyl.
And what about the emotional significance of the plates?
It takes a few seconds to find out that there's a group of people in a store like Pontiica.
According to Wez, some grown-up customers, especially non-disputed payment systems, have been able to do so.
Some of those who hold vinyls may want to escape from the digital world and remember their peaceful youth memories.
Wez says, "Sometimes it's possible to fill a void or see material objects as a form of confort."
Since I am a collector myself, I have this and I think that most people are.
It's an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like social services."
A report made in Nisan revealed that 50 percent of the vinyl album fields we've been working on last month have not yet heard of.
At the same time, the survey concluded that there was a gap that was never used by% and that 7 percent had no plates.
At this stage of the news, I've probably been the last time I've noticed a series of bossa innovations.
It's an element distinguished by Johnny (42) who worked in the Sounds of Universe.
"One came to me in the evening, and said, "I don't have any money, but I want to get a radiohead plate to put it in our pocket."
It certainly does not represent this large percentage, but it certainly does.
Get more, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't have any paychecks."
They're not older, but young people, at the end of their ten-year-olds, are making new contributions to this.
Now, I see that when I get to Fopp, almost all the time for the vinyl, it's getting really different.
In the '70s, there's guys, tourists, young boys, and middle-aged women.
Although sex-intensive pops are more abundant than the last part of the stores in the atmosphere (the end of Wild Beast) that have gone up there, it is good to see the difference between customers.
No one's looking in particular, but it's hard to solve the psychological traumas that upset them for over 30 seconds.
Elanora (27), she's been traveling to Fopp and looking at my desk.
He just went out to look at the vives instead of fighting.
He says he didn't make much of it. He says he didn't have a choice to make his collection.
It's very complicated.
It's easier to listen to music than to computers or other images but the beauty of wine..."
I don't know how to explain it, it's really not like that.
The last time I was here, a store that inspired the new generation of vinyls: Urban Outfitters.
I've been looking for a group of young girls around the Polaroid cameras for a while in front of a discussion about a cross-platform sale.
Solda Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's plates have a full string space; no plates for a central collection; a modern and class match.
No one cares; maybe it's just because it's a decoration goal, and it's so high that it won't touch some.
It's totally "a moral vinyl."
But the worry about these things, the more money the sector earns, the less a client sends to Soho's heart; there's no more thing to complain about.
It's not surprising that more money and more time is spent on things like a demographic group of vinyls.
But my findings show that at least the consequences of YouGov are true in Soho's plate stores; the number of women who are more, actually, in the plate stores or in the translation forums are not included in the accounts of women's collections and vinyls.
These people probably work very hard at school or at offices.
These people definitely don't spend the night in the parking lot in Berwick Caddes, and they don't run away from the eyes of a 30-year-old TV server looking at the middle of a crowd of people who don't know anything about anything.

The French court rejected the request for the destruction of stores in the Jungle State Camp
A court in France rejected the offer made by the Calais authorities to destroy the warehouse and the restaurant in the jungle, where thousands of residents live.
In the trial that took place this week, the Calais authorities warned that a total of 72 litres should be destroyed by the sale of a lot of products from the government's people in the camp, cut hair cuts, or sell 50 cents (40p) of basic food for tea or several euros.
Calais Valiggio, who created a parallel economy that did not pay taxes, and risked fire and hygiene.
The relief groups explained that the lives of the stores and restaurants were important to the courts, government-supported organizations and other groups were not enough to feed free food in the camp.
Stores and restaurants have prevented them from entering the frequently needed and providing free food.
A court in Lille stated that it was not a legal basis for people working in a 72-day strike store to be excluded from a legal basis, but that the concerns of Calais Valis can be "not fully understood."
Dr. Jean-François Molla said that there is a much greater role to play in people who live in "suddenly dangerous roads" than in those who live in "suddenly dangerous roads".
He said that these areas provided a peaceful meeting for the graduates and sincere people.
The book Coffee, which is one of the most dangerous places in the world, offers 200 subjects a day, offers English and French lessons and offers advice on the litigation of hundreds of unrecorded children in the camp.
The man over 170,000 signed a petition to protect this coffee for children.
In a letter sent to Guardian, this closure was meant to be a tragedy for some of these children under the age of eight."
Two wells, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des migrats, on Friday, came up with a view to 9,000 of the peaks in the Jungle camp (up to today).
After gold in Fiji's gold class, Britain won a silver medal at the seven rugby championship
The dramatic development of Great Britain at Rugby 7's Championship, which was held at the end of the day with Fiji, ended after the 43-7th anniversary of Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji has provided the first gold medal for the first Olympic medal in each color for the race, the foot, the side, the support, the speed lines, and the lead force.
After the update, Britain received the third silver coin of the day as a non-remarkable welcome, and it can now be proud of the efforts they have shown in the 7th Olympic opening tournament in New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, seven or five additional items may have been found at the end of the day after South Africa's Egypt.
But again, a Fiji that's in this shape could even have a 15-person team.
Even if it is not very convincing, it may be comforting to think that Britain will have at least one British gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's main coach, Ben Ryan, a British Englishman from Wimbledon.
This has been a very difficult journey for Great Britain.
Six ways before, they had worked with Ryan, they had lost every game in the Adelaide Seventh Championship.
This time, they lost only one.
The progress that has been shown is truly surprising, even though it is life - threatening.
Fiji, it's a big start, players, and it's been a while since the Great Britain's collective engagements.
It was like running between a number of moving cars for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and the World Series Championships took 5-0 over the Osea Colinsao coast.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai came out with another number on the right side.
The game was 12-0 and the Great Britain couldn't touch any more.
Mitchell's great adventure, like the mountain, was preceded by the third shot by Leon Nakarawa, but it was just to slow down Fiji's number.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalu made a right-hand count, and Great Britain fell back 17-0.
When the first half ended in just one minute, Nakarawa made another number from the beginning.
Later, Vatemo Ravovovovó, a number of violent British giants, flew across the line.
With this number, it reached a score between 29 and 0.
When a team set up to play the 7th Fiji Championship, Great Britain was still trying to learn the basics of the work.
That's the way it's going down.
Great Britain made big changes and closed the Fiji bar for four minutes, which was not a good development until Joshua Tuisova was able to complete the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton was in an attempt for Great Britain and tried to draw numbers from the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the players were in the hands of the South Sea States singing, dancing, and dancing.
It was really hard not to feel surprised at Fiji's approach to the end of the world.
Maa Vilame also found the latest additions to the Fiji game, which doesn't need to be sucked in the last few minutes.
When the storm broke, the Fijians started to celebrate, and the Great Britain set the way for the winter room.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji invaded Japan in the middle of the final 20-5, and Great Britain faced a difficult half final encounter with South Africa; Britain took the lead in a single number.
Kyle Brown, the first half of South Africa's team, and the second half of the number that Dan Norton took on with his back movements.
Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who took his place in the first 15th of England, was guaranteed a silver medal with the wonderful gift of Marcus Watson.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, who were inspired by their coaches to fight cancer
There'll be no more sensitive gold medals in these games, and this also makes an important point.
In the afternoon of the first round, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning discovered that it would be much more meaningful to understand the memory they won in the Lagoa.
There were three voices on the board, although there were two people who drew their wings, and there were three voices in the boat, and there were two women in England, the first women to reach this kind of level this year.
The authorities were so clear that it was 39th of their divorce order that they were not seen as their wife.
We see two great sports on the edge of the cave, but it's not exactly the purpose of this view.
There's a wall behind every piece of gold that's made up of this difference, and no hand was as effective as the coaches who didn't know they'd live to see this day as long as 30 months ago.
Like he said, they've touched and gone.
I was caught with a kind of cancer that could be treated with surgery, and they did it.
If they don't, they're going everywhere.
This would be a very bad situation.
It changes your outlook on life a little bit.
He spoke to Williams on Wednesday, 2013.
She was very lucky that she was able to start treatment early in 2014, and she didn't know if there was a true statement in these cases, but she would be able to get at least some attention in this way.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better.
It was an encouragement to me.
I was in the hospital, and despite telling them I had a few steps to take, I was walking up to six, nine, 15 meters in the woods.
That's how it started.
Screaming is a road to itself, but it's a little bigger.
After Zafer, he was in Williams, who had been talking a little bit more than usual to express his own concerns.
Stanning, who was the leader of the United Kingdom Summit and who had gone to Afghanistan earlier, said, "I've been in a state of emotional loss this week, maybe this is a bit extreme, but it really means a lot."
That's what this means for me and Helen, and how much Robin and I work together again.
I spent three years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't have. That's why I want to thank him for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better man or a better coach to work.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost five years.
The second is that they hold a strong rhythm that their rapists can't reach.
The power of Stanning and Glover, the last 500 meters between New Zealand and Denmark, has not yet been lost.
We got ourselves covered by that mother.
Helen was calling 'sirious watch, watch the clock'.
It's really important not to get caught.
We had a good start, and we weren't trying to do something incredible.
We didn't expect air files to be dropped today, but we just wanted to win the race we went out and we did it.
Two, he'll call a year before he decides what he's gonna do in the future.
Glover's got a wedding to attend next month, and his own TV show and Steve Backshall's.
Right now, he just wants to make it fun.
I didn't mean to say it was my last fight.
This would make a lot of pressure.
It took me six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was so new and I was very stressed.
It's been here for about four minutes.
That's a much better feeling."

Bulgaria 8th Month First Explanation Rates of Inflation · Global Voices
Global statistics show that the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was %1 in the month of Haziran.
This is the highest value that has been seen over the years (this year since 2012) that we've spent the year with positive %0.2 after the first value that has been seen on the horizon since October.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - December 2016) was %0.8 when compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - December 2015).
In 2016, when Haziran was compared to 2016, it was %101.0, i.e. monthly inflation was at 1.0 level.
Since the beginning of the year, the rate of inflation (Temmus comparison with the mid-2015) has been %0.2 and the rate of monthly inflation between 2016 and Tammuz 2015 has been %0.2.
When compared with the previous month in 2016, the following consumer groups were tested for price increases: Guda and non-alcoholic beverages (%1,7), access (%1,8), entertainment and culture (%6,3), restaurants and hotels (%1,2), possible property and services (%0.3).
The clothing and shoes (%2.2), furniture, household and routine care (%0.5) and health groups (%0.1) were paid.
They drank alcoholic beverages and all cotton, cotton, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels; prices remained at the same level in the media and educational groups.
Snapchat "Anime" effect, Darkened as Basic Caret
Snapchat says it's inspired by the animes for this filter, but some observers say it's insensitivity in a radical way.
Snapchat, with a mercenary, ensures that 150 million cyclists can play at absolute level every day by changing the reality of the user's reality.
You can turn yourself into a mother, a dog, or a Roy Lichtenstein character.
The insects are unique and unique tools that make up the growth of 30 million people every day.
The wrong steps are soon to be made to memory of the law.
Snapchats faced crimes that supported the black classification of the application in the past, or the white-whited-whited art tones of beauty.
That's why this week, because of the Lens that makes it attractive, dark, and cold, some companies have made it a "Asian mask" to carcarize the Asians.
And they were wondering that the company did not indicate a greater issue with regard to diversity.
News and stories were published on Wednesday with The Verge and Motherboard's news, and one day he heard Snapchat removed his property.
The company was in an explanation: Mercek, not to be caricatured by the people of the East, was prepared with a sense of humor.
However, for observers who were tested by the radiation, this smell reminded the painful steroids of the soul.
The other people generally refused to compare my mother.
Grace Sparapani, a former U.S. art student and tweeted about photos, said in an e-mail that her e-mail address was "the pain and frustration of a simple expression."
"The anger added that when it comes to comparing the effects of the filter with the underlying character, it is difficult to argue.
And this shows that the filter is not just a basic mask, but a basic mask at the same time.
Snapchat, it's not the only company that's going through cultural-ticking mechanisms.
The American culture, the community's meetings from the rooms of Hollywood and all the devices that we carry in our hands are seen in an endless conflict of diversity and capriciousness.
And what Snapchat is doing can be achieved in a way that they can be in the hope of a higher status.
In a report on Friday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu, one of Snapchat's clients, said, "It's much harder not to see this kind of action as a tool."
On Friday, Mrs. Zhu, the director of a product company working for the Media, decided to delete Snapchat's account, and everyone called in this way.
In the article written for the media and on the phone report, he expressed his belief that the conflicts with the Red had intensified in Snapchat's work on various kinds of issues.
Ms. Zhu, the majority of the company ended up with a label saying: #SnapchatiSilin.
Ms. Zhu, an American from China, said: "They can make such decisions because there are not enough different types of noises between them, or even those who work there and people who think different noises are not as safe or as safe as they can talk to themselves."
Other observers also share their views on this complaint that Snapchat had left behind in the big part of Snapchat.
The company doesn't share the figures on the variety between its staff by putting the private company on hold.
On Friday, the Snapchat refused to share the root roots of the population, but according to a statement, the company was committed to increasing its activity in order to focus on populations not represented in sufficient order shortly before.
Ms. Zhu pointed out to himself that she would keep the Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if you don't need more users like us to say it's not true."
The Congress panel said that the Army has approved the use of ISD.
In a report published on June, a Congress panel, the United States of America, reported that the United States has described a better picture of the war against the Islamic Government in Iraq and Syria.
A report by the Military Services Committee of the United States, the Committee for Justice and the Legal Affairs of the High Commissioner for Defence has been prepared by a working arm of the Communicating Committee, stating that the US forces have changed the values of the Islamic Government of the United States of America.
Centcom is a military leader in the Central Command, Tampa, Fla., who controls American military operations in Central and Central Asia.
In a report section, the following statements were quoted: "The results of the UN's efforts to promote the environment are typically more positive than the results of the analysis by the major Centcom leaders, and are more positive than the results of the analysis of the other elements of the population's prosperity."
California's Communist Ken Calvert said, "What is in Centcom is unacceptable; we are in trouble with the poor analysis of the above-mentioned decisions."
The leadership failure in Centcom has reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also explained the remaining problems in 2014 and 2015 in the analysis of the United States' efforts to train the Iraqi forces.
Although there are no certain evidence that the great Obama government has ordered the change of reports by its experts, it is clear that the analysts are also aware of the threat of the creation of the Islamic Government of the Union and of the United States of America.
In the report, "In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press groups, brains and congressional expressions were more positive in terms of record value than physical events".
For example, a Centcom expert stated that a major military attack on Muslims' return in May 2015 could be carried out in an early period by Nisan or May 2015.
Musul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic Government.
Kansa's Communicator Mike Pompeo said in an office, "This is especially understood after months of research."
From mid-2014 until mid-2015, the United States of America has managed to launch the UN's most high-performance leadership, in order to minimize the threat posed by the ISIS in Iraq.
Communicators have developed a working tool after they learned that analysts have voiced their concerns about the wishes of the Islamic government.
As the attacks continue, the report published on Friday will be followed by much more detailed findings.
There is also another Centcom petition that is carried out by the General Court of Defence.
The members of the Committee on Democracy also published their own findings, which included the results of the Community's work force on Friday.
The Committee's Democratic Vice-President Adam B. Schiff said that "the last stage in assessing the wishes of Centcom, DAES and Iraq's Security Forces in 2014-2015 has created a more significant period."
Mr. Schiff said that this period "has delayed the publication of the results of the study", it opened the way for moral corruption among analysts and "has not given enough room for debate."
However, Mr. Schiff and Democrats said they did not reach a finding that the results of the White Saray's Centcom analysts were "predicted or politically informed".
The results of the Congress's inception were announced by Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, New York Times reported that there was a general investigation of the Pentagon infection in the wake of the complaints made by the New York Times and Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Lieutenant Patrick Evans, a pentagon speaker, said that the Security Department would not take a position on the Congress report during the period during which general infection continued.
However, he said, "in some cases, citizens will be in a position to disagree on the complexity of the data and support the health dialogue of the Security Council with the population of the UN with regard to this important millennium security features."
Research, Iraq and Syria will alert the border to the fact that the bomb operation in the United States did not continue in the past (a dispute raised by more defence power every day).
However, the crimes committed last year raised the question of how much military operations can be trusted in Central Komuta in order to assess the accuracy of the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Despite the fact that many analysts, Gregory Hooker, and President George W. Bush, have found little power in Iraq and have written an article that states that after the earthquake in 2003, there is little power in Iraq and that it is not enough to think of it in 2003 and that it has been discussed for a long time.
Mr. Hooker has played an important role when it comes to the will of the Islamic government at the same time.
Despite the comments made by Mr. Hooker's team last year by the government of Islam, the authorities stated that they had built temporary refineries to sell oil in the carbora against the raffles in which the Islamic government had been operating.
However, this finding did not go out of the Centre of Comuta, as The Times indicated on Monday.
Centcom's team back then, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was surprised to learn that the statement in the Senate was last seen as a positive assessment of the war by many legislators.

U.S. Women ready to meet with Brittany The Black Horse Team Back to the 4th Spring
Katie Bam, one day after perhaps three shots against Japan, the U.S. Women's first two shots of the U.S. team on December 3-0 against India.
It's like there's a permanent silence in two games, but Bam (27) said he wasn't sure he didn't do the same thing before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not from people who keep their hands.
You know, the Americans are sharing the first class of the group with Britain, who continued their journey week after 2 to 0 from the 4 to 0 of the Olympic tournament.
The United States of Great Britain and the United States will come against the final game on Saturday.
Both teams had the right to go to the finals, and the game, six team games, will determine who first and who will finish the second.
The team that first finished the group games will not face a little longer with a powerful team leader in the Netherlands.
But after Friday's party, the Americans created a feeling of amazing progress here after the last of the 12 teams came to London Olympics.
I was in this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.; he was 3 when he first took his hat and was the youngest player of the team in Drexel when he was 16 years old.
He lost his 2008 Olympics because he couldn't get into the last cadre.
Then came 2012 when he and his team friends didn't go on a lot of things.
The following year, an English coach Craig Parnham was introduced, and things began to change.
Bam says "a global change, a mental change, a physical change."
We're not working like London anymore.
We've been through my turn.
On Friday night, Bam, he took the first number of the first half of the first round of a series of attacks.
The Indian tournament had not yet gained a chance, but the team was able to defend itself as 1-0 as a third of the trees around Bam.
He made a long race from the left of the palace, and then he jumped into the middle of the tower, and the Americans went through 2 to 0.
Melissa Gonzales, he's finally hit the middle of the fourth plant.
This was the first game that Jackie Briggs, a U.S. secretary of the U.S. government who allowed each other in the first three stages, didn't eat the ball in the tournament.
It's open.
So does Bam.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place now," but it's about the end of Friday's day.
Trambolism in the middle of the Olympic Games
Wherever you are, no matter how long, the Olympics continue.
The activities in Rio de Janeiro represent a full recovery and work, and it's as if it's never going to end or run away.
It's like an avalanche of the Olympics, from the front of the Olympics, from there to the gymnastics, to the triathlon.
Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos can't watch television without hearing anything about the crash between them, don't read the newspaper, or listen to what your neighbor said in a coffee shop.
And there is Logan Dooley.
For the first time, Mr. Dooley may be one of the names that have been shown in the hours of springtime between TV ads that tell you how you feel about the Olympics.
But Lake Forest, from California, Mr. Dooley (28) is fighting for gold medals in the Olympics.
The Olympics don't explain every activity at the same level.
Far from the center, there are some sports that are not known to be universally on the island: air firefighting, volleyball, badminton, tekvando.
The sacrifice will always be with us, and it will be with us for a long time.
But if I have to specify what I like most as a person, I want to pay attention to the secret size of the trampoline.
No matter how much the trampoline has been identified in Sidney games since 2000 as an Olympic activity, the few people I've asked in the past 16 years didn't realize that this was an Olympic track.
This could be a regional facility.
The United States had never won a medal in the race, and it had not won a competition until 2012 at the end.
Among the men were Chinese and Russian, and among the women there were Chinese and Canadians.
Dong Dong from China and Canada, Rosie MacLennan will try to protect the gold medals they bought in London this year.
However, the habit of trambolin is considered to be a serious activity, so it may be thought that you are in the hands of the Olympics rather than the Olympics.
I have to admit that I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested in the matter.
There's a comical potential (such as the rhythm of a series of film that has never been finished), but it also spreads the imagination of the two sports that bring together the basics.
The word "trabbolin" comes from the Spanish word "trappoline", which means "tramplen."
Champagne is about 30 feet high on a large trampoline and wants them to move a couple of moves (burm, pike, and salto) before they fall on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are valued for their performance, for their violence, and for their "flight period".
In Rio, 16 men from 17 countries and 16 women will fight thirty-two athletes.
Make sure the most of the frequent advances in the Olympics are true.
Those who believe in taking up the medal should go back to the end of some of their gold contests, and in some cases they should go back, longer, faster, and higher.
They're not just the finish line or the start-up wall, they have another hard line on television; the world or the Olympic record.
It's a tremendous effort, it's in extreme degrees, and it's enough to put a monitor in their eyes.
But it's one of the little things I've found in my mind when I've been watching the Games.
Trambolin, it's all you can do.
Those in the trampoline move the top right.
Their goals are not moving forward.
He turns up straight, looks like an astronaut, then comes up, and then comes down, and once again he doesn't want to.
Of course, it cannot be said whether it's recapitalated or it's not hard to say that it's only a waste of work, a loss of distance, to reach the end of the routine, but it's just a dream of time and place to be taken into action in a way that's bad.
A Olympic competition can be as heavy as it is.
The women's sequences and then the finals will be arranged at 1 p.m. at 3 p.m. and men's Friday at 13 p.m.
The NBC will be released every two days from 14 a.m. as a block after the end of each day.
In the middle of the darkness of the Olympics, they promise to be seen in the general garden without voice and a wonderful moment.
And according to the U.S. Wall Street Journal, if the United States is going to increase its ability to watch and invent a man's toys just as he suggested for a short time, we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for the new monsters.
For a long time, in Ethiopia, U.S. National Protestoda, Ethiopia, U.S.A.
Protests in Ethiopia
The political reformers in Ethiopia faced the government's violent regime.
The witnesses say a lot of the protestor's got a deadly gun job in a fight with the police.
Are you going to Ethiopia?
In the past ten years, one of Africa's most fragmented countries has been a healthy security for the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But the government against the protesters that we've been doing in the past months has spread across the country more and more every day.
Just last week, thousands of people were in demand for basic political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's attitude toward this was not very bad.
The witnesses said that the police members had shot and killed the gunman in a lot of numbers.
In protest scenes that were thought to be from the end of the past year or from the beginning of this year, there are young people who have to stand up against a wall.
The United Nations, the highest level of human rights, wants a detailed investigation now.
Rashid Abdi, project director of the Somali Project of the International Crisis Group, a research group, said: "It's always hard to keep this country together and it's going to be harder to move."
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is one of the highest countries in Africa, and the exception is to be determined by the West.
America's military and volunteer services are working closely with Ethiopian people to combat terrorist threats to Somalia, primarily, and there are very few countries in West Africa who have seen this tremendous aid.
Ethiopia's economy is growing in an efficient way.
The basement has been improved in an active way, and there is a new bathroom train in Addis Ababa.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
As far as Ethiopia was concerned, the country had to be very limited by its best example of democracy (which was constantly under pressure by human rights groups) and was actively underpinned by the media.
Most of them were sent to prison, jailed, killed, or sent to the most distant villages in the country.
But this may be about changing.
Seyoum Teshome, a university student from Central Ethiopia, said, "If you don't give people a choice, these things will happen."
Youth is completely protesting.
A generation protest.
There are so many complaints about the strong pressure of the coalition that it has to use.
After our last year's high-level election, he also took over the party and the privileges, the last column of the delegates, and now he can control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, in the month of Haziran, hundreds of people are being forced to join the army, with Eritrea, who has lost their lives in battle.
Analysts fear that in the years that we have passed as the Oromo Freedoms Chapter or the Ogaden National Freedoms Centre, groups from the Middle East are being re-armed using this disorder.
There are a number of factors that explain why the painful feelings of suffering under the face have been spreading over the years.
The first seems to be suspicious: smart phones.
Only a few years ago, when cheap phones became available and Internet service was available, Ethiopian social media began to communicate in large numbers.
The government was able to communicate with Internet service providers who were more than able to access Facebook and Twitter, as they often did in protest times.
A few young Ethiopians, he said they gathered in this way for protestors.
Secondly, there was a growing conflict between the Oromos and the Amharas, the two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia.
Oromos and Amharas are not normally safe.
For a long time, the Amharas had been occupying the Oromos, many of whom had been Muslims and in the right ways, in their political and business assignments, from the mountainous regions of Ethiopia.
But this is also changing.
Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader, said, "We are going to meet under one shadow and cooperate."
The largest protesters were seen in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most think that Amhara and Oromo, Ethiopia, formed about 6 percent of the population, and that the military, volunteer services, trade and politics, have been wrongly dominated by members of the Tigrian ethnic group.
The third reason why Meles Zenawi died after he fell asleep.
Former Israeli leader Mr. Meles has served as head of Ethiopia for 17 years until the death of an unexplained disease in 2012.
Seeing that everyone couldn't see, he thought there was a tactical device.
Analysts say he's an expert on not detecting the first signs of his absence, and not comforting and inspiring him.
Competition analyst Mr. Abdi said, "I don't have this basic knowledge."
The new head of Ethiopia, Haelmariyam Desalegn, was elected in ignorance to fill Mr. Meles' place.
Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigriry region of northern Ethiopia, is the west of Mr. Hailemariam.
Analysts say the security services controlled by the Tigris have not been trusted.
As a result, more and more blood was shed.
Ethiopia's final experience in this kind of conflict was a protest after the attacks by thousands of analysts in 2005 following a presidential election.
In the past, as far as we've been concerned, many protesters have been killed, and this conflict cycle has gone faster.
The geologists, Ethiopia's leaders, have been trained to plan video subsidized and to make significant progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is obvious that this did not stop the increase of the enemy government in Ethiopia.
And that's a dangerous and ethical thing.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, the city of Amhara, attacked the business of the Tigrian people, and Tigrayan's hatred also increased in social media.
Analysts, protests in the United States and other security forces in the West say they're leaving a strange situation.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a top for non-human aircraft flying around Somalia, but it said it was closed a short time ago.
Although the West wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to be split up in a region that is currently broken.
Mr. Abdi said "This" and added, "It's like walking on a lot of snow."
Donald Trump explained that Obama's idea of creating the ISD was "a deal."
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, several times a week ago, President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to remove the last aspect of the campaign from the middle of the campaign, assuming that the Islamic terrorist group was not serious.
This explanation raised new questions about the fact that the President of the Society was openly communicating with the people of the United States.
At the same time, during the time that this cargo was created to defend it, they also tried to explain to the people that they were building to defend it.
Mr. Trump, after a meeting on Wednesday night, he was shocked that he had actually built Mrs. Clinton's ISIS on Friday, and that he was actually building it on Friday.
But on Friday morning, he said he was only in a reasonable statement by Mr. Trump.
The message showed that Mr. Trump had taken the whole step back a day before he said he was serious about this crime.
Hugh Hewitt, the director of the radio programme, said that when Mr. Obama tried to help him relax this trend, he did not believe the President of the Community in this case.
Mr. Trump, trying to change the camp's room after the polls broke out.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had a conversation this week about the economy in Michigan.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to return to this matter again.
Speaking again on Twitter, Mrs. Clinton said that she would increase the taxes and find that she was able to speak more often.
Mr. Trump used to defend the defense.
Right at the end of the month of December, when the Russians attacked Ms. Clinton's e-mails, they met with great reactions, saying, "Of course, I've said it in a way that makes sense."
This is close enough to make Mr. Trump's policy-making restrictions enforce and take back where he needs to be.
Ruth Sherman, a communication expert in both languages, said: "It's an arrangement that allows you to "explain" in a way that allows the message to be "explained" by those who support it."
But at the same time, he knows these brains and he knows that when they look at them from different angles, they're not as specific as they are to be filtered.
In the past few days, I've had a lot more attack on the air than it was for the general election.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published on Friday showed that Ms. Clinton was in the vicinity of North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado and that there was a frequent conflict in Florida.
As long as Mr. Trump avoids asking for forgiveness for what he usually says, he is guilty of making a mistake or not understanding what he is saying.
But in the last few months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes, which have been too much to encourage, leave the remaining loyal supporters in a difficult situation to support.
Former New York City president Rudolf W. Giulian, one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, did his best to defend the island on Friday with CNN.
When Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton asked about your honesty in the way that the Islamic government has created it, Mr. Giulian said, "Bence is a political factor."
In a way, Obama was a small organization that had not been known before, and it was completely wrong to find them, and that was why the soldiers were expelled from Iraq.
Most of those who have gone out of the community, Mrs. Clinton's foreign minister, are trying to prevent Obama's regime from prospering aggressively in the Middle East and why ISIS is growing.
On Friday, before the rounds to be held in Pennsylvania, Trump Twitter continues to attack every word he says and accuses him of acting against him.
He said, "They can't do this."
Some Democrats said that it was evidence that Mr. Trump was in favour of the bank.
Enjoy a New Life in a Coffee Greenpoint, Not Pretended With Sacrifices
The Verb Cafe Wi-Fi, an old-fashioned place that only worked with salt in Williamsburg, was a great coffee for 15 years without knowing it.
Of course, he didn't have any deals at the Bedford Avenue store.
In 2014, Soap Cherie, who took the place of Verb, sells soaps in the form of coffee.
The inhabitants of the region came near to say that this was the last of the city to be visited.
The writer Molly Crabapple wrote to Twitter, "I'm a New Yorker, but I don't believe that the CBGB is gone, and Chelsea Hotel is now a port store."
But it's a city to re-crease as long as New York has changed.
In November of our last month, Greenpoint opened a newly renovated Verb Cafe in less than a mile from its original point of view.
It has a new Verb Cafe Wi-Fi connection and accepts a credit card, but it protects some former employees and the same simple air.
The coffee's good.
At the beginning of the new Verb, the former captain's long-term employer, Cisco Rodriguez, has a new location and general manager.
He was involved in Verb in 2001, and he stayed there until the end.
A client said he'd be thrilled to do this when he offered to finance himself for this new place.
Mr. Rodriguez (36) left much the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for simulations and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
Even the lights of old Verb were used here again.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted a little different experiments.
He added new maladies.
The translucent-ve-refined sandwiches are also decorated with such materials as hats and lattices.
There's esmer-principal cases.
Coffee doesn't do beer service anymore, but it's just the fresh fruit water.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he realized that the former warriors had begun to come in a decisive manner.
He said, "Many of our old customers didn't happen with the prices in Williamsburg."
The other day, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Ms. Oliveira (34) lives in Williamsburg and often goes to Verb.
After she was moved to Greenpoint, she didn't give up on this path.
He said he'd called for a cup of coffee for a while after the verb closed.
He said, "I realized that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb. "
Now she started to drink coffee again, but the day before, she chose a new bottle of tea instead of a new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another advocate, went to Verb in 2003 on a regular basis.
She went there before work and always gave her the same clothes.
He said, "Every day, I would eat of it and drink of it, and I would not be thirsty, but I was preparing for the sun's setting."
The photograph said Mr. Rodriguez wanted to change and add new items to the menu.
Today, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his usual driver, but sometimes he makes a bit of a change in his daily dress, his sweating, and his hair.
Mr. Rodriguez said that he wasn't in the bathroom where he took his place.
In fact, Soap Cherie's owners offered to make a special hall for Verb using the coffee that the coffee was cold.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer."
And Greenpoint's prospective Polish residents were my coffee.
One of the new clients translated the menu into Lehce and said that Mr Rodriguez would soon find a field that would cure the menu so that new neighbors would feel better.
There are other advantages in my new subject.
The local fruit store wants to mix and sell freshly baked coffee.
There's a chance that the ceiling will expand to a complete building.
It's enough that a new Verb exists to find old favorites for most clients.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client, and he was very sad after the space was closed.
When the new space was opened, Mr. Whitt went in and said he felt that he could get some coffee at home.
He said, "I should have picked this up."
In the book "A Square Meal" of the Depression of the Crisis
In March 1933, shortly after the President's seat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for dinner at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, who was one of those who fell down on his neck, loved to eat like the fish's milk and Maryland's fatty fish.
The day's menu was much more motivative: domates in green soil, potatoes powder, and sweet powder.
Jane Ziegelman said, "This was not an option to deal with people who are depressed."
His wife, Andrew Coe, added, "It was a message to the Americans about how to eat at the same time."
The guy who lives in Brooklyn Heights is a food historian.
Mr. Coe's last book was about "Chop Suey" in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman was talking about eating the lives of the nights in the Netherlands.
The "A Square Meal" that they worked together and the "A Square Meal" will be published by Harper on Tuesday tells the history of America's food in the Great Depression.
Since 1929 when the crisis has begun, they have also met with a guest at Eisenberg Sandvic Buffet, located in the Flatiron region.
Ms. Ziegelman (54), while preparing cream with a peachy and oily sandwich, preferred Mr. Coe (57), India, potatoes powder and cheese.
Both of them found it appropriate to discuss the daily routine of the emperor's cholera.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "The Somuns were very popular."
And the earth had grass, and the fruit of the trees, and the fruit of the ground, and the fruit of the ground, and the fruit of the ground, and the increase of the trees, and the increase of the trees, and the increase of the trees of the field.
These were made of an air-conditioned object that spreads the material with a material.
Think of the place you ate until you had enough to eat at dinner.
Mr. Coe, he's got his face on.
He said, "You must have sat in the middle of a man like a bird."
In the years before the crisis, in particular in the affected areas, the challenges in America were obvious.
Women were cooking food for men working in the fields, and freshly baked potatoes were served in coffee, lunch, and dinner.
1. The Americans sent food to Europeans who died of hunger in the World War, explaining the history of their way out of the center of hunger.
Mr. Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this, said, "It was a time when food was a central, worrying situation for Americans."
The new beehive region was equally alarming: there was a basic supply of raw food, such as somnolence and safes, which, according to Ms. Ziegelman, "was a great way to assess the leftovers" so that farmers could hide the ingredients under the creamy soybeans.
He took the place of fresh fruit, which is more delicious.
Over the years, it's been in the center of American food, and it's been in a state of complete isolation.
I've tried interesting fights for the calorie and the five values, and I've been through a constant feeling of taste or general muffled understanding.
Ms. Ziegelman, as he was doing research on the book containing the charts, he prepared a full-fledged meal on the floor.
Mr. Coe said, "It wasn't a nice party at dinner table tonight."
Mrs. Ziegelman supported this: "It was true."
There's no part of the match with the ring on the edge of the suit.
This is an important feature in most households' economy.
Between 1923 and 1943, the Federal House Economics Office, which was responsible for Louise Stanley's home economics, led the country's food industry as never before.
The magazines and articles were published in newspapers and newspapers to encourage women to be "saarsurflu" and to promote the struggle to turn their findings into delicious foods, such as air cream spaghetti.
"A Square Meal" is a journey that takes place in the historical history of the L.A.
The results that President Herbert Hoover gave to the government's government's open-ended supporters, such as the postmaster Hoover.
She was eating a simple Iowa farmer's food on one side, and she was eating like a million intellectuals who turned out to be on the other side.
Mr. Coe said, "He loved to eat the sweets of Europe like salty fish."
He was eating in a room with almost all the gold in the dining room at night.
He's so far away from the truth.
His wife, Eleanor, did not encourage him to be an example to his wife, but President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake.
According to the book, with Mrs. Roosevelt's unsatisfied help, she began to smoke in White Saray, "not the most delicious foods, but at the same time, the most deliciously prepared drugs."
After the country returned to its feet, most of the food delivery methods in the crisis were left to one side.
Ms. Ziegelman says that it continues to be used as an appropriate understanding of calorie and breastfeeding and as a means of preparing food for science.
Two times, when writing the book, Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits indicated that she had learned a lot - for example, that food was never trashed.
Mr. Coe said, "It was really scary for him to eat."
Ms. Ziegelman, she said of her former mother, "She really hurt people."
He's got a cremation.
After the shootings in Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe, brought out the sweets they had prepared in the house, and they ate the sweet sweet sweets that President Roosevelt ate at dinner.
Ms. Ziegelman said, "It seems to be the most common number that has been added to it, and it was to give an air-conditioned name to the motifs.
There was no broken cream; only we're dry, a little butter, sugar, water and rice.
Everyone squeaked out of it by finding a cup of coffee.
It wasn't so bad in a surprising way.
Mr. Coe, he took his second and third.
He said to his wife, as if he could be able to design it, "It'd be good to have a piece of broken tissue."
With Merck, Hepatit C will receive his lawyer's contributions at the patent contest
According to the U.S. District Justice, Gilead Sciences Inc, a medical author, Merck & Co Inc, was entitled to receive legal benefits in connection with the hepatitis C patent case.
After finding out that Dr. Merck’s false witness and other foreign applications were involved in some wrong conduct, he was forced to pay 200 million dollars for the two Merck patents for Gilead, which had made a great success in the month of Harvoni.
On Friday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that he had the right to be prosecuted for crimes committed during the trial of Gilead.
Merck is trying to grow up to Gilead, a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can improve more than 90 percent of cancer patients.
Dava, Gilead and Merck continue to claim the property of the labs that they claim to have worked for the active substance of the medicinal products of Gilead, sofosbuvir.
US-supported forces have expressed that Membiç's control is completely controlled by the Islamic Government
On Friday, the group speaker, the US-supported forces, also the last Islamic government fighters in the city, said they had completely taken control of the northern Membic city.
After a group of soldiers left behind in the city of the Democratic Forces (SDG) in Syria was separated, the city was cleaned up.
In an interview with SDG, Sharfan Derviš, from the Membic Army Council, told Routers that they had released the civilian heritage of their own military forces in 2000.
He said to Routers, "We're only doing cleaning work under our control now."
Clinton's family won $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the federal tax in 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton explained on Friday that the Democratic Republicans won 10.75 million dollars a year and that they paid the federal tax at 34.2 a year.
In 2015, the Clinton family, most of whom contributed $1 million to the Dublin Vaccf, received nearly $5.3 million from former President Bill Clinton's talks, and announced that Simon & Schuster had received $3 million for the publication of the book that he had published in the East Bank for the period he had spent on the East Bank.
Clinton's aide friend, Senator of the United States, Tim Caine, from Virginia, published his 10-year-old tax agent with Anne Holton.
In 2015, the federal tax was paid at 20.3 p.m.
In a member of the Clinton campaign, Jennifer Palmieri said, "The Hills of Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial security."
In addition, Donald Trump is hiding behind false accusations and taking steps to explain the charges he has already made.
It is an opportunity for the U.S. Presidents to pay their taxes openly to you.
Trump and the lawyers, a workman in New York, said that it was a test carried out by the Geller Bureau to refuse the release of the organs.
Ian Sams tweeted "You're on the ground" in connection with the members of the Clinton campaign.
On Friday, Trump said that he would not allow him to publish these until the CNN's controls were completed.
In 2012, the Communists, Mitt Romney and other Communists, also included the Group, expressed their own independence, their independence, their business agreements, and many other concerns about their involvement with Russia.
Clinton published a revolutionary video showing that the top-level community members were using the press to explain their contributions to Trump on Friday.
On Friday, in a economic conversation held in Michigan, he asked about it.
He said to the rich, "He refuses to do what every prince has done over the years, and to publish his taxes."
Politico reported that Trump had never paid taxes in the 1990s for almost two years, and on Friday, the New York Times worked on a series of tax attorneys, and he shared his comments that the situation of the reporter could continue this way.
The federal tax situation was an important issue in the presidential election.
Clinton made a regular offer, called Warren Buffet, that would pay at least 30 hours a million dollars a year for those who won a million dollars a year.
President Obama supports this offer too.
Last week, at a Clinton match in Nebraska, Omaha, Berkshire Hathaway group, there was an interview with Buffett, Trump, who showed up there.
Buffet said he was going through the IRS test and not from Trump's tax administration, but from the voters.
Clinton published his tax officers in the campaign until 2007.
New York, the Clinton family living in Chappaqua, has now paid the federal average tax by approximately 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 and reaching approximately 40,5 per cent.
Clinton's family's brain for 2015 is to show that most Americans have only 100 dollars of money.
The main investment is a low-malistic direct investment fund, and Clinton's family has declared it to be $109,000.

Fresh red condoms, chestnuts support the protection of eggs in Tanzania
Environments in Tanzania use a method that has not been taken to prevent farmers from entering human areas; they have to put them in hot red condoms.
It was proved to be effective and this idea was taken a few years ago by Honeygude Vakf and the U.S. Central Security Union; it began to learn about the use of non-violent and non-violent ways of protecting their homes and their pets from harming them in northern Tanzania.
Most people used to defend themselves before.
On Friday, World Trade Day, which is devoted to the protection of animals.
Director-General Damian Bell said in one office, "We have seen that this has changed the attitudes of these groups since we have developed the Middle East; now there are more freedom to keep out of the ranks of unharmed farmers."
The first two steps include holding the last file down and playing the grid.
In situations where this is not possible, what is called "red bead powder".
The dust red bean mixed with the dust, puts condoms with a chestnut, just shuts down the air so that it can be opened.
The condom opens with a blast sound and pours red beads into the air as dust.
It's enough for a breath of fresh air to send it to the surface.
The last thing to do is to use an air-conditioned airship, a high voice, a light flash.
The Jewish filmmaker, who shot Israel's phone code on "talibi" on the Arab side, shot out of the hotel in Berlin - RT News
A Jewish former French filmmaker, Kempinski Bristol, in Berlin, opened his way to the media reconnaissance after opening up the telephone code of Israel's Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin and bringing out the "traps" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, from the authors of the "Shoah" document on the subject, expressed his sympathy to the Campinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter written by the German publishing body to the FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of telephone codes that the hotel had recently been providing.
But the country did not take a place between the states that could actually be called from the room.
In 2016, how can Israel be left out and destroyed in Berlin, the president of the new Germany?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol, Israel, is the one who calls on the centre of his call.
The filmmaker told the hotel's reception to get an explanation.
Lanzmann, he wrote that he was "sucking."
The hotel's secretary said that this schedule was taken by the Kempinski-Hotels administration.
It's why the filmmaker is sitting under this motion, and it's why he's getting so excited.
As Lanzmann pointed out, he said, "Most of our colleagues wanted to remove the code of Arab and Israel."
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's German mayor Yakov Hadas-Handelsman described the situation as "a great shame."
This situation has left us in the dark, and it's amazing.
That's really a big shame.
It's a lot bigger than it's in Germany and in the vicinity of such a hotel.
That doesn't have to be explained.
We're waiting for the hotel to come out of this."
The case was largely alarmed in the revolutionary environment, and people were told this situation as scandalous.
Some accused the Campinski Hotel of "sniffing" the Arab customers' requests.
In another letter, he replaced the phrase "You must move" by shooting at a church near the hotel, in the kurfurstendamm street.
According to Der Spiegel's report, Otel quickly started these crimes by saying that this was the result of "incompatibility" and "inspired" from Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung stated that one of Kempinski's representatives said, "There was no direct order in order not to be included in Israel's Quick Call List."
And now they're adding code.
Police used fuel and plastic paint against Brazilian Protestant students
On Friday, students gathered in the city of Sao Paulo in Brazil met with the police to protest the reforms that the government will make on the education system.
The police used beer gas and plastic paint against the prosthetics.
The problem began when the security officers tried to divide the students, and this opened the way for the police to use plastic paint and beer gas.
Hundreds of students were involved in expressing their discontent with plans.
The Sao Paulo government offered Geraldo Alckmin to cover less than 100 government schools and 300,000 students will be placed in other schools.
Some of the people who were involved in the protest were seen writing on the walls of President Michel Temer, who passed through the walls.
This last protest took place a few days after the protestors were out of the way to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was expelled from the country's Senate.

Russia's Iranian mayor, Levan Dzhagaryan, showed an increase of 70.9 between Moscow and Tahran, with the removal of productions.
The major, since the lack of international action against Iran, has shown that Russian companies working in the country have increased greatly.

Last year, Russia's diplomatic representation in Iran gave 35,000 visas to many Iranian citizens for travel.
In addition, the number of tourists visiting Iran for the first time took place between the first 20 countries.
We can say that the Iranian tourist record that visited Russia last year will be broken."

FETÖ's software from the Index - Economic News
In view of the financial support of FETÖ, the Kavuklar Group Management Board, President Abdullah Kavuk and the Minority Group Management Board, began to issue relevant details regarding Ahmet Smallwa.
FETÖ's 1 and 2 financial resources in Izmir were identified as the first FETÖ/PDY earthquake in Kavuk with the FETÖ/PDY earthquake that regularly charged Fettullah Gülen every month.

10 years of age, 30 thousand lira receptors
President Recep Tayyyy and Erdoğan's call for "fajous download" went to the banks.
First, it was suggested that the banks should be included in the campaign to which the Emelak Konut started and then GYODER was later included in the campaign.
It was also done by President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan, who suggested that one-hundred-of-the-counter credit should be reduced to 1 percent of the psychologically assessed credit items.
The 13 banks took their credit rates below 1 percent.
The bank became a bank when I started my transfer.
More than a hundred months ago, when the monthly interest rates changed from 1.12 to 1.29, the final adjustment will pay less interest between 15 and 30 billion TLs, using 10-year-old accounts credit.
STUDY ARTICLE 5 PAGES 10 - 15
And how much benefit will it bring to those who take the fascinations home?
A man who uses 100 thousand litres of 10-year-old credit will provide 30 thousand litres of interest from the drop.
The majority of those using the count credit choose a 5-10-year-old payout plan.
It's expected that in the days ahead of us, there will be a lot worse than that.
The sales of Faiz will also have an effect.
In 2015, the sales of the product increased by 10.6 percent over the previous year, by 1 million, 289 thousand.
It's expected that this year's sales will exceed 1.5 million by sending me in the last year.
GYODER President Aziz Tower: It must be brought down to the bottom of the 9th century
It's an important step to go to the flats of the Kamu banks.
And they listened to the call of our commander and sent down the beans.
But this thing has to go down to the bottom of nine hundred years.
If this is going to continue, we're going to extend the start of 0.70 percent campaign in the month we started in a few months.
Key Group US Custom Key: Our campaign can extend into 3 months
This participation of our banks in the process of bringing life to the economy that we have limited for one month can lead to a period of at least 3-4 months in the history campaign.
But there's a nine-in-a-year decline in credit phases.
It's also a pleasure to see that every sector has committed a criminal offence in the face of an unprecedented psychological and historical conflict that will create the real market.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It's a good way to go to the president's phone call to the banks.
In addition, there are some steps that can be taken to improve the economy in all sectors.
The campaign by the STKs, the decision taken by the Central Bank, and all the steps taken to this end for the country...
All banks have to put their hands under your nose.
And come to them, and you're going to join this adventure, walk with us, walk along the same path, and we're saying, "Let's live in a free economy."

The traffic gets under the ground, and it's going to send the wind with no certainty.
Tramvay and physique systems will continue to work for a while.
The Battalians' Tassim, Eminno, will be launched in the long run with a view to providing access to the five-year-olds.
Faiz has fallen, home is broken
A bank manager sent a message to my friend.
It's always the same.
It's falling, it's increasing the prices of the house.
Faiz's up, the house's down.
He says, "That's it again."
She's talking about her own feelings about secular credit.
Emak Konut says that many customers who come to the campaign with a 0.10 percent volume volume increase their prices in the project.
I saw if there's any truth.
It's okay, it's okay.
In the meantime, my mind was touched by a conversation with an interview that took place about a week after the 15th anniversary of the entry into work in Temmuz.
The boss of a big company...
When I heard the words, "You're going to have to make 10 percent of the payments," I said, "You're going to make an opportunity?"
Following the entry of the Emak Konut campaign, the builders started a large sales campaign with 0.70 feet and 120 feet per month.
I agree, he put his hand under the bank before the banks, he took the risk.
But, ma'am, we're moving together and with the spirit of cooperation to prevent Turkey's speed.
Banks supported your campaign for 1 month.
Then let no one take advantage of it.
And warn of what you do.
President Erdoğan, Emer Koch and Ali Koch accepted
President Recyp Recyip Erdoğan, Head of the Koch Holding Board, has accepted President Ali Koch's Director of the Bachelor's Association with Mr. Mehmet Koch and Mr. Ford Autosan's Board of Directors.

Call from BDK: Call those banks
President Mehmet Ali Akben, President of the Banking Management and Management Board (BDDK), made a statement on the warning of "a return of credit" to the banks of Erdoğan.
Akben, "We certainly don't allow that if banks turn the money back from the market's demands and turn it into an opportunity to do different jobs."
We're telling those who brought us this kind of complaints and information, "When we name the bank and the company, you're gonna find a way to get to the BDDK complaint line."
President Tayyyyip Erdoğan said yesterday: "I believe that when there are gaps, there will be a new turn in front of our country and investors and banks."
So if you're going to refuse credit in our country this time, it's true that banks that call back the credit, and I want to hear about it.
And when I was 7-8 years old, the banks won money from these things.
500 dear Russian tourists are waiting.
The president of the Professional Hotel Managers' Department (POYD), Ali Küldağ, EXPO 2016, said that the Turkish-Russia relations had entered a valid route before the 15th anniversary of the entry into the region of Antalya, and that they had begun their flights to Antalya from Russia and had experienced a certain livelihood in the tourism.
The meeting of President Recep Taiyi and President Erdoğan, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and the Red Cross, which expressed the enthusiasm for the tourism sector as it was for the two-country trading sectors, "I hope that tourism will be a very positive development in the light of the history and the text from which it is built."
We have a very close relationship between Turkey and Russia, based on years.
He said, "I think that we, as sectors where the leaders of the two countries are opening up, will be able to close the ranks before we can reach goals."
In the absence of access to employment, the Red Cross, who claimed that the number of Russian tourists from Turkey would exceed 1 million, continued:
But we lost a month in the period we said high season, which is why the target was reduced.
I think if the charter flights start again, we'll get 500 thousand numbers.
And the season's team might be talking about the end of the season to the middle of the summer.
In such a situation, extra planes can be spoken to a driver.
I imagine this positive air will be well appreciated by the Russians too.
They also have a feeling of belonging to Turkey.
I'm thinking maybe we're going to make 700 grand.
The Russian market, which expressed its hope for 2017, said that if Russia's economy were to be combined, Russia's economy would be able to reach another 3 million Russia's tourists next year.
The POYD President Red, stating that the people's rights have been removed, that the domestic reserve has begun a small beginning, "There are changes in the restored reservations, and new reservations have also begun to be received."
He said, "We have a hope for the victim's victory."
He said, "It would be good if we could bring 100-200 thousand people from Iran in one month to the next."
Do you want to re-enter existing credit?
First of all, learn how your credit is affected by the new fashion shortcuts you've seen with the bank you've received.
Calculate the amount of a new loan, with the amount of an early payment (up to 1.5-2 per cent of the total amount used) from your bank, at a lower interest rate.
If you still have an advantage when you include all the assets, you can be found in the application for low-fashioned credit.

Hüsein Gülerce: The destruction of the Sun depends on the fall of 3 feet
Hüsein Gülerce, who is about to enter the work, was found in the press release.
The line heads of Hussein Gülerce's explanation:
I wrote this in my last 5 to 6 months, as they're going to get to work, "they can learn, but they can't do it in the command line."
I didn't know two things; the first is that it's so wide and deep, for example, the 8-year command of the General Board and the duties of the Chief of Staff.
Your Highness, the most struggling person, is the one who cares about how everyone cares about their strengths, but it's the most important secret they've ever seen.
They're two-faced.
"It's not a work that can do an amazing thing like this." One of the most important evidence is that it's so deep.
He's getting support from the CIA.
CIA, this guy's got a very early hand.
Mahmut Övür says that in 1971 they met with Fetullah Sun at the home of Wehbi Koç.
That revolution tells the most people involved in these things is the closest relationship between the MIT and the CIA.
That's how our armed forces paid the U.S. personnel' wages, and that's what a man went out of here after he didn't remember them.
When do we learn this in 2014?
And after that Mahmut Bey wrote, there was no such statement as a lie.
For example, the Justice Führer was arrested, wasn't he?
Who's interested in that?
He went to Pennsylvania twice during the last 25 days before work, and he returned two days ago.
Since 2002, justice has gone outside 109 times.
When you bring all of this together, you need to investigate it; now that all the refugees have gone to a bunker with the U.S. since March 1999 when Fatullah went to the U.S. Sun.
Looks like they went to Pennsylvania with a nurse.
But the actual connections with the CIA can be identified from there, and in particular, many people have been sent to the U.S. security from those who need to be lifted from security.
There's Wikileaks' documents; the Sun's creating a collection, and it's working together with the CIA.
15 years ago, there was work to show these connections to the CIA.
I told Fuat Avni Pennsylvania that I had a vacation at a hotel two years ago.
The man who works in the capital is working for Fuat Avni.
But that's bad, and that's what happened to the CIA.
The collapse of the Sun is about three feet apart, one of which we said was a friendly nation, and there are those who are well in the deep hypnotism, even saying that Erdoğan is still a movie.
I was saying three feet, a building support.
The theft of questions, stealing, stealing rights, this building's very expensive support.
Two other feet; political support, international support.
There is still support for your children.
The only thing that's going to break the political support is that Baykal and the MHP managers' accounts have been confirmed by FETÖ.
15 After Tammuz, he used the "FETK" and the Lord's Pentateuch, and he opened the eyes of everyone.
Tomorrow's a number that says, "I don't do it around."
He says to me, "I've been told that these girls are seeing a lot of different dreams, they're sending them to me, and I've already written them, because it's not right to act with dreams."
And there fell a voice, and there was a voice from the voice of one that spake: The voice of one crying in the midst of him was as if it had been a dreamful voice; the two of them were as if they had not had seen the Lord's Son.
There's a police station in Nusaybin.

That's the charming Akkaya...
Akkaya, who explained that during the reading of the report on TRT, the public was involved in a psychological disorder, saying, "I took everything into account by thinking that my friends were the city of fire. "
They wanted me to put a gun on my head and stop the explosions.
I just shut down the local TV.
Then I made them leave the building, telling them we had to go to the antennas.
I spent up to 20 minutes in a section where the antennas were found.
He said, "I've cut some more cables here, but I didn't touch the lights."
The trainers brought their TV operators to the Samanyolu TV before they could stop spreading in Turkey.
These terrorists were arrested by police three minutes ago.
When the trainers returned to the building about one hour later, they realized that they had continued their TV broadcasts on the phone, and that they had come to Akkaya, who had just died, told them that they were alive:
That night, I turned your nose off at 8:00 a.m.
That's where we got it.
One of my friends was a negotiator for the e-government and electricity system.
We met to drink tea at 9:00 a.m., and we had helicopters flying over us.
There were a few more soundless aircraft around the helicopter.
We saw their lights.
They were probably human-powered aircraft.
They were flying in front of helicopters.
11 years old, my team, I've been calling for the first time because I've seen a plane so close.
There's a movement behind it.
When we looked at the news, we learned that the bridge was closed.
Our general boss at that stage gave advice to friends who were not in the situation at the time.
When we went to the station to get information, we learned that all the releases in the TRT had fallen.
The TRT releases were cancelled in five minutes.
I called the TRT's mom's house, but I couldn't get it.
Our control station said the TRT releases came back and began to read the information.
Our Assistant Director, Halil Adults, asked the General Director for the release of TRT publications.
We started working to heal the spread because we made a wide range of TRT 3 channels.
We've heard that the President's Biennial Year's has a "dangerous" thing.
Our teacher's command to stop TRT has been put in a little bit of a psychology.
We cut the TRT, and then we heard the helicopter sound.
We went out, and the helicopter went to the station, and the helicopter burned all over the place, and they were all split apart.
We're hiding a building behind the back.
We were 12 people.
After we left the helicopter, the soldiers entered.
A few of our friends have been captured by soldiers.
And we went out among them, so that they might not leave them alone.
I saw them catch up with our general manager at the scene, and they broke down.
The soldiers were talking to each other.
One said, "I'll shoot one of them and you'll be scared."
Then they all sat in.
The commanders started shouting, "Who's responsible for this? I won't ask again."
And when we heard the kind of talk, "Let's hit it," we thought, "We don't know about the country, but there's an excuse for us to stop the TRT."
So there's a resurrection.
I felt like I was leaving my own life right now.
I said, "me."
I stood up and I didn't know what to do.
That's the only thing I've ever thought about, that my friends in the helicopter were fired.
I thought 10-15 friends were a city, and I thought they'd kill us at last.
He said, "You're going to stop all the broadcasts except TRT."
We have a system that monitors the local channels.
We're going out of the room with 80 of 200 local channels.
My mind is here.
There was no national explosion between them.
If I cut these off and say they're all gone, at least they'll get help from outside until then.
Or I said he'd go as far as he went.
We thought we couldn't get out of there anyway.
I said, "I'll stop it."
I cut out one of the local channel packages.
I've cut off the power button on the monitors we can monitor.
So there was no signal on all screens.
I told you I'd have to go to the antennas so she could be completely cut off.
The commander sent me to the memory with two soldiers.
I opened her room, and a soldier said, "Stand by."
It was based on taking my gun.
He said, "You're gonna stop everything except TRT, you're not gonna be there, I'm gonna shoot one of you at last, that's you."
And now that I'm gone, I said, "You'll see when you're gone," I didn't say anything else.
We went to the station, and I got the local broadcasts.
We've been through the other one.
At the time, I'm creating a system that's coming up with 20 national channels.
Nearly 20 monitors have gone off the ground.
So my Lord helped us, and we were not wronged in the least, and He united their arguments.
They believed in the answers we gave them.
They didn't.
It comforted us.
After they left, they asked where the trailer was.
I said, "I don't know, I'm a TV player," and he asked, "Is there an electrician between you?"
I said, "There's no electricity after tonight's table, if it's wrong, the team's coming."
Actually, there was an electrician at the time.
I thought I didn't break the ribs.
I thought I'd cut them off to wake up the soldiers.
They're a little relieved to think they're out of control.
They couldn't understand looking at the stars.
Now the group's ready to wait.
About an hour later, they opened the TV in the waiting room, and they saw the A News release.
He's in the army.
"My commander didn't break the A News," he said.
We looked at the command.
He said, "Stand up."
I'm tired.
Then a soldier said, 'There are still lights going on.'
He said, "There are channels that spread in the South."
And I said, "They are spreading over the Qur'an, so we cannot do anything to them."
He said, “After he had spoken to one of them, he took us all aside, so walk.”
The crew fled from Turkey with minibus.
I've seen pictures of the soldier who took me to the bathroom and gave me water.
Three times they shot him and shot him in front of him and behind him.
My friends claimed that he was the same soldier.
With us, they used to say, "Evlat."
He's probably a bad guy who's making his army.
They may have made excuses to get rid of him.
According to Akkaya's statement, the first police force came to Turkey from the governor.
When the police found out that there were helicopters around, the security officers were trying to find out, they went back and took care of it.
They're back in 40 minutes.
When the police came, no one was seen in the foreign mission in Turkey.
Only three to four minutes after the police were sent from the Samanyolu TV, they said, "Akkaya, they called the police teams, they said, "We're Turkish personnel, we need to get in."
He said, "The police were on their four-person phone calls, and they said, 'We're in.'

He saw a bomb in Ergenekon, killed FETÖ
Ankara President of the Republic, "Initiated" in 2009 is investigating the role of FETÖ, the Special Acting President of the Health Oktay, who closed the file in 2009.
In the same room with Oktay and six days before his death, the former Secretary of State, Ramasan Akyörek, who heard the false name of the Hizbullah Terrorist suspect, was questioned.
In the case of Ergenekon investigation, some of the concerns that have been raised are alleged to have been stolen and buried by the FETÖ security team from the Special Emergency Authority, and it is claimed that Oktay was killed because of his arrest.
Ankara, which was found to be shot on Saturday 25th, 2009, was called "intimate" to the death of Special Actor Behecht Oktay.
But there was a lot of questions in the case.
Two years after the legal struggle between his family and his family lawyers and the evidence he put in between, this time the murder investigation was opened.
The left-handed Oktay was in his right-hand hand when he said he shot himself.
It was also found in the guinea pigs and in the flesh.
The murder investigation case was opened in May 2012.
Only in the murder case, he was convicted of the Halil Kessic, who was present at the time of his death.
It's done by the end of the trial.
Nurhan Önder, who was sent to another criminal prison and sent a letter of arrest, told him that Octay had committed suicide, was sentenced to six months in prison for the crime of "swearing up and making false oaths".
AS TOLD BY SAVECILAR SORUSTRURULS
Meanwhile, when Hüsein Yuljjun, who called it "intihar", approached the Mustafa District Court, conducting his murder investigation.
The Octai family wants the bus driver to be questioned along with these drivers.
Behecht's sister, Saul Oktay, and his brother Nezih Oktay, found a lot of lawyers during the trial.
The family that told Halil Kesici that it was not possible to kill Oktay alone would want to expand the investigation.
The family, who said the case was under way, asked the judges to identify and condemn security officials who wanted to close the file with Hüsejn and Mustafa.
When all the demands of the family were rejected, Okty came out of the midst of a false name called "Abdurrahman True" to be a member of the Hizbullah Terror Council six days before his death.
And I'm told that I'm the head of the Department of Public Health, Ramashan, is an expert.
This development was initiated by the Ankara Community President, who re-entered the Behecht Oktay file, which was launched by the Constituent Terrorist Party (FETÖ) for the murder.
The case at the Ankara Criminal Court on the hearing of Oktay's illegal hearing will begin on 19 July.

Then he showed me the FETÖ.

For the last few years, Turkey, who fought in an unwarranted fight to end the PKK, began to face the day when its leaders could not destroy them.

BY AWAKE! WRITER IN HAIN
15 During the time of the entrance to the workshop, President Tayyyi and the President of the House of Erdoğan, FETÖ, led the printing and the sugar operation in Marmaris, led by General Gökhan Şahin Sönmmetesh, came to the conclusion that the sicilion of the Sicilian was a relatively strong force.
Previously, it was reported that Sönmmetesh had informed the terrorists of his flight to the PKK.
The research carried out by the U.S. agencies also revealed that the Sicilian Sönmmetash is a syllable.
PORTRAITS FROM THE PAST
As soon as the PKK was forced to surrender, the targets identified by Turkish warplanes were not fully met.
It was announced that the attack on targets was carried out by the heavenly Sünnembetish, at the point of the PKK's leadership cadre.
As the coordinates changed, PKK's warplanes were identified to attack the leader's radar, which hit the places on the side of the targets, and the terrorist leaders were thus rescued.
In the context of the investigation, the creation of targets, and the escape of PKK terrorists, without the interference of F-16, came into the middle of the Sönmmetesh's key role.
Opening 37,000 subsidized files

This will be done especially in the cadres, which reach the bottom of the cliffs.
There's gonna be a thorough investigation before the funeral.
The only 37 thousand copies of the file has been opened.
The FETÖ men will be brought out of the mind of the soldiers with a stone-crazed work.
And those who don't have a relationship with FETÖ will continue their duties.
When it is determined that the FETÖ will continue the struggle until the end of the year, the description of the pigs will come to the day after the investigation.
The investigation is carried out jointly by the MIT, the Security Authority and the State Audit Office.
Whether the files opened by the file are civilized or not, the files they received are searched for, the addresses they received, the locations they were assigned, and the commandant is searched for.
They will also be questioned by a staff member who has not been a member of the FETÖ.

Tugya Ergin (19) and Alathash (19) lost their lives.
It's the treatment of 3 people.
The police arrested five people who had been arrested by drug dealers at the festival.
After the security operations, 3 suspects were arrested, and 2 were released for arrest.
Young people continue to investigate why they die.
Two of the six young men who were camping and using drugs were injured on the shore of Burhani's village.
B.D. and G.C. died in the hospital.
The other four young people were taken to the security administration to take the statements after their treatment.
A bomb was blown in front of his wife's house.
The 41-year-old M.Y., in Brussels, revealed that he did his own work in front of his wife, who had left home for about 8-9 months with a severe disability, and had been working hard on it, filling his hands with sand, filling his hands with sand.
Because of the explosions at night hours, the mobs were afraid and panicked, so many of the houses were destroyed by the fires and the fires of the halls.
After the terrorist attacks, he started working to catch M.Y, who fled and was unemployed.
The residents of Mahalalel indicated that the woman had left the house for the sake of her wife’s prints about a month earlier and had settled in the house of refuge.
Explosion in the Philippines: 10 dead
The Cezaevi Administration and Penoloji Office's chief prosecutor, Xavier Solda, said that two Chinese attorneys lost 10 lives in a explosion that had not yet been identified in the Paranaque Prison in Manila.
Soda, who said that a garden was severely damaged in the palace, said, "We have proven that there is a explosion inside the first burned in the furnace."
He said, "The research on the reason for the defeat continues."
Before the incident, when the judges learned that they were going to be sent to another building, they indicated that the reports of the case had been filed with the guard, soda said that it was not part of the investigation that the suspects were not part of a escape entry.
The security officer, Jose Carumba, also explained that he had fired the guard's voice after hearing the gun, and that a hand bomb was fired around him.
He recorded how the prisoners were interrogated by Kurumba, the lawyers, the guards, and the prisoners who had shot the guard.
Explosions in Thailand
Three people lost their lives in the explosions on the 4th floor of Thailand.
The authorities, Trang, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket said three people died in explosions, 35 of whom were injured by tourists.
The police spokesman Pyapan Phingmuang explained that the bombings were not related to terrorism at his press conference.
Phingmuang, "There's no regional or religious problem with anyone in Thailand."
He used the expression "we think it's an act of inner sabota."
In his statement to the journalists, the county leader said he didn't want to make a point about who was behind the explosions.
Osaka said, "We must focus on ensuring security, order and trust."
In August 17 last year, the president of Bangkok's commercial center was killed by a bombed attack near the Eravan Camp in Rajprasong, which killed 20 people and injured 120 people.
"Sustained evil" will be inserted with the magic bell
Lonnie David Franklin was sentenced to death at least 10 years in the U.S.
Franklin, an old cleaning worker, chose his wife and drug addicts in his murders.
My cousin Kathleen Kennedy, who was accusing Franklin, said, "I haven't seen him commit a crime like you and so many crimes in my life."
Franklin is one of the bloodiest killers in California's history.
It was learned that 10 people were killed in prison and that a person would be executed by Franklin, who had been sentenced to death by the judge.
Progress towards FETÖ" in Macedonia
Macedonian President Furkan Čako indicated his steps towards the legalization of the extension of the FETÖ countries and the initiation of the necessary investigations.
"All of this is well known in Macedonia, as well as in the media and in the business world."
The Turks here don't give their kids to the FETÖ schools anymore.
And we're calling our people here so they don't send their kids here anymore.
He used to say, "This building, which has been blessed by the people's hospitality and prosperity, is well-known by the people."
The sky will be turned into the water of the meteor.
The University of Astronomy and Space Sciences Study Member Dr. Hasan Esenoglu said that Perseid will reach the highest level on the day of August 13th, in his statement to the AA president.
The Esenoğlu, which has been known as the "Swift-Tuttle" star of the thousands of parts of the solar system and the impact of the explosion, has brought the situation to a natural point of view.
In fact, Perseid said that the first discovery of the sky was in 1862 and that it began to be seen in the world since the 1990s.
"We need to look at such a glorious glory that comes from far away, and we need to be concerned."
As a result, it's a natural visual style.
He said, "He's going to get to know the universe better."
They'll light the red when they're cold, when they're warm.
In view of the fact that some of the particles that flowed through the water will fall to the earth in a great measure, he continued:
The perseid leaves can go up to two thousand centigrams.
In the atmosphere, the Persoids produce red and white light in the natural environment.
It can be found in the field of science by writing about how many heavenly bodies have been seen on the Internet from the Organization of the Universe.
This data is worth knowing that the world has been collected from everywhere.
He'll be able to watch all night.
Esenoglu, who remembered that the sky is moving at about 60 miles [60 km] in the second direction, wanted to be well monitored all night by this invisible forest in the north of the sky.
Esenogul, who discovered that over 100th of the year the ocean was at the edge of the ocean, wrote that after the Persian ocean, it was a natural phenomenon to monitor the surface of the sky in the mid 4-17s.
Little educated, old footballer Erdoğan
In the event of the destruction of this region, a small educated former footballer, Recep Taiyyip Erdoğan, who promoted popular Islamist participation in a large-scale religious movement, was the winner of more than one of the highly educated followers of the University of Tashkent from Tashkent, Texas.
A translation of the above in a series of articles that we spent the week in Foreign Policy.
Erdoğan, a small student and former football player at the university, is often placed in the capital of the West, where Gülen, who is the first, is known as a wide-ranging participant.
And then they're trying to explain in the other place why America and/or the West are rising up against Turkey? In the topic articles, they're trying to explain with words starting with, "Because Erdoğan...".
It is possible to think that the Westernness of Turkey is aware of Turkey's history by the analysts who saw it as a state of consciousness in the region of Erdoğan.
In fact, when it comes to statistics, Erdoğan can be read as one of the first ten years of the Erdoğan era, which was lost or left in the Middle East in Turkey.
For the past ten years, Zira has had good relations with the European Union and the United States and with the United States of America.
As for the 'one-minute Israel' of Erdoğan', for the 'one-minute Israel' of Erdoğan to Israel 'on-one-minute Israel' Israel 'and for Israel 'one-minute ' Israel ', for Israel 'on one-minute Israel' in Syria, for the defeat of the Esad of the Esad in Syria in Syria in Syria, for the failure to succeed in the military in the end of the war of war in the war of war in Esad, for the failure to succeed in the war of war in the war of war in the army of Syria, for the United Kingdom of Israel' for the United Kingdom of Jordan to be brought into Turkey by the United Nations President of the European Parliament of the European Parliament of the European Parliament of the European Parliament of the European Parliament of the European Parliaments President of the European Parliament of the European Parliament of the European Parliament of the Kingdom of the European Parliaments of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the               Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom                                                                                                                                 the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom of the Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom Kingdom of the Kingdom of a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a                                                                         is
Let's say that when we lose 247 people in the blood, we forget that we have no support for our democracy until the United States and the U.S. government are able to prove the failure of the U.S. government, and that Kerry is expected to build a 'Turkey' in the first interlocutory speech.
Well, how will it be forgotten that many leaders from the world, including the 11th Charlie Hebdo, in Paris, were involved in protest marches, but despite the fact that 247 people who had been killed for democracy had been killed in Turkey for a month?
What do we say that the presidents, or top-level representatives, who come a few times a year for the ruling issue, send under-representatives?
How do we evaluate whether all U.S. and U.S. growers have been visited by the government's newspapers that they have broken down, and whether they are not in a conflict visit to Turkey, which is bombed by the Great National Council?
In the first two weeks of work in Egypt, if it is recalled that the U.S. senior representative sent his hand to Sissi to work, that Kerry 'rebuilding democracy' in the post-laboration visit 'restructuring democracy', would it not be unusual for Turkey to find the same language in Turkey, which the countries of the United States, who refused to support in the wake of democracy, were unable to support in any case to support Turkey?
Even now, the people of Turkey are allowed to live freely in the U.S. Sun, which has been considered responsible for 95 percent of the population.
And if the plan I'm looking at is added to it, I think it's obvious that the rising West/American opposition is a situation that cannot be explained only by Erdoğan.
I mean, Erdoğan, he didn't even say that he thought he was a U.S. influence at work...
So we thought it wasn't a flight.
Can those who see their own people, who say, "It's a flood," and who don't think of themselves, be able to run from the same tongue as those who run the same way as the "Churchs" that run after the night of December 15th?
When they saw how this people got into politics and democracy, did they finally answer the question, "Where are we wrong?"
But so many questions need to be answered?
The Soviets who have been responsible for various camps to the Earth and have been given the right to use the government's weapons, have been forced to enter the Hain state once and have sought protection from foreign states.
We need to see how we live in the midst of a mental disorder and how the attitudes of apostates lead people to conduct that will lead to injustice.
When you come to Darbe's entrance...
Did Turkey have an opening to compare Turkey's borders to Syria's?
Why does a uncle bomb his own country's parliament?
We shouldn't have fallen into a mistake like waiting for smart behaviors to come up with FETÖ's bugs.
Other matters, but we know that everything is not just a FETK.
They have also done political wars, killings and hatreds, and have made necessary measures for the victims of the tragedy.
And they say not of their own selves what is apparent to them, but they believe that every kind of conduct is wrong and that there is no right for them.
And when those who hated their people were given the sword, We found them exposed to the fire.
The way of democracy, the way we know
I'm saying it's very simple: on the night of the 15th of November, the people's FETÖ army in Turkey gave 250 cities, villages, hospitals, and a lot of people's lives to save democracy.
But in the back of December 15, 1992-2002; 2002-2012; and after 2012, there are three times.
There are three changes that have been made in these three times: economic, social, political.
Social change has been in preparation for two major events: the transfer of metropolis from the cross-country area and the transfer of these movements to the centre after a very long period of time.
On Wednesday, I mentioned that this transport was by metro.
I also suggested that not being passed by the Metro is the most important social change factor.
And the second big change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
It's easier to understand the wood that leads to modernization of the road and the bridge.
It's coming, it's changing economic and social structure.
And we've changed the political structure.
I've seen this history in Istanbul with the bridge over the Boghaz since I was there.
Demirel, he made the Big Bang.
This was the birthplace of the post-50 village movement in the 1960s.
First of all, it's the second bridge we've turned into the 15th Wall Streets.
Even these paths show the relationship between the environment and the environment.
It's a sign of how you've been watching a social change route.
Demirel and Ozal's plan was to get big tickets to the city.
I'm going to give them a central ideology.
The AK Party hasn't done the third bull for years.
Because the move was running all the way.
The people who came were placed on the shores of the plain.
There was a kind of secret system created in those regions.
The AK Party's local government has given people a job, social status, and they're playing the AK Party.
So he didn't want to be in the center, he wanted to do political sciences around, and he wanted them to come to the center after that as 'the rest'.
This event was related to ongoing competitions in front of the AK Party (1992-2002).
These negotiations have admitted the importance of standing by the media, not by the media, but by the media and by those who are away from the community.
The AK Party has politicalized the movements I have described after 2002, politically divided, and increased.
After that, take care now, it's the same time for democratic conflicts in 15th of December.
So history and sociology have been corrupted.
I'll add another size: AK Party's collection is not only limited to Istanbul Bridges.
It's more interesting: The AK Party now completes the borders of the surrounding borders with central borders.
It's delivered by two bridges.
One, Osmangani.
Two, a 1915 bridge with the Chanakka.
Add paths to this.
Turkey's gonna get back from Trakya to Izmir now.
Do you know what that means, and after that, Izmir's gonna be in the bathroom again.
Let's say the AK Party's gonna get Izmir out of here no more.
Now, Bursa, now in Chanakakal, is going to turn the cities of Trakya into other countries and social backgrounds.
That's it!
15 Our cities are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie's and crazy music in Fenerbahce
Fenerbache, Grashoppers, was in charge of the morning training of the artist.
The training started at 10 a.m. at the technical director Vitor Pereira at Can Bartu Tessieri, a total of 1 to 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of Korean training in the salon, the players, the racers, and the swimming movements made 2 rounds and follow-up work.
Antrenman was filled with a couple of pieces that were made on the wall.
Fenerbach will take care of your preparations with the trainer he's going to do tonight.
That guy who complained about the Big Bang to the Sun...
There are new developments in the Czech Operation, which is managed by Fenerbach.
A program published in CNN Turkey and explained that this operation was carried out by FETÖ, journalist Hüseyin Gülerce, "The name of a sports world has grown up to Fethullah Gülen about his own life."
He said, "One day at the airport, this person said, "What are you doing with your Fethullah Gülen?"
And when this person transferred these words to the Sun, Fatullah Sun went to the Blue Star.
Why did he go to the Aziz Star?
The head of Turkey's most-favoured club can harm itself if it's in this science.
He used the expression "the case was to celebrate the Golden Age."
An explanation followed that came from Faik Light, one of the most important lawyers in the Czech Republic.
He went out to the meet programme published in the Light News and explained the person who complained about FETÖ's president, Fatullah Gülen.
Here's the words of the Great Light:
I'm sorry, I'm just saying something about Fethullah Sun.
When he comes from Azerbaijan, he's on a special plane.
He's a very handsome man, and he's talking with the squeaky words when he's making someone up.
Those squawks may be a bit of a mess.
He can show some of those words again.
These complexes are growing somewhere.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's not a matter of going to them as much as Hac, as he went to Umre, that's not how he's supposed to be accepted.
What they say makes it so hard.
Of course it's not the only problem.
Meanwhile, they're not testing a football team.
The connections of some footballers and managers from the Galatasary Club and Hakan Thank you...
Muharrem Usta: Chiche case is different
Trabzonspor, President Muharrem Usta, extended his friendship to Fenerbach.
Usta, who wants Turkey to be the issue of all clubs, says, "We're by this country with 79 million."
We've got to get a good job.
If there's a problem with FETÖ, if there's injustice, I'm standing behind Fenerbach.
"But there's a difference between Trabzonsport and Fenerbache."
Sacrifices were opened
Carbulut said, "We've jointly identified the price of a living animal as 18 litres."
He said, "We've identified the price of the beer and the price of the wine we've prepared for the second grade of 17 pounds, and the price of the wine as 15 pounds."
Carbult, who noticed that animals that were not to be sacrificed last year, also said that they needed to take care of their victims when they were sacrificed:
In particular, animals need to pay attention to their earphones.
Also important is that the animal is healthy.
That's why they can control our relatives' passports when they get their victims.
The victim must have been alive and alive with the outward appearance.
And it doesn't have to be defined as salt on her face.
We have seen that animals that have not been sacrificed in recent years have been burned and sold.
A sacrificed animal must be two years old.
We can understand this by looking at the animal's teeth.
It's a two-year-old animal's teeth that we've made up as a cat.
But the animals that were younger than the animals did not have those teeth.
The animals can be seen as big, but they may not have cut their teeth.
And the teeth are immediately identified because they're already grown by others.
The Rize Air Force will be made into the sea
The second airport to be built by the seabed in Turkey will be the Rize Airport.
The Rize Sea will be built on the seabed of 26 to 32 metres from the riverbed between the Bashar Valley and the village of Yeşilköy.
Because of the increased depth of the rice pipeline in the construction of the river, nearly three times the volume volume of its cargo will be used in the Ordu - Giresun Airport.
The project will be built with a pist at 45 metres per hour and three thousand feet per hour.
It is expected that the Rize Havalman, who will serve the passengers and cargo aircraft, will also be responsible for the composition class D, which is difficult to complete, and is expected to serve more than 150 000 kilograms.
The first phase of the project of the Rize Railway project, which will be launched by the General Administration of the Transport Marine and Communications Area, will be carried out by the Department of Public Investments for the first time in the 8-month period of the project of the Rize Railway, pist, aprinciple, cabsir, circuit, security telesport, miner, PAT ports and surrounding lighting.
These things are going to be 600 million lira.
It's going to be overworked with 150 million lira after the Altay's work.
It'll be completed in two years and nine months.
Motor Difficulties - switch devices
I've had eight rounds to spend on the engine's litres this night, so it's about half past midnight.
According to the information received from the Petroleum Landers Syndices (PUIS), the average 8 rounds price will be increased in the engine litres since 13 August 2016.
So in Ankara, the price of an engine with an average litre of 3.68 litres will rise to 3.76 litres.
The engine price in Istanbul will be 3.63 litres, 3.71 litres, and 3.66 litres will be 3.74 litres.
The prices, revenues and freedoms identified by the distribution companies may reflect minor changes to companies and banks.
I've had four rounds to pay for the engine's litres last Friday.
There's a Galatasara football game in Gülen's game.
In 1996, FETÖ, head of FETÖ, who was a Galatasarary and one of the thousands of footballers who shot the Turkish football club, took his place in the fight at Fettullah Gülen.
In a 1996 vision, Fetullah Tütneker and Joseph Teppekule are clearly identified among footballers who listen to Gülen’s speech.
He used the expression "4-dollar shots" when he spoke of Galatasaray.
Said Alpsoy, known as the former football team of FETÖ, was also known as Said Alpsoy in the past "Turkey was divided into the third world in 2002.
Emre, Okan, Hakan Thank you, Hakan General and Arif collected money from these sources.
The total amount was $250,000 or 500 billion.
He took this money to Pennsylvania for Arif Erdem.
He said, "After a while, the heavens were set up for Araf."
Thousands of footballers are involved in Gülen's fight!

Don't touch the social media propaganda!
According to the report, Isparta's Department of Human Rights has begun to work on information about the social media propaganda of FETÖ's campaign of entry from the heavenly Okçu social media and the efforts of President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan.
In the investigation, the team that identified the entry of FETÖ to work and the work force and to the work force of Mr Erdoğan were suspected of having done the operation.
Dr. Occupy, after his security operations, was arrested.
That year, he was taken to the police station and spent the rest of his life in prison.
After FETÖ's entry into work, he was taken to the police station by Häil Ibrahim and King's High Commissioner for Labour, who was removed from office by the Ministry of Labour after the FETÖ's entry into office.
The suspects were taken in security with the head of the morning.
Robert Amsterdam's very critical statements about FETÖ!
Robert Amsterdam&Partners, an expert in law investigating illegal activities in the countries of the FETÖ (FETÖ), has shared information on how FETÖ is organized by an article in the U.S. Department of Justice Robert Amsterdam, A.D. Forbes, published an article on the organization of FETÖ.
Fettullah, President of FETÖ, pointed out that Gülen's financial management of the capital of Pennsylvania, Amsterdam, indicated that Gülen's "as soon as almost 150 talks were to work in the U.S.A., it would be obvious that there was a hidden organizational capacity in the region."
Amsterdam said seven months ago that it had been commissioned by Turkey to investigate solar-related companies and schools, and it had been found to this day as a "speech" by the mother.
In his articles, Amsterdam took place at the following meetings:
According to the authors, they have a magic spell that the solar system is involved in.
These instructions are usually held at hundreds of meetings in Poconos with Sun and Sun.
There's a seven-person management group on the floor.
This group is transferring the instructions to the speech committee.
So far, scientists have gone to the churches of the country, to the churches of the country, to the churches of the country, to the churches of the year, to the churches of the province, to the parishes, to the houses of the students, and to the students.
He works at different levels according to the positions and support of the workers, the bureaucrats and the Soviets.
Astounded that 55,000 jobs were open throughout the world, Amsterdam, which claimed to have the largest speech school network in the United States, has been paid to these schools every year by U.S. officials.
Amsterdam wrote that a large part of the money was transferred to the "chosen" stock companies.
Amsterdam, this work has been described with the following examples:
The Magnolia schools established in California, which are connected to the Sun and shared the same office, have been purchased against the annual service contract for $700,000.
As another example, Amsterdam showed Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam reported that this school paid more than $3.1 million to the owner of the school, as well as that the authorities of the owned company had been found to be made up of the same persons associated with Gülen.
Amsterdam, which has the largest location in the solar network in 46 schools, noted that there are similar situations in Amsterdam, has paid money to smaller companies related to FETÖ, such as the conflict fund.

Dr. Giray, who explains why breast cancer is being seen in children, says, "It's an event that has been seen since I was three to four years old."
Most of the babies don't want to go through it.
The child who gives birth to his mother's needs to satisfy her needs will not be able to leave her mother's womb after 1 -1.5 years of age and take her finger to comfort her.
He said, "When the soul is pressed, and it wakes up, and sleeps, when it is turned away from its mother, it can be found in the conduct of the fingertips."
Dr. Bilgin Girray, who pointed out that the child’s lack of parental and child’s sense of self-reliance in the face of the perpetuation of the perpetuation of the permafrost in the years ahead, said:
Premeditation shows an effect in the shape of a child's teeth.
And the smoke that comes out in the midst of the mother-in-law is poured over her teeth, and the teeth that are under her are turned back.
This will also lead to the next location of the bottom line, to the bottom of the wall, and to the bottom of the teeth.
It's physiological, but it's a form of speech disorder, and it's an aesthetically negative.
Dr. Giray, who noticed that a much more complex treatment period could occur during the period of six to seven years when there was no previous solution, "We can prevent the closure and additional problems of our children from completing their development."
"That's why children need to be kept under control, such as eye and hearing controls in our day."

They don't need to use glasses in any way close to or far from our patients because Trifocal Lens also improves the interfaces.
Another advantage of Trifocal mercenaries is that they reduce their complaints at night.
Dr. Volkan Hürmeric, "The Trifocal Lens treatment used for the treatment of each community is not different from the normal short-term treatment."
Our patients we're using trifocal therapy can be relatively healthy with a 7-10-minute procedure.
And the next day our patients can return to normal lives.
It is a high quality of life for people who use their cars, who love to read, enjoy reading, and live a more active life.
You can also apply this process to any patient who is under the age of 18 to know that this process is not suitable for you.

This system is made up of the groups we call two big ones and two small ones.
In all four of these camps, there can be a lack of wealth and property.
The groups that are used in heart operations are large-scale groups that are large-scale groups of human beings.
There's no harm in the absence of these cells, and that's why they can be used in their heart surgery.
However, these cells must be healthy so that they can be used in the heart operation.
Because the heart is an important organ.
The work of the Varissile chambers is carried out by surgery or laser, the work of burning, and the work of the inner camps also reduces the work load and makes the legs more healthy.
A false belief among the people, and the heir, will be able to be used as a refuge.
It's never used in a variety of ways, and it's never used in their heart operations!
There are other needles that can be used in heart surgery.
In the heart operation, the cascade systems are used; under the head of the brain, it is located around the brain and in the neck.
It's not safe to wait and worry about it to use your inherited chest.

Self-expressed message from Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club President Stasun Stasun Tózbek published an explanation in front of the Super Cup Final to play between Galatasaray and the Galatasaray.
Here's what Stasun's say about the unity and harmony of the Turkish football club:
On Friday evening, August 13th, Konya's Grand City in Torku Arena will meet Super Cupa with Galatasaray, a two-eyed and two-eyed club.
This game is neither the first nor the last game of our club, but it's the first one on the record.
But as time goes by, it's a life-threatening encounter.
As all of us know, our country was hit by a big storm on the night of December 15th.
The Festulative Terrorism Model/Paral Government (FETÖ/PDY) which is committed to our democracy has been launched in the light of the accession of all members of the population and cooperation.
And We made that night a sign for the people.
We gave the cities.
We have plenty of gas.
This painful body reminded us once more of the state of democracy, and the need for war in these villages, not for the need to stop it.
That night, the Turkish sponsors of the sport also came out with one voice, one heart against work, and they always took a seat with the democracy.
In these critical days, we need more than ever to be able to identify the spores.
I want you to be the first champion of the new football season in the Turkish race, which will take the name of President Solomon Seba at the 2nd anniversary of the event, and our club's headmaster, Turga Sheren, who will take the name of the new football season.
Whatever the score at the end of May, the winner will be our country and Turkey's track.
Derbide 339. Saturday - Sport News

Rihanna populer in the film's frame
Hollywood's most important film series will be the ocean's successor to popular names.
In the new country of Serbia, the world-famous singer Rihanna, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, and Helena Bohnam Carter were also scheduled to take a place in the film, while Sandra Bullock and Kate Blanchett will be filmed in the days ahead.
Steps start in 2 months.
The film shows are scheduled to begin in New York in the month of the new month of the campaign by Ocean's Eleven's Women's Corps.
When Steven Sodenbergh, whom we know of before the film's show, will sit with Olivia Milch, the director of the film's workshop, and the director, Gary Ross.
He's flying down British under Scott Callum Skinner.
When the Great Britain team won the 2012 prize from London, the Scotch of Callum Skinner, in the Rio race, ran the race against men last night.
Glasgowlu, a 23-year-old contestant, was excommunicated by Sör Chris Hoy, a Scotsman, and was proud of this young, well-dressed New Zealander.
In the four years before Hoy's sixth Olympics took five, Britain had a shock.
And even though Hoy was a hero, they won this in the sixth season of World Championships organized in London in March.
Well, the problem between the game and London was that Jamie Stuff, an expert starter, was not changed.
They did this right when Hindus went out among them.
Hoy's jealousy also created an empty hole that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scott had already seen the potential he had already achieved, and the British coaches had not abandoned Skinner.
Four years ago, Hoy and H.D., together with the champion, had broken the Olympic record, although New Zealand had re-designed it for the first time.
And the British triangular, he went out for gold.
Hindus, although he was a little late in his career, he took care of Kenny's team, and Skinner stopped it.
This strategy has changed a large part of the transformation that allows Kenny and especially Skinner to slow down by using a much larger tool to slow down himself.
Hoy, the BBC's scientist was watching them from the spot, and when they came out of the podium, Skinner, Kenny and Hindus looked at them.
Glassowlu, 23, Skinner said, "This is an honorable comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and hear my name.
At the end, we broke the Olympic record and won the world's championships.
That wasn't really incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
In 2012, he admitted that he had fallen into a pistte prison after he won a battle with Kenny and Hoy in London.
Later, he took this approach, and there was no way to find a way out of Britain's records.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victim.
He said, "We were like London with all the Great Britain's beaches in Stanton."
We're just a team set up three months ago.
That's why we lost so much of the world's war, so it's really incredible that we won again in the Olympics.
It's just an activity for a country that won 10 conflicts in London.
If this is the amount of progress we've made in the last five months, he's waiting for us five more days to be successful in the race.
It turns out that Kenny's been my guest, and it's not impossible for Hoy to make a three-pound profit record in one of the Olympics.
This will mean Kenny's access to six gold medals and a silver medal for six gold medals and a gold medal at the same time on the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister.
This means the same level as Hoy.
Kenny, after that, he's gonna go out to the sprint competition; the competition will start today, and he'll be in three days.
Boltonlu, 28, said, "Now I'm just enjoying it.
Team activities are always the best.
You can win with your friends.
If it is to be true, it is only when a person has to be honest.
He said, "If you win two gold medals more, you'll have to give yourself a shot at the horse."
It's just that there's a lot of good news for Brittany, even if it's on this day.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owen Doul were the first to complete the round of four miles of the team.
They're done at 3:51.943.
The world record of the gold medal won in 2012 at 3:51.659.
First turn and final (22:42) today will be identified in the second section and will focus on all the concerns of Wiggins.
He lived in an inconsistencies with the officials when they called on him to measure the size of his staff.
In the activity of women to continue and complete tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milgavia reached the world record for Katie Archibald 4:13.260.
The Great British Empire is committed to the strong bicycle team to take over and win many medals during the middle of the Olympic Games.
After great success in London and beyond, the expectations in Rio were greatly reduced.
In the background plan, technical director Shane Sutton also experienced a number of bad developments that included the use of such important names as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton because of the sexual and violent crimes of Nisan.
But the first night after the fighting in the battle, it shows that the limit of Britain's endurance in the perfect time of the end can be reaffirmed this time.
Conscious of the future of Portland's steel lake with the ritual of the energy agreement
The work of hundreds of workers in the future of the Portuguese academia in Victoria has become unclear after one of the main owners has explained the hypocrisy of one of the talks of an energy company.
This move came to an end after the decision taken by the Government of Victoria to continue its work on the ground in the beginning of this year.
The 20-year syllable subjugation takes place in November.
Alcoa may be at a job risk until 2000 in Portland.
Any closure may be due to the fact that the task has been directly or fully taken into account by 2000.
And it's possible that we're going to have an I.D. effect because Victoria's entire power is about 10 percent high.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry closed his studies, and this opened the way for England's energy control to be shut down last year.
Alcoa's tax rate is losing money, and it's countering the risk of getting caught.
These developments have taken place in the beginning after several years of speculations that have been made to strengthen Australia's debt, and shortly before that.
AGL, which is located in Latrobe Vadisi, a large aluminium, said that it was expected that the other three parties would move in the process of completing their talks.
On the other hand, the vast majority of Alcoa and Aluminuma's participation in the CITIC and Japan's Marubine Corp companies are smaller.
"AGL is waiting for the Portland test to continue to work; this also means the physical electricity demand of the student will continue."
AGL stated that the agreements had to enter into effect since November 2016 as "risk settlement agreements".
They will be completed in 2017, since they are 12 months late.
The energy company said, "That is why AGL will continue to wait for the negotiations to be in stock for the financial year 2017."
The effect of AGL 2018 on the financial year and subsequent potential gains is limited by the fact that I have a strong public contract for the total electricity prices.
AGL indicated that the value of their statements in their accounts was now down to $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to conclude the negotiations "does not affect the ability of Alcoa to operate or maintain electricity in the classroom."
A U.S. company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, which was expected to enter into the contract this year in November, but did not explain why it was not terminated.
Analysts, both in Victoria and in Portland, have suggested that the economic pressures in the area of the Tomago test near Newcastle could be halted.
This week, the AGL's operational response to the analysts was Stephen Mikkels, Portland, about 600 megawatts each year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts.
In the case of both of these tests, the demand recorded in the [electric] market is going to be down there.
And this will not be a good development for us as a maker."
It's not just the year of Cardashian TV; Kendall, Vogue's Christmas Eve.
The fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Gener group of the mother and manager of Kristian Kendall Jenner (20) is at the end of the fourth week of the survey of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who was an emissary of the Estee Lauder brand, and who showed up in New York fashion weeks, heard this news from the Instagram account on Friday.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked at this hole in a room with my loved ones."
After the opening of the gate, the entire Cardassian-General family (who was in trouble with her, Rob and Caitlyn, and everyone's favorite shoe world, the mayor, Ryan Seacrest, made up of a stranger (and only Keeping Up with the Cardassians program), was released with a scenarioal reality video; the video also prepared a classic ending after the family forgot their sister's divorce: they were actually preparing a great party.
It's almost all of the children's television programs, even though it's a classic story line for every "birth day" series. (Second film show on September 8th, "Do you think we're forgetting you?") Kriss, other girls, should have included this identification in some way.
We must have entered a new Cardassian revolution with this development in Vogue's Ehill.
Kendall's brother Kim may have been past him about leaving Vogue's house ( his wife shared with Kanye West in Nisan 2014) but he was a success at the head of the Wall Street.
The number of Vogue's Christmas has been the biggest sales of the year.
In a fashion log, he drew attention to the fact that he remembered the book of many coffee tables (Fashionista, found the contents of the advertising book in 615 last year).
It's also a period that is closely monitored by the explanation of the star; the images of the star that we've seen in the past two years are being detached in front of the image.
Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss are among the women who have been placed in the camp before.
In recent years, there have been a lot of "model-made praise" in the hat.
Oscar's prized Dior's apostle Jennifer Lawrence was succeeded in 2013, and the following year, this honor was given to Lady Gaga.
But in the case of Mrs. Jenner's first category, known as the "scarlet model" of her offspring, it can be said that her environment is very good.
These are not young people today, because they're the neighbors of the famous people or the reality of the show stars or the good Snapchat video (all of them are Jenner).
All of this is women who are interested in the entertainment sector.
By the end of last year, Beyonce, who took his place, had spent one of the best times of his career with Lemonade's appearance.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
Because of the reality of the show, Jenner's fashion world will always be disturbing.
In the spring, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, gave them the name "the ruins of the site".
When the news of Jenner's coming out of Vogue's lock, that thought came back to the water.
But there seems to be nowhere to focus on unhappiness.
Kendall Jenner at Vogue's Hall.
A super model with the full meaning of his words.
He's getting himself into Marc Jacobs' missing.
He's taking you from the Estee Lauder fund.
He's selling his own pictures with his sisters, and he's selling his own pictures with his sister's payrolls about you.
Cindy Crawford, who took pictures, sells pictures of her daughter to the LOVE.
And in empty times, maybe it's just his brother Kurtney and his kids who take real places on the TV to see them.
The collective legal support centres are turning 160,000 people back every year.
The sector, while preparing to create more financial certainty in the currently underprivileged operations, has turned people from the most vulnerable countries to collective legal support centres over 160,000.
In Queensland, three of the five persons (mostly the elderly, the immigrants, the defenseless workers, the violent mobs, and those who do not fight against unfair decisions) are referred to free legal advice and representation.
The collective legal support services that have removed their assets are being prepared for more determination.
This legal support centre, which has been scheduled for the last year of the year, plans to leave more than 30 percent of the federal funding.
The General Court of the Districts of Queensland, Director James Farrel, General Court of the Districts of the United Nations, reported that thousands of people were found to have been returned each year.
Mr Farrell said that the federal government's decision would make a lot worse.
He said, "Queensland's collective legal support centres receive financial support in a chronicly inadequate way, and this means that thousands of people do not have access to services that are important to them,"
The people who struggle with the power, power, and power of the forces involved in the dispute, the family and the workers who have been out of work in the process... are facing all of these legal issues, and they are unable to get the help they need in this report.
The federal government, which will cut the funding from Haziran in 2017 at 30 hours, also means that thousands of Queensland's troops will have to be left without assistance from more complex legal issues.
We call on the Governor of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to get back these financial statements immediately so that people can receive the support they need when faced with a legal problem.
In the past, the government has made a promise to bring legal support to the international community.
Now we have to look at the efforts of the Palestinian Government to do this important work with the community and the communities they serve.
Donald Trump's campaign team was held after the person was shot.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team, North Carolina's operations director of surgery, was accused of being accused of any crime after being told that he had taken a gun to a person on the Sabbath.
Vaka, a former software teacher at the state campaign team on Wednesday, was brought to court by Vincent Boroni in the state court.
Brodoni said he's only expected to be concerned about the situation for months, but then he realized that "it's not going to be."
As he pointed out in Bordoni's complaint, Director Earl Philip "took a gun, put it on his right-handed finger, and put his finger on Vincent's finger."
According to the report, once the local and regional campaign team found out that at least four people were living the same test as Phillip.
"There's no need to fire the gun to destroy the weapons," he said in the Bordoni complaint.
Dava opened up to the majority of the President-in-Office of the Republic of North Carolina "the people of the Second Parent Change" (in a sense the owners of arms and their supporters) the election of Hilary Clinton and the election of his own agents two days later.
Trump's campaign team said that the media appreciated these words outside the bond and did not support their violence.
Bordini, with his complaint, wants to examine the campaign's team and the attack, the damage and damage caused by Phillip.
Trump's word, Hope Hicks, didn't change the message he wanted to make.
The efforts to get to Phillip were endless.
WCCB, a local news reporter in Charlotte, said Phillip had just left the campaign.
The call to Innovative Consulting Services, his speech company, was not turned back as quickly as possible.
The president of the community runs a campaign that makes Donald Trump the island.

The U.S. Secretary will be able to make this information available to the United States Security Council in the years and years to come, as they will appear on the "155 Police Imdad" line.
They were sent from Bodrum to Sivas as a 'examples village'
SIVAS' Gölova Lüccesi was a 'example village' with the cooperation of Kanköy, Kakamikamikamikam and the labour force of Sívas.
In the village where the roads were broken down and the streets were moved to the park, all houses were covered with blue and white colors, taking example of Mugula's Bodrum.
Gelova had developed a model village project to raise the image of the river linked to the river and the quality of life.
In this camp, 66 canküys are selected as an example village in the middle of the village, about 12 miles [12 km] away.
The streets of villages where the Alpine and upper services were expanded were decorated, and the removals were carried by the park.
The village houses have different colors, while the Pelit Pastanes have a job with the support of Salahttin Ayan.
The whole village is covered with white and blue-colored buildings.
BADRUM AIRNEK ALINDI
"The more modern appearance of the eye, the more familiar the whole house is with the color of all the houses."

We filled all the houses in Cankkoy, doing our work in white and blue.
This work has been done by the government and by the government.
The project has cost about 200 thousand lira.

The CHP member of the TBMM Plan and the British Commission referred to the CHP's records and concerns about the provision of the State Fund's law.com.tr.
They say, "When the foundation of this fund came to the Bütch Commission on the throne of the throne, it was important to offer that it be seen in detail in the original capital of the CHP's case, in order to be released from the roof."
And the government that accepted our view has redesigned the plan.
The plan came back to the commission today.
He said, "The government seems to be alarming about being expelled from Meclis within a week."
He says, "We're the biggest problem we're concerned about in the proposal of this law."
"The goods belonging to the people, the workers, the workers' limitations of the hardship to be taken from the workers, the income from the unemployment fund for the unemployed, the income to be recovered from the lack of privacy, and the fact that there is no problem with Meclis and the Office."
The Russian, China and the Körfez countries that set up these types of funds, they say, "But we have a plan."
That's why the phone's gonna be the money of the people from their sources.
The total of the unemployment fund is estimated to be 100 billion, 100 billion of the global unemployment fund for workers, 50 billion of which is still being transferred from the global unemployment fund, without any specialization.
He said, "This fund will be entirely the money of the people, even if it's in my test and it doesn't have to be used in any way."
Cacrator, who pointed out that the government's resources were collected and the government's funds were not accepted without the Meclis trial, explained the concerns and concerns of the State's law concerning the provision of the State's law:
The collection, cost, work and operations of such a large company are not transferred only to the testing of independent management companies.
I'm glad you've got your test, and you're gonna have to make a coffee.
There are no courts on the application of the law of the National Foundation for the Family of the Child and on the treatment and treatment of children.
There is no limit to how many sources are transferred.
No one's gonna ask about how this background is used.
It is necessary to finance large projects to the purpose of the fund.
There's no need to build an uncontrollable fund for this.
Why don't you take it in?
And then, naturally, the question is, "Why does it escape from the control of the Corps and the Meclis?"
They didn't oppose the transfer of money to investments when they were in the state fund, but they were opposed to non-scalable, unaccountable mechanisms, and they continued, "Can such a fund be dealt with?"
But if the government insists on this, we must ensure that the national standards that such funds are established in other countries are also valid in Turkey.
It must be configured in a way that the control and accountability mechanism is brought.
If there's no syllables on it, he'll have to set up his own account of his own money that he's used for the rest of his life.
"We are pleased to hear that we are hearing the reports at Meclis after the 15th of December, especially after the AKP's entry into work."
We also hope that the AKP will listen to our creative actions on this bill.
We're against the illegal use of thousands of objects, the circulation, the absence of responsibility for those who use them, and the lack of cultural control.
He said, "The Fountain of God can only be useful if these sources are gone."
The next law proposal has found that efforts have been made to ensure that AKP is extended between the college and AKP.
"The investments we've heard in Turkey are a demonstration of security."
In Istanbul, President Ali Koch, ford Automotive Management Office, speaking at a meeting, said, "I'll pay 30 billion TLs we've done in five years, a demonstration of the confidence we've heard about our country's coming."
The Director of the company’s numerous foreign affairs company Ali Koch, the Director of the Koç Holding Management Office, organized by the Istanbul Office (ISO), met with the "Trusters in Turkey, Manufacturers in Turkey" on behalf of Turkey.
Ali Koch, who spoke at the meeting, said, "Our faith and trust in our country, together with our partners, are not only words, but we are filling it with our resources and actions."
We've spent 30 billion TLs that we've done in the last five years, showing the confidence that we've heard about our country's coming.
It is not the property of Turkey to attract more foreign investment; it is a reliable and just legal system, a democracy, moral hardship, and an environment that promotes innovation, participation and sharing value in international standards.
In the last few years, our government has given us the most impressive developments in our society's history.
"I believe that he used a new expression "We'll be able to start the Extension Assembly" that we need with all of these incentives and strategies.
Siemens Sanai and Ticaret Turkey's Head of Management and CEO of Hüseyin Gelis, "We know this as not just one country anymore but as global players."
We came to Turkey with a long look.
As long as we are together and together, our problems will be solved.
We were able to move to these villages 160 years ago not to be in Turkey.
We'll continue to be in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course, we're going to build factories, but in this case, we have to be clear."
As soon as Turkey's first 10 countries are identified as one of the first 10 countries in Turkey, Prime Minister Ahmet Erdem said, "Turkey is one of the first 10 countries for Shell."
We sincerely believe Turkey's potential and future.
We spent a lot of time working on starting energy, and we're going to keep doing it.
We are grateful to our chairman, our president, and to our members of the United States for their support of international investors.
It's work that's been done to secure investors.
He said, "This is the way to increase our country's resilience."
According to Dr. Altan Demirdre, President of the Federal Republic of Turkey/Novartis, "in August 10, our Global CEO will come to Turkey."
But it was worth it.
And we've been against that.
Because CEO's coming was very important.
They've found a car that doesn't pass, like a protection.
Then when he came here, he saw everything was normal.
He left the guards and the car and returned to the country happily.
It's like marriage.
First of all, if everything goes well, you'll be married and you'll be married to a long-term plan.
We're married to Turkey, and we have no intention of divorce.
He's back from my flight!
The Prime Minister's Biliary Year, which was organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce at the Swiss Hotel, welcomed the people working with teleconference to attend the meeting on Turkey's "Trusters in Turkey, Manufacturers in Turkey".

15 In addition to the statement that Turkey's returned from a great disaster on the night of December, "those who are trying to destroy our country, those who are trying to destroy democracy, those who don't even fear the bombing of our Gaza Strip, if they were successful, we were talking to another Turkey today."
We're talking about Turkey between three world countries, one of which has been managed by Darbe, has been removed from the middle of the world, and the world's developing countries have fallen apart.
"Thanks to God, our nation's leadership, our leader, our vice president, and the leadership of Mr. Recep Tayyyy and Erdoğan and our government," he said.
The President of the Year said, "We will go out of the scene and look forward to it."
It's never true that we're living with a temporary job.
We have very similar goals ahead of us.
This job did not interfere with Turkey's economy.
The chaos and crisis waiters were wrong once more.
Today, our democracy is in the hands of our economy.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to work in a healthy way.
In 2015, the foreign market seemed to fall to 25 percent.
When the cari opened it in 2014 was 5.8, this was a 4.5-year-old situation in 2015.
We're about to drop to 4 at the end of this year.
We'll never change our common position in the capital.
Turkey's 2016 bet has been on more than 130 million countries.
We've been down to 1.3 percent in 2015 and we're urging you to protect these things.
We're better than the U.S. people, and we're better than many countries in the world.
Our banking financial sector is continuing to work in a healthy country.
"We didn't need to pay the price, despite our Bank 15 Temmuz, and we don't have a statement on our reserves, we have a double reserve of 121 billion dollars on our reserves."
I am the President-in-Office of the Council, who announced that the development of the economy, the increase in production and the creation of new areas of demand, will make it easier for us to do so, "We are also making considerable adjustments to save you from your responsibilities in the past."
We continue to make many adjustments to the extent that we have been able to re-assessed and reimburse our unpaid tax duties.
He said, “Go on building for the land, and build for your land a place of refuge, and your kingdom will continue to remove all obstacles from you.”

Mehmet Shishek: Turkey does not withdraw from the West, does not withdraw from the European Union
The Assistant Assistant Minister Mehmet Shimšek, Science and Technology Department of the Faruk, Economic and Social Council, organized by the ISO, has participated in a meeting of "Trusters in Turkey, Manufacturers in Turkey".
The Scientific and Technological Council at the meeting is private, "I think that there is a lot of good results from the progress that has taken place on the night of December 15 and later."
The most important of these is the unity and spirit that all of Turkey feels at this time.
The 15th century has shown Turkey's economy as well as its population as well as democracy.
"It is clear that the next period will be easier and faster for a population that has caught this level in the economy and democracy."
"LaziM OF THIS CUSTOMS OF THE SECURITY"
The 15-Temmuz report from Faruk Uzlü, who said they were forced to tell the world that they were forced to enter the world, said President Nihat Zeybek, that the government had made it a chance to do so.
And in the last few years of Zeybek, we have to concentrate on this job if my first five-faced sector's wife is going to go to 63.4.
Our Chief is coming back to tell him about this.
With the Real Sector, with the banking system, with the government, with politics, with 15 Temmuz civil democracy, and with the exception of Turkey, it needs to be rid of this burden.
In this regard, we welcome the developments in the last century.
"In the next half-month period, the Banks began with the encouragement of our Creator, nine-monthly, nine-point, and eight-year-old, which started down in support of the economic management, we will be able to realize that the Bank can continue."
"JEYL PASPORT, THE EMERGENCY OF THE EMERGENCY."
"We will not leave a country that has not been taken into the leadership of our Lord, and we will not be robbed."
We're not going to leave anyone we've contacted about increasing our cigarettes.
He said: "Never will we look at it, nor shall we see it with our eyes, nor shall we be of the birds that fly behind it."
In addition, Zeybekchi also used the term "one of the most recent decisions that has been made, and we have concluded that he should now be managed in the economy; and we will give the first of our numbers to the first 17,000 refugees, which represent the country, to our employer's command."
"DARBE GREENS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BULNANTS"
The President's Assistant Minister Mehmet Shimšek said, "The fact remains, we need to look forward to it."
For two simple reasons, Shishek, who says that he has been inspired by the OHAL, said, "Of course, those who are involved in this struggle need to be cleansed of the government of those who are in the workplace, and this process is working; but more importantly, reforms were needed to prevent this type of work from being opposed to them."
This is also a climate that is necessary for these major reforms, the Pacific has been launched, and so far many structural reforms have been made.
"As we do all of this, of course, we have moved within democratic priorities and the rule of law, we will continue to do so."
Shishek, who said that life has become normal in many areas, pointed out that it is not the least reason why companies and companies that have not agreed on the financing of the terrorism are lost.
"Bence Turkey's democracy, who wanted Turkey's democracy to improve, has healed the foundations of its democracy, because when you look at the roots of the recent problems, you will probably see that this propaganda network is in operation.
"The removal of this terrorist threat from the state by means of his request will strengthen Turkey's democracy."
Shishek, who says that the foundations of the economy are generally healthy and have never been lost again to normal structural reform days, says, "Turkey has become my real day, and there is progress in structural reforms."
We're not going to be able to make any reforms, because populism and security are growing in the world.
"Only Turkey and only reform can prepare for the future."
Finally, Shimšek, who pointed out that Turkey's not going to be part of the West, spoke in the form "It can be different with our time-consuming security, our friends, but it doesn't go from Turkey to the West, it doesn't leave the European Union."

Britain needs to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow's not only in our local communities and London, but also in the country, it's going to bring about renewal and rehabilitation.
I think it's going to bring Heathrow a very good idea, as we're doing in 2012 as we're trying to get all these countries and regions to benefit from the Games.
The Olympics, Stratford and East End had great adventures.
And we'll create opportunities for the people and companies near Heathrow and we'll be able to do it again.
We're just going to create 10,000 new jobs for our local communities, 40,000 jobs, and we won't leave young unemployed around the atmosphere.
As was in London before 2012, those who think that Heathrow's fighting is too hard.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and we would be ready for the whole world.
Those who heard the birds were wrong in 2012 and they'll see that they're wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to come from above, but Heathrow, who's answering all the questions asked.
Heathrow isn't just a few people, like heathrow is in the Olympics. It's a subroutine project for many people.
The expansion, 180.000 new jobs and 211 billion economic growth opportunities and the environment also leave much to be done in the United Kingdom.
In Heathrow, we have a great team to implement an investment of 11 billion dollars in time for the world's largest two-footed pedestals until T2 has been selected for five years (the best airstrip of the world).
Now we're ready to raise a third pist that is supported by private investment at $16 billion.
London 2012 Games was a great success for the United Kingdom, and there is no doubt that Heathrow's expansion will be the same.
It's time for us to secure the future of the trade, as Heathrow's spirit expands, and to create a lot of opportunities and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, Head of the Heathrow Board, and Secretary of State of the Old House
Adblock Plus, Facebook advertising game like "like a kedi-face"
It means "sympathy game" for companies that receive money from online advertisements for preventing advertising programs from entering software.
On Friday, a blog blog published that announced that Facebook advertising enthusiasts would be blocked on the desktop site only two days later, Adblock Plus said that users could update their filters to prevent social networking ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook, it said that it would change the codes around the advertising area to make it difficult to identify which part of the advertising page is advertising.
But Adblock says now he's solving new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock's dictionary Ben Williams wrote, "These progress has been made since the release of a protest has been made between the public and the crowd of people who are trying to prevent it" and Facebook may have developed its own solution in the near future.
The involvement of the world's largest social media company in this struggle shows how much concern the media have for the sector.
According to Pagefair and Adobe's work last year, nearly 200 million people worldwide are using advertising software, four times the number of people who used this kind of software in 2013.
Facebook now generates 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue with 1,03 billion mobile users accessing mobile devices.
According to one dictionary, mobile advertising enthusiasts are following Facebook’s mobile applications for social networks and the lack of effect on Instagram’s advertising on the company’s desktop.
Facebook must be able to make the desktop advertisements available enough, since it is worth it to cover this kind of puzzle.
On Tuesday, Facebook explained that people will update the "advertising preferences" tool to better control the advertising that is stored to them.
On Friday, Facebook said Adblock was concerned about new filters, and without the advertising on the site, he said he'd shut down some of them.
A Facebook dictionary, an e-mail client, said, "I don't give these people a good try and we plan to deal with this problem."
We are focused on creating tools, such as the Advertising Preferences, to give control to people.
A woman traveling into Switzerland's car, it looks like an accident.
The victim was sleeping in a car half-night.
The police are looking for people who witnessed a couple of cars crashing in a car on Friday morning.
The case came at A1 near Morges in the Vaud Canton of Persebbe.
The Vaud police said in one of his brains that his wife was sleeping in the dark of the night "in a slow way" and that he was hit by several vehicles.
Several tools were used to involve a Swedish woman, 49, who apparently wanted to kill herself.
He lost his life in the event.
The police said that they were met by a couple of drivers who were involved, but that some of them could not be identified, and they wanted everyone involved to apply to them and to them.
The lawyer Gilles Hofstetter, Le Tribine and Geneve, explained that "a "problem" penalty has been opened to the "progressive" action to be taken in such situations."
But it's not yet known that the driver involved will not face any crime.
Was it possible to avoid a confrontation?
That's what the lawyer needs to find," said Hofstetter.
It shows that the driver won't be held responsible for two likes in the last five years.
In the newspaper, both cases (both involving a person who was in the dark) were tried by the judge because he did not expect a traffic accident to occur in the middle of the night.
Last year, one night in August 2014, he found it innocent of a police officer calling a man who was lying near Payinner on his way to death because he was unaware of the cause of death.
The court said that the 22-year-old victim was drunk and down the street.
The court stated that a police officer who was in charge of an emergency appeal was used in an artificial manner and that a man was found on the road as "unless and unforeseeable."
Those who are aware of this incident near Morges on Friday, should call the police on the phone number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus adapted for a lifetime
According to NASA's new climate model, there was a time-consuming way of life in Venus.
NASA Goddard's Space Works Institute has developed a model for discovering Venus's history using tools and algorithms, such as the use of climate scientists.
The model, Venus, hot, waterless surface, and a full atmosphere with CO2, were designed to determine that he did not build a house with similar speeds on Earth.
It was about explaining to the people that Venus's low rate of conversion in the past with the atmosphere's roof.
But the newest ideas are to suggest that Venus may have an atmosphere like the Earth, and that it can return soon.
He also looked at the topography of old Venus.
Although there are more severe areas than the Earth, it may have been able to prevent rapid confrontation with sufficient water and moisture.
Old Venus, at the same time it was 30 hours longer than a light sun.
The GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio, in a news section, said: "The slow return of Venus to the GISS model made it possible for the sun to return to the sun almost every two months."
This also led to a watery deep that turned its face against the sun’s heat, which was like a well - watered region that protected its face from the heat of sunlight.
As a result, only a few more colder climate climates have been in the midst of global warming in our day.
Model made it possible for Venus to create a story like that of the evolution of planetary scientists who had previously been shown to be a hypothetical.
Even though Venus had suitable life-cycles, for a few billion years, it had become too much fat and ultraviolet light.
The oceans were frozen, and the water was out of balance with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen went down, and then it was only carbon dioxide that had the effect of deadly gas, and then it disappeared, which is why we know that today, Venus.
Researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Articles.
Patrick Roy used Avalanche's antelope
Patrick Roy used Colorado Avalanche's coaching and hockey operations on Friday, saying that the team did not have the right to make a decision.
The head assistant/general manager of Colorado, Joe Sakic, approved this development and indicated that the club will soon start calling a new coach.
Roy, in his 50s, said, "For the last three years, I've been in charge of my primary coaching and hockey operations in Colorado for energy, maintenance and determination."
I've been thinking for a long time about how I could improve and how I could get a higher degree by giving the depth that I needed.
To achieve this, the horse and the VP hockey operations must be in a constant sleep with the visual of the device.
He must also have the right to speak in decisions that affect his team's performance.
These steps have not yet been met.
He thanked Roy for his team members, Sakic, on May 23, 2013.
Sakik said, "Patrick informed me of my decision today."
He appreciates everything he does for our creation, and in the future we have a lot of luck.
Roy and Avalanche were seen as the best driver in the first season of 2013-14 as the best driver of Jack Adams Ödüllen.
The club won 112 pounds and led the team to its first finish, but Colorado was transferred to Minnesota on the first tour of the play-off cycle, and every two years after the season.
Avalanche made 39-39-4 targets in 2015-16 and received less than five dollars for the second gambling area in the Western Conference.
In the Honor List, Roy won four Stanley Cup for the Montreal Canadiens both for Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue to meet with the grevi army.
The North Sea oil workers were recruited for free of charge, and the main negotiators started negotiations for a new meeting.
Petrol district services are to be conducted in platforms in the North Sea, operated by the Grev Royal Dutch Shell against Wood Group.
A joint statement was "We decided to resume the process of resolving existing disputes as Union and RMT signals with Wood Group," he added.
In the weeks ahead, we're going to set up a series of meetings every day to open up a new look at the problems that we've had since the week before.
The labour unions have shown that this protest has been the first step towards 30 percent of the free ends of the world.
Wood Group, this year, we're on the market, has made a 9-percent cut in the payments made to the North Sea carriers for the reasons that we're on the market.
The company also applied for a payment of 10 per cent to its carriers in 2014 after the reduction period.
The company said it would provide the company with the area needed to get through the difficult times in the market.
Shell, when the English energy company adjusted its operations during its association with the BG Group, countless thousands of people were fired from work and reported their plans for oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices resulting from a decision to leave the European Union in Haziran, Britain.
The Swedish Parliament member Dave Anderson, meeting with the working leaders this week, will discuss one of the biggest job opportunities in the North Sea.
As he said, the North Sea is important to the regional economy.
"We need an active economy for the majority, not for the lack of the North Sea and the country," he said.
Although we've been spending about seven billion dollars in the last five years as a average, in 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea.
Peppers, he measured the rotation rate of the stars in the World team year
Kepler's space telescope, with the last result, helped scientists to create the most extraordinary directory of change in the world's seasons in the year.
New data helps scientists understand why the stars in the team's year are changing quickly and that they are able to understand the planet's orbits.
Luisa Rebull, research scientist at Caltech's Construction and Analysis Center, said in a news section, "We hope that a star's mass, age and even the history of the solar system will be able to learn more about the relationship between the past and the future."
The world team is 445 light years away from Earth.
Most of the stars in your team year have been created 125 million years ago and is reaching a new level of accessibility.
They're going back to the highest possible speed of life.
As soon as they turn back, the stars that are at the bottom of the scene are creating a vast array of stars.
These rays have an effect on the stars as they progress in the magnetic fields of the stars.
A star starts to fall as soon as it's grown.
Beplers, each star can be seen as the sun's rays, and they measure the distance between the star's appearance and the star's shadow.
The last turning point is to highlight that larger stars have become faster than smaller stars.
Rebull said that those who grew up like dancers made their turn easier than those who were smaller on their feet.
Rebull said, "We see the world's slower and faster, but the faster it gets."
The country team is looking at an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparison with star characteristics since the year is very near.
Rebull said, "The country team is providing theoretical models for the turning of stars, both young and old."
There's more we want to know about how the stars turn back, when and why they fall, how they're going to fall, why they're leaving 'dans' behind a hole.
Rebull and his colleagues explained in detail three new articles to be published in the Astronomy Report in a short period of their latest analysis of the turnouts of the World team.
