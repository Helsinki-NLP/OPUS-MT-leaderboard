Triomphe of right people in Austria, they have 29 percent total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria resulted in a significant decrease in the current large coalition, as well as a notable increase in the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffers from particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return on the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The OSP, which with 25.6 per cent loss of nearly nine per cent of votes, is still worse.
This is the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, who has deplored the anticipated elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In July, when the OSP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable progress on SPÖ.
Or, the electors are obviously punishing them for letting the government collapse.
Of the first responses to the results, speculations regarding the possible resignation of the leader of the party and current vice-president Wilhelm Mutterer were made.
The observers believe that this could occur from Monday at the special advice of the party's leadership.
Such a change would make it easier to take the course of the outcome of the election that remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the great SPÖ and OVP coalition.
However, in view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free-goers (FPÖ) would have received 18 per cent and 11 per cent of the votes - socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the populist party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still united, that in 2005 BZÖO was separated) on a common government, which even imposed sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to cooperate with any party and that he intended to return to Vienna on the national political scene, apparently on this evolution.
The last party to have access to Parliament is the Greens, but these have been slightly lost and dropped, among the Austrian political parties, from the third to the fifth.
Of course, no other party extends the limit of four per cent and does not access Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India are at risk of being frozen
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India was not resolved, the Czech Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, according to the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, would have found some extenuating of the Czech-Indigenous Relations.
The Minister said today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem had not been resolved, then yes, a certain chilling would have occurred," he said after the meeting, followed by a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, speaking out, that executive power could easily intervene in judicial cases.
However, in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed from the charge and fined, the central government was able to negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling, the case being settled under its jurisdiction.
"There's a problem that could be settled," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then request release under trial and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner would express himself in the same way during the talks.
"The advice to appeal to a higher court, after which he may be thanked," said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way that the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the defendants with "a competent legal support", said the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We want above all to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition that has continued for many years.
The Indians also recognize it," says Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic had given much importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great injustice," he said.
The Minister ignored the question of whether he had obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
"I've already received enough promises," he said alone.
A Chechque to Arbitrary the Battle for the Sea Background
It is close to an electronic wall map, on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are represented.
But he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the United Nations team of thirty members of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His head, the head of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, followed the presentation and the complete time.
The joy of work and enthusiasm characterize the refreshing atmosphere.
The bottom of the sea covers a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Petroleum, minerals and other mineral resources can be found, but also living organisms for the unknown, which can contain the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A much larger depth than the ground
Literary states have begun to hope for the new sub-sea areas with winters.
According to a United Nations Convention, they are in effect serving their rights, on which they were agreed in 1982 to Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially true of what is called the Continental Shelf, which is often hundreds of miles from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the Continental Shelf.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its subsoil is considered as a continental shelf, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the litral sea, often beyond the two hundred thousand marines that represent the country's exclusive economic unit," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned submit to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the Continental Shelf should be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on current cost-effective prospects and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific assistance.
To date, the Commission has received five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have known success," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to significantly expand its sub-marine assets, has recently been known as a global retention.
New Zealand has also received from the territory - the size of the seabed, which has been allocated to the Commission last week, representing 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the width of the country multiplied by six.
The two countries invested millions of dollars in prospects.
The benefits they will derive in the future of the exploitation of the seabed will, as they propose, be unappreciative.
Furtherly, other countries will, in turn, apply for them.
They can do so within ten years after ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
Here, when the continental Shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, proclaimed by the Convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no more state plays an exclusive position.
The right to extradition in this area is attributed to an international institution established by a convention.
"However, we don't miss it, the seabed is not a Klondike," said exaggerating Director Mikulka, stating that "these areas are clearly defined and their regime is still in a contract".
Tchéques in the Pacific
A part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other States of the former block of Eastern countries within the framework of the "Interoceanmetal" Joint Organisation.
This was achieved in 1991, under the Convention, as well as by investors from some other States, the status of what is called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and the Kiribati.
The area envisaged by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is moving there, it is a kind of sub-marine replication of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it from a wide area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Robert Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a conclusion.
It recalls a small dust of the earth, or well, with a little imagination, the mythical foam, which, according to legend, animaled the Golem.
German special forces were on the ground for the release of hostages
The Government of Egypt had requested Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they never went through the action.
More details on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists taken to Egypt are revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also directly participated in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal military specialists and GSG 9 staff of the federal police and the federal police office, as well as experts in the logistics of Technische Hilfwerk, were on the scene of liberation.
As well as the Ministry's spokesman communicated it last night, Germany's forces were not finally required, the prisoners had released their prisoners and had left when they recognized the need to release them by force.
The Government of Egypt would have accepted the help offered by Germany to integrate it into the support force.
"It's not very happy to be here," said a spokesman from the Federal Interior Ministry.
A group of five German, five Italians, a Romanian, and eight Egyptian accompanying tourists had been removed from the south of Egypt.
After their removal from the desert to the south of Egypt, the otags were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the arresters remains until now empty, as well as the details of the release or possible payment of ransom.
Those who have been saved are in a good time, except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the released hostages were under the protection of Germany's embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the moment, no information was provided on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", five vacationers and special forces should have landed on board an Airbus Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States Chamber rejects the rescue plan
The first room of the United States Congress has gradually forgotten the saving plan for financial markets of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was down in the open.
By 227 votes against 206, the United States Chamber rejected the rescue plan for government financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by the President of the United States by George W. Bush and the political men to the head of the two parties, the programme that had to overcome the chaos of the financial markets had not been achieved by the majority.
In a dramatic manual, participants had been desperate to convince the opponents of the well-founded plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called on Members to vote in favour even though the plan was imputable.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones dropped more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the State Rescue Plan could be understood.
It takes a little time before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of the vote, to lose again.
Experts are now planning a new major disturbance on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to be implemented, the approval and room of Members and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In the case of reservations for the next month, according to one study, the number of cases increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 per cent.
Despite the weak conjunctive perspectives, the taste of German travel remains unsatisfied according to this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a business figure of more than 31 per cent over the same period of the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencys (DRV) trusted in Berlin.
According to the Research Institute for the GfK Markets, the growing number of reservations already dominate the months of the autumn.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the DRAV.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the data on reservations from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since late August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the lack of the dollar, travel to the United States would be particularly requested, the DRW said.
There, the increase in reservations would take about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our opposition, would be destinations specifically sought by the Germans.
The organized travel is particularly demanding, explained the president of the DRAV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organised travel".
Consumers can save money from others with discounts or all inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been well maintained although an increase in sales figures will be reregistered over the last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Bière party
Ballermann or Apres-Ski's hits continue, of beer in letters and celebrities in Tyrolian costumes to design.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we didn't have a big shot in common.
She's a blonde, television animator and wears a Tyrolian style in measure.
I've got hair on my head, I'm a student, and my dress is an opportunity.
But one thing is related to us: at least three minutes at the festival of the church, and the photographers are already sitting on us and filling their memory card - very exciting, and this is my first visit to the festival of the church.
That's how we make friends.
Tyrolian good market practices seem to achieve their goal.
As a holiday tourist and normally living in the north of the Weißwurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional custom was so limited.
But once on the Thérèse place, it's half worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolian suit or leather pants; no one has a broken or damaged air - it's completely normal.
Only the table of my Tyrolian costume collects some strange eyes at the stand of bananas-choco.
A bavarous makes me realize that I would have been wrong to touch my table: "to the left I mean free, to the left, to the right, to the left, to the left."
Unfortunately, I tripped my ass from the back to the left.
"That's better," she told me, and it's cool.
Others do not give themselves so bad for these low-flight techniques and carry simple lights, on which it is written "Too drink to get dressed!" and expose us to their back-train without being invited.
The young man in the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time at the festival of beer.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a long-term "oooooo".
He tells me all this after being relieved of the shock he had suffered before.
Right next to this mouth of fire that the whole world thinks it's a powder.
So Bob's one of those "savior hunters" sadly famous.
Others have no chance of getting out of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the fishermen' fish are running on the party's place and they have to take care of poor farmers.
Instead, nurses intervene - always four times, they train their city covered with tents in tents.
This works for most of the guests of the festival: we're going to be empty, we're going back to full.
Those who sit in the circle of burres under the tree are not visible.
"These are those who can no longer appreciate anything," I was asked by one of the assistants who answered my question and then disappeared in the mine.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old pétonne, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carol Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in a Friday afternoon accident in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but then she died.
As a result of the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because of suspected of dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, in custody.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Even before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, European powers had a hard time putting pressure on its back.
On the other side is the Bosphore, 20 may not be, from Asia, one of the most final religions of his empire's ambition is broken down.
Hydarpasha was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is equipped with a horse at the bottom of the platforms, a tour of observation to each of its angles, such as some German provincial fairs.
The stones are salts.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the stolen ticket, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The race was launched in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medium-sized ambitions of domination through this path of action that reaches Damascus, Baghdad and the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialistic ambitions came to an end during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its region around it, generated by the smooth borders of the Froide War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire further advance Egypt and push the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha's car.
In 1917, a train loaded with explosive munitions destroying its subtile altogether.
Turkish sources say it's a sabotage.
Since then, it slowly falls into ruin, including in the ruins of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its region around it, generated by the smooth borders of the Froide War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I am aboard a truck-lit towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Suât Kinniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a 10- and-a half-hour journey, followed by the exciting railways that the cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital, presented as a new city of a new secular state, returning the two to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspects the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP's general district, a modern ultra-construction structure, explicitly built in stone and steel, in a development area, sought by half-constructed commercial centres and by many platisseries in which the middle-class managers - men and women meet for morning business.
According to Kinniklioglu, it could have been a right-wing politician from any other part of Europe.
He's got a Black Berry.
" The purpose of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey was cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look toward the east and the west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of each other.
She was supposed to do both.
"but, at some point, "I asked if" Turkey shouldn't choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "he doesn't want to choose between the two."
He then pointed out a point that almost all those to whom I could speak said with my heart: Turkey's ferred road not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, is therefore both an advantage for Europe and the United States and for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe travelling metaphorically on the routes to Asia and the Middle East.
From returning to the Hydarpasha train station, after another night without sleeping, I retired to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who were following the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European Middle East ambitions could, in large part, be found in Turkey's hands.
While I was waiting for the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey was called "the disease of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that might claim this fascinating country.
Vernon Handley's memoirs, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Being already part of his musical project for the city, it is founded the following year, the fantastic heart of young people, Proteus.
The choir should include at least 21 years of age, but before Proteus was able to sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had been more than 20 years of age refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed in form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the heart to manage any kind of music that was presented to him, whether it was Madrid or Messianic.
The versatility of music produced by such a young heart was often impressive, always exciting, and thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remains constant throughout the years.
Remember how Tod repeated to us to "let music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there, in music.
So sing!"
Its baguatte technique was absolutely clear, precise, even though it never appeared.
Whatever the music standard, it was much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver had to be called a horse, it's good Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the years 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever failed me, and sometimes they've even inspired me.
Tod Handley held that this combination of personal size and modesty was rare.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people."
He'll miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurology by William Woodruff (September 25, 1946) states that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, a MA and a PhD".
That's what is from Woodruff's author's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, and at the same time, a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, was published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to dissimulate this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicent Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition " Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They attracted me to the fact that they are simple and powerful and because they are always treating protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that transmits a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second sale for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitat, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
This adds some refined mechanisms, which increase the comfort of conduct and allow for more substantial savings.
A revolution faces a revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz provides a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation market was placed on the market.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales on other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Just in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz has been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years, is located in the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow her to increase her sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007, the Japanese brand sold 83.000 Honda Jazz in 2009, it considered selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002 which represents 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
The officials of the Spanish branch expected to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
This is precisely the exit of the new Jazz which will allow Honda to scale in large part the sales drop in Spain.
In fact, market officials expect to finish the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, namely 4,000 cars in 2007, or 16% in 2007.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8 per cent, compared to 1.6 per cent last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to receive a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market part when the new model comes out.
It is about Insight, a hybrid with five gates and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
According to markets and estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50 per cent of the sales of Insight will be made to the United States, while the other half will be distributed between the Old Content and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of the next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimetres) and its width is 1.69 metres (two centimetres) and the distance between its axis is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimetres.
On the contrary, the height does not change to 1,52 meters.
The dimensions also increase and the inner space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a reserve of essence in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the buffer - which has a double-founded system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the first generation.
These dimensions are those of the version with an engine 1.4L, as the capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roofs - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, part of the rear gates of the first Jazz which were opened with a angle of 67 degrees.
Engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two basic propellers of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
The two engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces the consumption and emissions of CO2, which makes the engine stronger and increases the engine system.
The first engine 1,2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 Nm at 4,900 r/min.
This propeller - which on previous Jazz reached 78 horses - presents a 5.3 litres of essence to 100 km and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
With regard to the previous propeller, which on previous generation had reached 83 horses, now reaching 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The 'beaille vehicle' that avoids collisions
In order to improve the development of disaster prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time by nature, particularly by the bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, in imitation of the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers from the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with the Research Centre for Science and Technology Advanced at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of the Marks Management, BR23C represents the key to the Nissan security boutique.
This robot will allow vehicles of the brand to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval form that resembles a lot of Nissan's safety bottle.
But most importantly, it is the eyes of the bee, able to see in a angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
In order to acquire this visual function, engineers have put into place what is called a laser localizer (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles located at a distance of two metres and in a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance up to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
"When he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bending its 90-degree or more wheels to avoid collision.
The greatest difference in relation to any other existing system is that the way out is completely instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Migration Laboratory and the main engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can not be moved up or down or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow and not in infinite directions like the bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotational function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second of this device must only process information and act according to these data.
It is not necessary to store information or intuitive logics of prior works, so it can continue with only a few dozen KBs of memory.
This may surprise us, but we don't talk about giga-octettes of memory, or even megaoctes."
This is the first car to develop new technologies for the prevention of collisions, a technology that will be introduced in serial cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot walks with lithium-polymer batteries, which are smaller and last longer than lithium-ions batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles to the road.
They're afraid to be hypothetical.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of liquids to make plans, is not a genius.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel '.
It's the 'Hotel of Bad Credits'... or stories.
The fun aspect of this accommodation and especially the Master of the Hotel invites us to think about several times if it is a good time to ask for a loan.
And, especially, where to do it.
Of course, this game provides useful but not detailed information.
It's another game reserved for teenagers.
What if the game is over?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced his entry into his Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will spend nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new welcome by a strong drop from his Bourse course.
One week after the opening of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MMFG would buy 9.9 per cent of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or a total of $33 billion.
The held price is less than 19 per cent at the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MMFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities by ensuring a 10 per cent return and an equivalent conversion price of $31,25.
Morgan Stanley indicated that the global operation would be conducted on the basis of a unit price of $29, or 28 per cent above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to 23.07 dollars at 1700 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking status," John Mack, director-general of the American group, explained.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which must allow him to diversify his activities but to pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis requires Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had just announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"One week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "Our pensions that participation would be entirely composed of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover us."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley 7% title below their accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MMFG may be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if they change more than 50 per cent above the conversion price, or approximately 47 dollars, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MMFG's capitals will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a group spokesman refused to comment on the strategic projects of the two new alliances.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a balance ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has been saying "cleaning" has relieved his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tested for the group, which has seen its course of Bourse in half as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt decreased.
This cost was reflected on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's hack, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the Republic around the twenty-first century of socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivia Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This morning, at the request of his colleagues and friends, was the third who voted for a new Constitution.
The mission is fulfilled because 64% of the voters voted "yes" at the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the suffering.
According to these results, "no" received 28 per cent, 7 per cent of the outbreaks were zero and 0.7 per cent were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it would have to receive half of the more than one.
On Sunday, two polls from the polling offices and a survey from a non-governmental organization announced a wide victory of "yes" between 63 per cent and 70 per cent.
Rafael Correa had also won the victory of his draft Constitution on Monday night.
The "Constitution has triumphed in an amazing way," he said, commending the Ecuadorians at the governorate's seat in Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As well as well, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The survey, which was conducted in peace according to the United States Observer Mission (OEA), was based on a text in 444 lines confirming the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution confers on the State power over the economy, while preserving the "development planning" of a country that is essentially the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currency.
By Korea, elected in 2006, the project also provides enhanced powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive mandates for four years and will have the possibility of disbanding the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and set up a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further reinforces the principle of freedom of health and education services that the President has begun to impose in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty level.
It finally provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as an starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 o'clocks were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack against the rapists of the 11 tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanying companions held captive for ten days in the desert were gathered this afternoon after a healthy and clean month in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command at Chad.
Apparently, the otags arrived at 1530 hours on board a special aircraft at the Al-Maza military base, hosted at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential bathroom in Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no money has been paid" to the journalists," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Catched on 19 September at a safari in 4x4 along the Ouanat mountain, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been stolen from a cache to another by 35 unknown rapists.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack on the night just before the dawn.
"A exchange of fire shots occurred, and half of the rapists were killed, the others were moving," said the manager who demanded the anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "clear" unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian orders.
The head of Italian diplomat Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he found the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also declined the payment of a ransom.
The guard, the Sudanese army had claimed to have interviewed a 4x4 vehicle on board which was found by the rapists, killing six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were associated with a rebel group of Darfur, the Liberation Movement of the Sudan-United States (SLA-U), which was immediately decommissioned.
Letter - The silent majority of culture
A debate on cultural funding is making shortcomings and is taking place in this electoral campaign.
That's so good.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will be raised to deny the sums of misery given to the small museums, archives, archaeological caves or national historic places that fall asleep in hunger?
What policy will the federal government remember that he denies his monuments and heritage buildings?
What about Quebec, like Canada, do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million and a half euros on the restoration of the only Chinan castle in the valley of Loire?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, the elected and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Companies in Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 companies of history, heritage, archives and genoology are concerned about refurbishing history, preserving with three private archives coins and preserving archaeological remains.
These are, often, the dog of our heritage, who protests with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is a court for history and patrimony?
The Governments of the Benelux nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian and Dutch banks, as the first European banking institution in the event of stress following the bulge of the crisis of the credit market in the United States, partly nationalising the United States. The three countries support a total of EUR 11.2 billion, this financial institution and insurance that also have interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, by also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competitor.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis has been increasing for more than a year, is for the Fortis bank. In some respects, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will acquire almost half (up to 49 per cent) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank will, of course, sell part of its shares, including, firstly, the activities, essentially insurance, which it acquired last year by the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
The last week, the Fortis actions began a vertical fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed in the bank.
The analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go to the failure.
Nothing but Friday, the company's actions decreased by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, more than two thirds of their value has been lost.
Taking into account the current value of the actions, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to company leaders, is not realistic.
The company's leadership is accused of the uncertainty of other Atlantic, with regard to the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, to be the source of the loss of the Fortis actions.
Monday, papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank as the new Director-General.
The financial body was also looking for private buyers, but had not yet received a proposal on the basis.
In the past, the Belgian Government announced that investors should not worry, they should not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the client's circle of the bank and no agency was taken out.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also acquired lising companies.
A Respiratory Respiratory Respiration
In the United States, health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information on their drug purchases.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that allow the use of information on the prescription of medicines, in all cases, to be agreed by the person concerned.
This kind of program must be among the independent hands, but it comes back to trust its wallet in a yard," recalled Richard Dicket, the program creator used to manage the prescriptions of medications in Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on the insurance premium and the capital secured in the event of damage, on the health status of the client present, and if they consider that the risk is too high, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after having been informed of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it is easily available to the pharmaceuticals, the data on the purchases of medicinal products of the person in the tenth months of school. The program itself determines the disease of the person and his health status.
For example, if this person regularly buys strong doses of cholesterol reduction, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some decide at the same time a risk coefficient, so there is nothing more to do to the insurance officer than paper. However, minor problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a medicine can be used for various purposes. For example, some mixtures may be used against migraine or heat pumps, but may also be effective against depression.
This latter is considered by insurance insurance as an increasing risk factor, while others are not.
Companies have developed research and data analysis. They must ask the patient for authorisation before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacovigilance.
In the meantime, they are bound by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their shortcomings in the past.
Some companies have also been dealing with laboratory analysis results, and they are related to the data on drug consumption. In this way, they are able to provide a more precise portrait of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use becomes increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope is limited to practitioners and insurance.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of the authorities concerning enterprises specializing in the provision of data is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he developed even more before his program, which would require the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question to know whether the person concerned is really free to grant his or her agreement because if he refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus and finally, the needles depend on the beauty of the needle.
The Marseille Global Menu
The European Union and India are multiplying by two trade negotiations.
As the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit on other issues, mostly global.
Today, there will also be a French-Inde summit where there will be a major issue of nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union recognized that India was a major emerging democratic power to which it needed to give a broader right of speech in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to agree on their support to New Delhi for its application as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They are not too late on this issue yesterday at the 9th summit organized in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of the diplomat, Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who agreed that in five years, they would multiply by two commercial exchanges, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
In view of the fact that trade between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods has gone from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have legally harmonised the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights. Thus, air exchanges can also take their interest in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation with one side, India, which is the first trade partner of the EU, and the other one, New Delhi, which is only the ninth place among the EU partners.
The summit drew attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was severely condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the need for a United Nations conference on this issue was raised.
The completion of the Doha commercial cycle was also requested, although both had a large share in the current deficit.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to reduce at least twenty per cent of its toxic wastes by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need for a global market to be passed at the climate conference next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in the price of food goods, and they supported the convening of an international working meeting to review the financial crisis.
The head of the Indian State is now in the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of EUR twenty billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the information provided by the press agency, the agreement would take 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian editors at the International Hall of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, make the most important international in the exchange of rights.
The International Chamber of the book of Frankfurt awaits this edition, with more than seven thousand exhibitors coming from 101 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square metres of the Hall with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as an guest of honour.
This will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with an Italian point of 264 square metres.
It will be followed by you with the press in the Room Structure, on the Buchmesse 5.0 map: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and perspectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author's books has gradually decreased in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular in relation to adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire fired a year ago.
The plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire, disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying on the Nevada Desert, was found.
Debris were found on a square of 3,000 metres high in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, raised the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is good for him on which Steve Fosset would travel the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
So the sheriff explained that no human remains were found on the plane or around.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) informed that a team of investigators sent to the premises a few hours after reopening the envelope, identified the device: it was well known by Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, when Fosset landed in Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their apartment of Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, the kind of money and a pulse.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had been given a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, he had turned the world into a plane and without a ladder.
Among all these records, it was also the one to fly at 15445 metres high on the Andes, but with a pair.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the common original and well-defined design, marked lines, surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the "compacts" off-roads of the house of the star, with whom Mercedes-Benz tried to give a fresh air in this sector.
Only from its outside standard, unexpected and unconventional contents will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October next.
Thus the advertising battalion that will accompany the start of the new car will lead to an undisputed mode of communication, through a future 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi showcased in three different stages, which will dominate the heart of the Milanian shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special moons distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that looking at the image, the car comes out of the display.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Elimina8, the new Glk will be lit according to the spots, in all its details, to then reposition itself into a single image.
It is obvious that with this publication, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the steroidal field of car communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of the future conquerors? We'll see.
Here's the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they're at risk of the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls who are now respected by Italy? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and who have never created serious problems so far.
He's never been successful with the opposite typhoes.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verone, Padue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) of Campania and the Pouilles have been added.
They had three-coloured tapes on which their original city appeared: Saturday evening, they were all removed so that they would not be identified.
They're inspired by the English typhoes.
In Bulgaria, they found a real Nazi typhoser, that of Levski.
Figc had set up Italian typhoes, 144 tickets for the party: all nominals, and therefore easily controlled.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who were part of Sofia, no one had a Daspo in progress, no one had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian typhoes that had a history of state crime, had no right to the ticket, and could not move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then take measures: in this case, it may be possible that the typhoes arrested or identified in the massacres will be producing a Daspo for at least five years .
An international Daspo which prohibits the frequentization of Italian states, but also Europeans.
In short, our hooligans will no longer walk into the city.
Good luck.
But now is the time for the threat of emulation: that is, others are at risk of adding to the hundred and fifty first ones.
"We must spread this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," supports the Viminal.
So, "Keep your eyes open, especially in view of the game of the national team of Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Pouiles there is actually a small branch of Italian ultrasounds.
Tomorrow, the Observatory will meet, Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of Asia, i.e. secret services, which deal directly with state problems.
"Doce-Duce's hearts, and the arm held during Mamel's bleeding? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here is the opinion (expressed in a very unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, who has been the director of the Viminal Observatory (he has taken the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli was a prefect in Trieste, where he lived in a support boat of the Ultras Italian group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli said, that in Bulgaria, rent Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhoes has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - add the Observatory's No. 1 to the crimes must be attributed to the country in which the fact prevails.
Until now, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see clearly what has happened, and we will evaluate it for the future.
But we're also talking about signs against Mamel's mother: those there are not crimes either, but if you let me, they're not cops..."
