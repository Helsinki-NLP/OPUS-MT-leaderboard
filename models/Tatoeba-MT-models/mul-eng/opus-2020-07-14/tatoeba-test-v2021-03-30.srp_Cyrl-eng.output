Put a book on top of the police.
The simplicity is the top priority.
What does he live for?
What would I do without you?
You're unattended.
That's new.
Please, sit down.
Tom's on my nerves.
It works together.
I'm probably never gonna use this anymore.
You're a man.

Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember my name.
What do you like most about the way?
Tom suggested that Maria go to the doctor.

I'm a professor.
Where do you live?
Why would I want everything to kill you?
He bought it at the store.
She took care of her son.
We've survived some way.
I thought Tom wasn't doing what he should do.
He stopped smoking.
I have a cat and a dog.
Don't thank me.
What's the difference?
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what does that have to do with you?
I just got up.
What's the feeling?
My dog is blind, but he likes to get out and walk away.
It was supposed to be like this.
I don't like working.

Are we ready for a walk?
Why?
Tom's drunk like a stream.
Never lose hope.
It was just a cake sleigh.
Choose one.
He got what he wanted.
She's drinking like milk.
They need each other.
Did you report to the police?
He's moving.
Meet me with Tom.
After a long consideration, I finally thought I was doing things.
You're right.
Tom's unmerciful.
Thermiti eat wood.
You missed me.
What's this?
Me, too.
That was very good.
She's running an account about her old mother.
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before he crossed the street.
Go right.
It's just like a puzzle.
It's empty.
Where'd you get that idea?
Maria called.
I'm leaving.
I can't sit still.
Happy Easter!
I owe you an apology.
Which way are you going?
Please read between the rows.
I ran at speed.
The wind is cheap and pure source of energy.
I almost forgot the passport.
Why do you do that if I can ask?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Give me an example.
What's tomorrow?
Can you give me an example?
Tom's drinking like a smug.
Is that what you want?
It doesn't look like you.
I see, but I don't see.
We're close friends.
Tom was completely drunk.
How many people live on Earth?
Let it be you.

Is this a real diamond?
Are you free tonight?
I like to see you while you play.
They replaced it with oil.
The snow fell.
How can I say that in your language?
That's not a good sign.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I'm glad to see you again.
Why are you acting like this?
He doesn't miss anything.
We live in the atomic era.
Mary's working for a life-threatening.
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Did you sleep enough last night?
It wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a little bit?" "Yes, Rick."
I don't care about anything today.
This is Brian Rock.
Two guys ran out of the room.
It's never too late to learn.
We have to find them first.
Tom was very scared.
A snowfall.
You can't blame all Tom.
Tom seemed a lot different after the blast.
Tom's on my way to life.
I'm learning now.
When did you come home?
He asked me to help him.
This is not true.
I took the first step.
Can you keep the secret?
I aired once.
Don't waste your words.
Did you deliberately do that?
Don't get involved.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good joke.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think I should write to Tom?
We ran out of town.
I'm the starter.
This tea is good.
Close your mouth while you're crying, screaming, or screaming.
I bought this yesterday.
Are you speaking Greek?
It's all been played with the speed of light.
What's your story?
I upset him.
I made sure I didn't see it.
I was trying to be kind.
Don't come in!
Success was only partial.
I'm not always sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The insurance is overheating.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We were protesting peacefully.
Maria was angry like a rice.
Turn left.
Don't you sing!
I know how much you do.
I can take away everything except a test.
I paid for it.
Did you bring the fan?
You're under oath.
That I knew at least.
I don't believe it.
Are you looking for something specific?
Don't worry!
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
I took the party.
It's my cat.
Stay there.
He's known as a great painter.
Why are you mad at me?
What's your name on the Bosnian?
Tom traveled to the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
I'll go.
What's all this mess about?
I don't understand why they're so good friends.
This is a book.
The bedroom's on the floor.
What's wrong with you?
She hated him.
What are you gonna do today?
Taxi's a collection.
Logic is obviously your strong side.
I'd love to kiss you.
He told me I was cute.

In this phase of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There's no one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he would write it, he would know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I got my regular payment to keep my honest thinking out of the news I do. Many of you are also similarly paid for the same things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what honestly think, would be on the streets, in search of someone else's job.

Just slow down!
I hate you from the bottom of my soul.
Tell him.
Do you want to learn something?
We're going to get a bus.
The Pizza girl and Mr. Casha are walking in the woods.
Anyway, you're not right.
Ridicoses are driving me crazy!
A man has a lot of desires that he doesn't really want to do, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise.He wants them to remain only wants; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be for his grave disappointment.

I can't do that either.
You don't even know his name, do you?
The bullet passed through his body.
They know you.

We're acting unprejudiced.
They've been leading love all night.
I can't do that either.
You know your rights.
Thinking is very important.
That's new.
I have a lot of friends.
Can I talk to you alone?
