Triumf of the legal population in Rakouska, totalled 29 per cent
Citizen weakening of both sides of the major coalition and the significant strengthening of the rights of the populist parties led to the first preliminary results of the early parliamentary elections in Rakosko.
In particular, a strong loss suffered by the Rakouska People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelma Molter has been seriously undermined.
Instead, the volunteer leader of Svazu for the future of Rakouska (BZÖ), the Croatian heytman Jörg Haider is seeking a triumphal return to national policy.
According to the preliminary results, the country's most powerful party in the social democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 per cent of votes against the last vote since 2006, however, it loses 5.5 per cent.
The increase in the number of OVPs is still high, which is about 25.6 per cent of the votes cast.
These are the worst results of both of these great parties in the history of the Raquesian holiday, and in particular in the people who had previously voted for the election, the fate of the disaster.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP emerged from college, people in preference to SPÖ had a significant shock.
However, it was obvious that the people were concerned about leaving the government behind.
In the first reactions, speculation on possible rejection of the chairman and the delivery vice-president, Wilhelm Molter.
The Court finds that this could be done by Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the presidency.
Such a development would obviously facilitate the path to the most likely outcome of the voluntary outcome and to the restoration of the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free-Free (FPÖ) were mainly 18 per cent and the BZÖ received a eleven per cent vote - but the social democratic guarantee expressed concern about the withdrawal of 1999 when the people agreed with the population (at the same time, the FPÖ left BZÖ in 2005) to the common government, which even imposed sanctions on the European Union.
In this development, Hayder, who has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party and intends to return to Vienna to the whole state policy.
The Green Party has yet reached Parliament, which has lost easily and has fallen between the French political parties from the third to the fifth place.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the four-percent threshold and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be maintained
If it failed to solve the problem with Czech scientists who were upset by the illegal collection of brooches in India, Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg would have come to the conclusion of the Czech-Indical Relations.
The Minister introduced it to New York after a meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranabe Mukhardji.
"If it hadn't been resolved, then yes, then it would have come to a certain settlement," he said after a meeting that had taken place from the Czech initiative.
Mukherdzi said after the trial, the court can handle a very difficult situation.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petra Šváchy, who was released of the complaint and was sentenced to trial, the central government may join the local government in Daržiling, whose jurisdiction falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kucer, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mukhhardji to appeal to a higher court.
He can then ask for release from prison and to wait for freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also appeared when he met.
"It recommends a call to a higher court, then it would be possible to forgive him," said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way that the Czech side can fully enter is to provide an appropriate "competence of legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help is already available to them by an Indian side.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining with India the best relations that have long-term traditions.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
Similarly, as the Czech Republic pointed out before its partner, the problem of Czech entomologists was of great importance.
"We truly consider the great mistake of the imprisonment and regret of these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question whether he had received from the Indian side of the matter was about to be taken away by the Minister.
"I've already reached a considerable amount of promises," he just noticed.
The Battle of the South Seas
It belongs to a printed electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent maritime area are located.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but the little point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, along with it and the adjacent sea bottom.
The area is also large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to a trinitarian team of the Division of the OSCE for Oceans and Sea Law.
His chief, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors and sometimes supplements.
It's the government's office of work and the superhero.
The bottom of the sea is still a little known world, rich in natural resources.
It can be found here in pink, red and other non-growth raw materials, but it is also known for living organisms that do not need the key to producing cancer.
Of a fat content, by weight, by weight, by weight, by weight, by weight, by weight,
The coastal states have now begun to come to a new southern region.
According to the UN agreement, they also exercise their rights agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of a so-called Continental Shelf, which often drys up to a few hundred miles from the border of the given country.
This has an exceptional advantage under the terms of the contract on all sources of continental shelf.
"Simply, however, the continental shelf has this part of the seabed and its base, which is naturally the continuation of the continent under the sea.
Sea salt for the coastal sea borders, often also for the borders of two hundred marine miles, such as an exceptional economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country to the Commission to limit the external limits of the continental shelf must be submitted by extensive scientific documentation based on a number of cost-effective studies and measurements.
It's the result of a series of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and professional technical assistance.
The Commission has already delivered five applications, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three last-mentioned countries have been successful yet," adds Mikulka.
The world’s voice recently noted Australia’s success, which, as a first major expansion of its coastal states.
But the New Zealand - the area of the sea day, which the Commission acknowledged last week, is about 1.6 million square miles [1.6 million sq km], and the collapse is six times greater than the size of the state itself.
The two countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The blessing they receive in the future from the use of the seabed will be priceless, as they promise.
It shall submit its requests progressively to other States.
They can do this up to ten years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay contract.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the ocean floor area, legally declared as "the common heritage of mankind".
There's no state standing out here anymore.
The law of difficulties in this area shall make a contract concluded by the international institution.
"The bottom of the sea, but there is no clondak," says Director Mikulka in his statement that "the single areas are clearly separated and their regime is legally enforced."
Chechnya in Pacific
Part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It's dealing with other states of some Eastern block within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was obtained in 1991 according to the contract, like investors in a few other states, the status of a "pro-component investor".
He has the right to stay in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, which lies between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The investor examined the area is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
There's an article there, it's about any of the Tater's Southern Replica.
"It can weigh on the surface of a total radius of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, honey, cobalt and manganese," states another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian worker Rober Sandev's division brings to the show one such concrete.
It mentions a little hamburger or, at the expense of fantasy, a poor scheme that the legend has preserved for Golem.
German units of special detection were released by hand
The Egyptian government asked for assistance from experts in resolving the crisis with German handshake.
When the situation was solved, special units were prepared, however, not to be found.
Further details of the situation of liberation of eleven European tourists in Egypt are progressively available to the public.
In the case of rescue actions, German special forces were not directly involved, according to the data provided by the defence ministers and within.
According to the Ministerial Declaration, both members of the anti-terrorist group of the German GSG9 police, of the federal police, of the Federal Criminal Authority and also of the logistics experts from the Technical Aid Service (Technisches Hilfswerk).
However, according to another communication, two ministers from the German authorities on Monday, however, did not have to go because the prisoners had let their employees go and stopped when they recognized the signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government in front of Germany accepted the aid offered as a supporting force for action on the ground.
"There is no happiness," said one of the speakers of the Ministry of Social Affairs inside.
The competitors destroyed a group of passengers composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians and eight of their Egyptian leaders on the south of Egypt on September 19th.
After their exile in the desert area south of Egypt, they moved hand in foreign lands between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the defendants remained unclear until the last moment, as well as the details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At the same time, there are stocks in Kahira.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of arms is in the hands of the German ambassador.
He didn't show up for the details of his release.
In Berlin, there is no information available when the storage is returned to Germany.
According to the "Bild" list, all five tourists should also fly with the special forces to one of the German airports and reach Germany in the afternoon.
The American Dream Representative has stopped the rescue package
The first chamber of the United States Congress allowed a strong majority to drop a saved package for the financial market at $700 billion.
The index of Down Jones went down a lot.
In the range of 206 to 227 votes, the American Snömovna represented a government rescue package for the financial markets.
In spite of all the challenges of American President George W. Bush and the main policies, both sides of the programme, which should address chaos in financial markets, did not find a majority.
The Dramatic Action, however, hoped that the remaining ones would still be convinced by the $700 billion package criticism.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic leaders, called on the House to vote in favour of the agreement, even though the plan is not popular, as it turned out.
"It is difficult to get political recognition to avoid something that has not yet come," he admitted.
During the vote, the Daw Jones index went down by more than six percent, which was about 600 points.
The reason was the concern of investors that a state-guarded package could be broken.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised so that the volume of the package would again disappear.
The team members are now counting with other major turbulence on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to be able to enter into force, there is a need for agreement between the shadow representatives and the Senate.
Travel agents register growing booking numbers
It seems that winter will be good for German businessmen on the road:
According to one study, there was a significant increase in the booking for the next month compared to the previous year - in the winter season, even more than 30 per cent.
Despite poor economic growth, the taste for Germans remains constant.
In the winter season, travel offices reported a 31 per cent increase in turnover during the same period of the year as the German Railway Force (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRW) in Berlin in Monday.
According to the study of the GfK market research institute, the increased booking numbers have already been available for the past month.
Thus, according to the DRAV statement, it was estimated that approximately 1 per cent higher than 2007.
On the basis of these results, GfK numbers are estimated each month to estimate data on reservations from 1200 German travel offices and to interpolate them on the whole market.
As a result, reservations were included that reached the end of August 2008.
Due to the poor dollar rate, the U.S. highway has been requested first, the DRW has given.
On these roads, he makes a reservation of about one third.
In this regard, in Germany, there are in particular the required objectives of Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
Firstly, organized races are in the course, the president of the DRW Klaus Laepple announced.
In view of the relative cost of energy and food, the costs are "for a customer can be read more easily than individually organised".
Laepple explained that the money can save consumers apart from the use of discounts for temporary booking or all-inclusive offers.
Also in the years, the booking number was very good, so compared with the previous year, there will be a higher turnover - even though, according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first October
The perfect repacked poppy, beer from the tubs and prominent in the corners of the famous designers.
First on the beer shop.
Susanne Kronzuker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blond, a television moderator, and she's wearing an eardrum.
I've got dark hair, I'm a student, and my hat is a second hand.
One thing, however, is that we're not even three minutes on the blue hole, and we're already being hit by the photographers and the death of the full memory cards - it's my fault, because I'm on October first.
That's how you can be friends.
Looks like my left leg fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the club's equivalent, and that's how my sense of comfort in the circle was more limited.
But right after the entrance to Theresienwiese, it's better than it seems.
Nearly everyone has a woman’s neck or a leather shirt; no one looks down or down - everything is completely normal.
Special views in the bathroom with the bathroom in the chocolate are only my backyard.
One Mnichovanka warned me that I was wrong to say, "You're free on the left, in the middle of the lady, right on the back, right on the back."
I can move the mask behind the left.
"All right," he says and laughs.
The rest of the subtylized flirting techniques don't stay so long and they have a simple flat cap with the letter "This dunk will get dressed!" and they blow on the back of their noses.
The young man with such exhibitionist clubs is named Bob, from England, and to October came for the first time.
It looks like "gorgeous" with a prolonged "dark."
It's gonna tell me after he's gone for the right kiss.
Right next to one of those hydrants, where everyone thinks they're waste bones.
Bob is then one of the feared "Wildbieslers" as in Bavorsk is said to be publicly free of violence.
The rest of us are lucky to get rid of this way of alcohol.
About eight evenings are running around the surface where Octoberfest runs, hopefully doctors who have to take care of the dangerous drinks.
Healthy people always show up in the backyards - four carry a cover from the apartment to the apartment.
They work like most visitors' blue holes: empty there, full back.
Whoever's lying under the bed of this bunker, he won't see.
"That's the only one that can't go on anymore," called me in answer to my question, one of the doctors and disappears into the roof.
Police have published the name of the victim of an accident.
The name of a three-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being hit by a car in Essexu was published.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon came by Carol Paulson from the dark Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 11-year-old man was arrested for questioning the apparent journey.
He's already been released from the police prison.
Turkish diplomatic sights are expanding
Long before Turkey began attempting to enter the European Union, the European powers sought to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the east coast of Bospor, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, is one of the best memories of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasa railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neo-resensant case.
Then they'll tell you the tour guide.
The building is situated at the end of the exhibition with the candles on every corner, in view of the absence of a distinction from some provincial German workshop.
The stone's spicy.
The whole building's kind of falling apart.
But once a person gets inside the stolen treasure, he can no longer have any doubts about the size of the company that was the most western defense station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Consortium Anatolysko-Baghdádska Corporation.
Germany, which later joined the empire, had in mind its ambition for the rule of the Middle East with the help of this railway that was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and still on the territory of South Arabia today.
But the German imperial ambitions broke out during the first world war.
Their followers were attacked by Lawrence from Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding lands caused by frozen borders of the war learned is gone
British and colonial units have processed from Egypt and printed Turkey and their German connections from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news has also come to Hydarpash stations.
In 1917 he destroyed the explosion of the municipal train by her abandoned arrow.
The Turkish sources say it's about sabotage.
From that time on, she's gradually getting upset, and things are happening to her.
Today, however, this barrier to Anatolia and continues to serve in the east - at least symbolic - in order to raise the growing issues of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding lands caused by frozen borders of the war learned is gone.
Now the new policy is being implemented - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to examine the parameters of this new policy, I sat on a night train in the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I had to meet with one of the former ACP experts on foreign policy, Turkish Ambassador Suat Kinniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a short journey along the roads that reminded the ancient world's rhythms of the famous night mail document, I reached the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, which wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents the strength of the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
In the background, she raised doubts, especially in Washington.
Tax brought me to the main state of AKP, ultra-modern stone and metal buildings, designed to be developed with the property, surrounded by half of the houses and shops in power, where the middle managers in business clothes - men and women - meet to do quick early business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a medium-term policy with almost every other European political party.
I'm sure he had Blackberry, too.
"The purpose of the foreign policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its closest environment.
The student war was anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its purpose.
Today we have to look at the east and the west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
I had to do both.
"But it's definitely coming in a moment," I asked myself, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turecko," he said, "you didn't want to come to such a decision."
He then highlighted what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost to remember: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea, are the same as with the support of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on the deck it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically, be said to go along these paths to the east of Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasa Station, after most of the night, I thought of the two German Mr. Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who were watching how this building was built centuries ago.
How surprised they would be to find that European ambitions in the Middle East can now be, in fundamentally, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting at the airport for a ride back over to Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
So it doesn't seem that there was a lot of mistake at least then that the continent would have to have a finger on this fascinating country.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a guildford music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (narrow, September 11th) had at the age of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the congregation.
As part of the annual musical program, he founded this year on a beautiful congregation of young Proteus.
He had to be 21 years old, but at the time Proteus sang the last song in 1979, a few of us were about 30 - we simply refused to give up.
The name "Proteus" (a mythological variable of things) represented the desire and ability of the congregation to be allowed into any song that was presented to him - whether it was already made or the Messiah, whether alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often exciting, always inspiring, and all thanks to the inspiration of the only man and the songs that remained simply unchanged throughout the time.
As Tod often told us only to "let the song speak for ourselves."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in that song.
So sing it!"
His tactical technique was very clear and precise, but it wasn't even a dictator or a flower.
Even though he was a musical standard anywhere, he always invited him.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was to be some leader fit on the guitar, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well for two decades when he was leading the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I've studied more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been one of them lost - and I've been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personality traits.
He hated the leaders, who, according to his word, simply "sold one or two pecks around the world."
He'll miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your nephew William Woodruff (September 25, 1946) claims that "he returned to the economic history of Oxford in 1946 and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's author's notes in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he studied economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he did a dissertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and in 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
We don't know why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philosophy College
"I recommend José Vicente Resiny's exhibition "Flamenco and life" because his documentary black photographs are amazing.
They gave me a simple and strong struggle, with which to win, and the dignity and respect for the photographed.
A show that shows a lot of other people.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda's going to compete with her bestseller.
In November, Honda began selling the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the leader of this single-range vehicle already has a significant space, he now offers even more spacious interior.
This includes improved motors that increase the comfort of the drive and allow more fuel support.
Evolution is more than a revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although the lines of the new Jazu are very similar to the previous model from the aesthetic view, there have been many changes in this single-range vehicle.
You need to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger sizes and new engines.
Before we examine a new model, it should be noted that new Jazz comes to the market six years after the first generation was introduced.
So the first thing we're looking at is the fact that Honda needed this model in a shorter period than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a less famous model in Europe, on the other hand, he became a phenomen sales.
This is perhaps the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the biggest producer in 2002, and also during the 2008 year.
In Japan, since the introduction of Hondy Jazz to the market, nearly a million customers have been sold.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million sold coins in six years.
However, Honda is preparing for the purpose of increasing the sale of new Jazz into her category.
Thus, in 2007, this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Hondy Jazz, and in 2009 the revenues were 100 000 cars, which would mean a 17% increase in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold almost 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model, meaning 6.7% of Hondy's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazzu, the management of the Spanish territory is expected to sell 2,000 custodials a year.
The arrival of the new Jazzo allows Honde to significantly reduce sales in Spain.
The driving of the car so de facto awaits the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sold customers, meaning 4 000 less than in 2007 and a down of 16 %.
Honda, despite this increase in sales, increased its share in the Spanish market by 1.8 %, to 1.6 % in the last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company is expected to reach 2%.
To achieve this part, Honda depends on the success of his next new model.
It has Honda Insight, a five-way hybrid compact size with a length of 4,37 meters, from which the Japanese company has pledged a worldwide sales of about 200,000 pieces a year.
According to the Japanese producer, 50 % of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage is divided by the old continent and Japan.
The start of the Hondy Insight sale is expected in the first months of the next year when the public will be present in Valencia in January.
In contrast to the first generation, all the sizes were increased in the new Jazzo.
Its length increased to 3,9 meters (five inches above), width to 1,69 meters (two inches above) and width to a height of 2,5 meters, meaning a length of five inches.
The height hasn't changed yet, and it's still going to be 1,52 meters.
The increase in size also resulted in an increase in the inner area.
However, these benefits were achieved by using new platforms, but by placing the fuel tank in the middle of a vehicle that was already used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
The area of the port area - which is available on the second day system - has increased to 399 litres, of 19 litres more than the area of the port area in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are provided in version 1.4 of the engine, because the width of the rear space at Hondy Jazz 1.2 makes 379 litres.
In addition to the external elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment designed by a panoramic beam - it is easier to access the rear seat.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow the opening of 80 degrees of transport 67 in the first Jazz model.
In the second generation of Hondy Jazz, there are new engines.
From the start, this small model will be offered with two gas engines 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technologies that allow lower consumption, lower emissions of carbon dioxide, and bring excellent improvements to the ground system at the same time as high-point time in the full range of engine power.
The first engine of 1,2 litres has a output of 90 horses at 6 000 points with a maximum exact moment 114 Nm at 4,900 points.
This engine - which had a previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has 5,3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
In contrast to the previous engine, which has reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and a 128 grams of CO2.
"A car's cover" prohibits wounds.
I do not agree with the progress made in the development of anti-Technology, Nissan has now inspired in the field, in particular in the field.
This Japanese company created a robot that was taken for the example of flying the train and thus banned soldiers.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in fighting prevention technologies.
Engineering Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robotics developed in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technology Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhira Doie, director-general of public relations for technology, research and character development, BR23C is presented as an extension of four parts of the Nissan security shield.
The robot has a task to strengthen the ability to prevent fighting in vehicles of this sign.
During the summer each train will create its own personal space for the wild beast, which is very similar to the safety shield of Nissan.
The most important, however, are the complex eyes that are capable of seeing all directions at a rate of more than 300 degrees, including allowing you to fly in your personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, engineers designed what they called Laser Range Finder.
This shall indicate the obstacles which shall be located up to 180 metres in the distance of BR23C, the distance of the object shall be calculated, and shall send a signal to the ballistic microprocessor, which shall immediately be transmitted to the front of the wheel.
"At the moment when a breach is recorded, the worker may have a similar effect on movements and immediately change the direction of the movement to the right or even greater purpose in order to prevent war.
The greatest difference in sales of any existing system is the fact that all moving manoeuvres are simply instinctive.
If that wasn't the case, the robot would not be able to react sufficiently quickly to avoid interrupting," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and the main engineer of the project.
The robot cannot move the direction up and down and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to a direction which is allowed by the impact of its wheel, however, in the infinite number of directions and possibilities as well as the angle.
That's why he didn't use the rotary function to prevent the robot from fighting.
"The device needs only every couple of seconds to process the information and to keep it informed.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuitions from previous manoeuvres, which can function without interrupting with only two dozen KB memory.
It may surprise you, but We do not speak to anyone about the gypsy or the mega."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate prevention of conflict, technology in which Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are light and lasting longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the installation of units into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead to the target and then to the obstacle to the road.
Use your fear before taking a mortgage
It should be acknowledged that the US Finance Ministry, in addition to having sufficient capital to deliver the injection, is not missing or discovered.
Faces in the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages in the bank with incorrect solvency, he created a popular-educated "Bad Credit Hotel" game online.
Or "Hotel of Bad Credits"... or a popular hotel.
The hotel, and especially its receptionists, seem tired of asking a person once, twice and three times to think about whether this is the right time to ask for faith.
And first of all, where to ask what is likely to be her purpose.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even if you don't agree with details.
This page is more suitable for young people than space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
A dream room will appear inside the hotel.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens his MMFG capital
The bankhouse Morgan Stanley reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that issues nine billion dollars to earn 21% of its capital, has made a significant decrease in its course on the bridge.
A week after their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MMFG was willing to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s regular shares at a single price of $25.25, representing a total amount of $33 billion.
The combined price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of the securities to 31 August.
The MMFG Bank invests another six billion dollars to obtain convertible securities, which will provide 10% of its profit and its variable price of $31,25.
Morgan Stanley stressed that the entire operation would be carried out on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 % under his current course.
Morgan Stanley still lost 6.79% and reached $23.07 about 17.00 in Greenwich time.
"This strategic hearing represents an important opportunity for the move to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to the bankholding status," John Mack, director-general of this American group, explained.
The new statute adopted Morgan Stanley last week, which should allow him to distinguish his activities, but it also takes place under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His discussion with MMFG also confirms that the current financial crisis calls for the biggest axis of Wall Street to take a far more careful approach than before.
The conditions set out in the sub-division, however, indicate that the agreement has been changed over the past few days: Morgan has only announced that it sells up to 20% of its shares to Japan for a total of $8.5 billion.
"We were thinking a week ago," he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, "that our participation will be entirely composed of ordinary actions.
However, in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to limit the risk to a minimum and also cover."
On the basis of the estimated average price, MMFG pays for Morgan Stanley's securities by 7 % less than their accounting value.
The operation will result in a reduction in profit from the share of approximately 20%.
The agreement assumes that the MMFG will be able to convert the share of its preferential securities into normal shares over a year if the latter are named after a certain period of 50 % of the exchange price, i.e. 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures him that the capital that will bring MMFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his productivity.
However, the speech group refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of both new associations.
Following the investment of MuFG, Morgan Stanley would have to collapse with the payment capacity of Tier One around 15 %, thus one of the best in the sector.
Morgan made sure that since the end of August, he's "sounded" down his balance sheet.
The last few weeks have been critical for the group, since its bourgeois course has fallen by half, while certain costs against the risk of non-payment related to the debt of the plant have been incurred.
However, these costs in the subsidized sector have remained high, around 12 %.
Last week Goldman Sachs announced, the only other "liver" from Wall Street's big investment banks near Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and bought Merrill Lynch for $15 billion, which is partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffetta.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quitu.
Re-establishing the Republic around socialism in the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Huga Cháveze, Bolivian Eva Moralese and Equator Rafael Correy.
Last week, the third so-called vote was proposed, by the pattern of its colleagues and friends, by the proposal of the new Constitution.
Its mission was fulfilled, namely 64% of the voters, according to the official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the referendum "an".
"No" according to these results was 28 %, 7 % of the votes were unpaid and 0.7 % of the votes were empty.
In order to accept the proposal of the Constitution, he had to get half of the votes plus one.
Two studies conducted in the east of the polling stations and the proposal of the non-governmental organization announced a clear "an" victory on Sunday, with a 63 % to 70 %.
Rafael Correa last night, on Monday afternoon, asked for the victory of his proposal for a Constitution.
"The exhibition won the whole of the square," he assured and thanked Ecvadorans in the seat of the governorate Guayaquil, 180 kilometers south-west of Quita.
Of course, Rafael Correa has been blessed by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean successor, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the United States Organization of America (OEA), was at peace, was subject to the text of 444 paragraphs of the future "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution entrusts the power of the State to the economy by giving it the "development plan" of a country that lives primarily from the oil burden of foreign companies and from the dividends that send its immigrants.
The proposal protected by Correou, which was elected in 2006, also broadens the powers of the Head of State, who will be able to carry out two future four-year term of office and have the possibility of leaving the record.
Correa has already announced that this right will be applied and will become a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, on the other hand, accords the principle of free health and education, which the President has begun to implement in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it is also counted as a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which terminates the agreement between Washington and Quitt on the use of an Ecuadorian base as an exit point of American anti-drug operations.
In Chad, 19 hands were released
The Egyptian command launched an attack on eleven tourists and their eight-day tour, which took place ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian leaders, who were held in the wilderness for ten days, were transferred to the capital of Egypt in the second half of their lives and health.
During the morning, the Egyptian command was released in Chad.
The crew flew around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on the deck of a special aircraft on a military base al-Maza, closely associated with the international airport in Cairo.
At the same time, they were transferred without the possibility of being able to express themselves in print, on the floor of the helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, the square of Kahari's residence, to be covered by medical examinations.
"They're all healthy" and "no expense has been paid to foreigners," Egypt's Minister of Tourism Zohejr Garran announced on a train trip.
From its dedication on September 19, during the Safari in a vehicle with all four wheels at the foot of Mount Aunat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hand-cars was pulled from one cover to another 35 strangers unknown.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, one border officer of the Egyptian agency, the organizer of the Safari.
A certain lead representative of the Egyptian security components indicated that 30 members of the special units who approached the site at the foot of two helicopters appeared at the close of the night quietly before dawn.
"There was a shot, half of the hostages were killed and the others were killed," said this source, which he wanted to stay in anonymity.
He noted that almost 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the unit "blek" were sent to Sudan, where they received support from the German and Italian commanders.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini, who is from Belgrade, mentioned the role of secret agents and components of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and effectiveness of people from our secret services, from special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also claimed that it would be paid out.
The Sudanese army announced on the previous night that the guard had kept a vehicle with all four wheels on which the plane was located, killing six of them, including the German commander and two of them.
The army claimed that they were joined by a group of rebels in Darfur, Hungary for the liberation of the Sudan (SLA-U), which immediately refused.
Publications - The quiet majority of the cultural resort
The debate on the financing of culture is full of headlines and is the topic of a pre-trial campaign.
I'm getting better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise to announce the poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national memorial sites that enjoy the cold?
What policy will it take to remind the federal government that they remember their memories and their historical buildings?
That in Quebec, just like in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government owe three and a half million euros to the restoration of a Chinese prison in the Loiry Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that it must be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all national organisations, in fact.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the History of Quebec, it strengthens at least 40,000 volunteers associated with 211 companies for history, memory, archives and genoology about the spread of history, the preservation of a collection of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for a few minors.
Often these companies are just watching the dogs of our memories, which the hounds hope to protest when the promoters and leading actors leave their buldozers on old stones and forgotten graveyards.
When are we finally waiting for the courts for history and memory?
Government Beneluxu National Bank fortis
The state of Benelux assists the Belgian-Holand Bank fortis, which, as a first step in Europe, has become difficult because of the widespread impact of the American mortgage market, partly by means of a statement: three countries support the monetary and insurance institution, which also has a capital share in Hungary, a share of 11.2 billion euros.
This week, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed to take part in the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Economic Competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first in the euro area to be seen as a precedent in the international financial markets as part of the crisis.
Within the meaning of the decision that occurred on Sunday night, it buys all three states about half (49 per cent) of the bank's foreign property.
The bank sells its share of its capital shares, especially then - mainly insurance - activities purchased in the last year by the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The Fortis banks began to close last week, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of the crisis have already appeared in the institution.
However, the analysts agree that with their 85 thousand employees, the bank is too big to let it go.
The company's valuable paper dropped by only 12 per cent on Friday, at 14 years of age.
From an ice-cream value of more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, however, according to business leaders, this is unrealistic.
The management of the company is ultimately responsible for the loss of Fortis's share of security on the maritime market related to the adoption of an American package plan of $700 billion.
In the afternoon, the shares were still standing quietly.
On Friday, a new director general, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to the head of the bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, and no one had ever reported with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors don't have to worry about their money.
There's been no panic among the clients of the bank, and the sections were not covered by the attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a private branch and has also acquired several lising companies.
Leukka in the kitchen
Health and health insurance in the United States, based on the data from people on the purchase of medicines, often end up with the conclusion of an insurance contract.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme which considers the use of data on the prescription of medicinal products in any case for the authorisation of the person concerned.
This must be in the hands of someone independent, or we believe the chicken leaf," quotes Washington Post Richard Dicka, author of a program designed to monitor prescriptions.
Insurance companies shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health status of the beneficiaries, and where the risk is assessed as too large, insurance shall not be excluded.
Previously, they had sent medical examinations and concluded the contract only if they knew their results.
Ten years ago Dick developed a much easier process: on the basis of the identification number of patients from a doctor, he will find out which medicines he bought in the last year and half of which the program itself produces, which he suffers from and which is his health status.
For example, if you regularly buy a large number of medicines to reduce cholesterol, it shows that it has practically no control over high levels of blood vessels, which immediately leads to a high risk category.
There are now several versions of the programme, some of which identify the current risk coefficient, so there is certainly no work to be done in addition to papering, even though there are small difficulties.
The absence of evidence indicates that lactics can be used for several purposes, for example, for example, against migraines or hot spots, but are effective against depression.
They represent a significant rise in the risk of commercial insurance, which is not the first to be mentioned.
For the purpose of requesting and processing the data, special companies were established which were previously provided with the necessary information by the physician asking the patient for authorisation.
The authorities are already in need of it, perhaps they are not concerned about their own incompatibility.
Some companies are currently working on the results of laboratory studies that relate to the data on the medicinal products used, which will enable them to provide even more accurate images of the patient’s health status.
The information has continued to be available to the company, while their use will continue to be more closely controlled.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, and its effectiveness concerns only the providers of health services and insurance.
The proposal of a law which provides the authorities with the right to control and the companies that specialise in the provision of data is before the Congress.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: therefore his program developed so that data collection was linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the consent concerned can only be more difficult to open, otherwise the insurance contract will not be closed.
So, they're blind, however, just a few times shown on the list of good wills.

The European Union and India bilateral trade
As the European Union and India are inter-previous trading partners, this issue has also led to further, mainly global problems, a series of nine meetings at the highest level.
Today, the French-Indian summit will also be held, which will focus primarily on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union also recognises that India is developing with democratic power, which should be given greater opportunity to speak in international affairs, and has been unable to find a common denominator in the question of the support of the Permanent Member State of New Dilli to the UN Security Council.
This question has not yet been raised in the nine yesterday summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, co-chair of the Union, the President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed that trade would be double by five years or would increase to more than 100 billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods rose from 25 to 55 billion, the ambitious objective is not overdue.
In this respect, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been agreed by law, so green has reached future and air transport.
By the end of 2009, India and the Union were pleased to sign the Free Trade Agreement.
Sarkozy promised they'd be speeding up.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is the first trading partner in India, New Delhi represents between EU partners to nine places.
Summit also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, related to terrorism - both sides decided in all its forms and called for the rapid conclusion of the UN Conference.
They also announced the end of the Dauha business trip, although both have a major role to play in its delivery failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will remain on its energy and climate programme, while it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
It also agreed with India, as well as with the conclusion of a global agreement and the production of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the climate conference.
Both parties would also like to avoid price increases in food and support the convening of an international conference to deal with the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is today accessing the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he intends to close the trade concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that credit for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors in the value of EUR 20 billion is obtained by French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt there are more than three Italian publishers.
A large part of the Italian publishers at the International Library in Frankfurt.
More than three Italian publishers are involved in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International French Library is expected to produce more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries, who will take 171,790 square metres with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as a honorable guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural celebration in the Italian Pavilion: Italy is actually participating institutionally with the Italian Middle East (Punto Italy) – 264 metres of squarely exposed surfaces.
The meeting with the press will be held in Room Structure Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: this will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books continues to be reduced in terms of total Italian production, mainly in view of literature for children and adults.
Found by Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared on 3 September 2007, was found while traveling to Nevada.
Trosks were found on one hilltop, three thousand metres above sea level, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, within the flight, there were no human remains.
Sheriff Mader County, John Anderson, resolved the remaining errors: "The plane was found, we sent to the team and now we're sure that it's just about what Steve Fosset flew the day he disappeared," said at one press conference.
The sheriff then confirmed that no human remains were found in the airport or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old is considered to be a dead man.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the defeat, the investigator was sent to a team that finally identified the plane: one precisely about Bellanca 8kcab, not reported since 3 September 2007, when Fossett arrived from Yerington in Nevada for the third year.
Last night, still in California, near the border with Nevada, some Fossetto's personal items were found near their bays in Mommouth Lakes.
It is about two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash in cash and one unit.
The search for Fossetta was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
Billionaire got a place in history thanks to a long collection of priorities.
In 2002, at the sixth test, he became the first man to complete his journey across the world to the air balloon: two weeks on his own.
Three years later, he's covered the world in planes and without a lift.
Among his many records are also at an altitude of 15,445 metres above Andami, even with a copy.
Glk, advertising that you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and exactly defined decided lines, wide surfaces with exact lines.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "competitive" apples of the star house, which helped Mercedes-Benz try to put the news into this sector.
Its unconventional processing will be unexpected and unconventional and communication will be made available to Suv Glk on the market and will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms since 17 October next.
In this way the advertising campaign, which takes place at the start of the new vehicle's debutment, also begins informal communication through the futuristic payment campaign in 3D, which is the first to be used in Italy for the car ticket.
The Maxi Placato project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan trade class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of a car in a stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, will be possible to see a new Suv in almost real sizes and in a three-dimensional format.
In fact, when you look at the picture, you'll have the idea that the car will get out of bed.
Then, using the innovative technology Elumina8 will clear the new Glk at different moments in all its little ones so that it will be reunited in the same image.
Mercedes is certainly trying to put something new into the stereotype field of car communication with this advertising.
Will he be able to awaken the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italians are.
Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of Italy? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Nazianale assura for years and that has, in fact, never done any problems.
She's never even met a fanatical opponent.
Group orientation is legal.
The depositors are coming from Trivenet.
From Verony, Padovy, Testu and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact a small group) from Campania and Puglie were added.
They have triangular trains on which the cities of origin are present: they were removed on Saturday evening so that they would not be identified.
They're inspired by English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levský.
Figc provided 144 entries for the game: all on behalf, and thus easy to control.
And Viminale actually checked all of them: among those who went out to Sofia, there was no one with Daslem, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
The four blue fans who had earlier transitions from the stadium were prevented from entering and banned from entering the stadium.
Now Viminale is waiting to read reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then taking action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified during pregnancy.
The International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligans, soon, are not even on one stage anymore.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulation: that means more than a hundred others are added to them.
"We must quickly extinguish this fire and not justify those who act this way," they confirm with Viminal.
So, "A well-opened eye, especially because of a national explosion in the middle of Lechi."
It's just in Puglia. It's a small support core.
In the morning, Osservatorio, in the evening Casms, which can also be counted with one part of Aise, is about a secret service that deals with problems right at the stadiums.
"Church Leader and uplifting guard during Mamel hymny? It's not a crime in Bulgaria."
This is the opinion of Domenica Mazelliho (shown in a very happy way), who has been the director of the Viminal Osservatory for a few weeks (founded a place that was previously known as Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a farmer in Terst, where there is the core of the support of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It's true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it's not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course, that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is foolish.
"I am not a sociologist - the Osservatory Unit - the crimes are committed in the country in which they took place.
So far, this group has remained in the gap, and now we're looking at what happened and we're considering the future.
But let's also talk about getting up at Mamel's hymme: it's not a crime, but if you allow it, it's an incompatibility...".
