28-year-old cook in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who was recently taken to San Francisco was found in the house of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said that he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to harm him, "It's all over with him again."
Leichnam, who was found in the Westfield Mall tomorrow, was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, sharing the medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was committed as a murder and the investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Ambassador KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a cook in Boston six months ago, had bought his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
One speaker of the Sons & Daughters said that she was "scraped and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a whole family and we will miss him painfully," said the speaker.
Our thoughts and guidance are in this difficult time with Franks family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had lived in hostels for the first time, but that, "the things went up for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a friend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His nature was to connect with his family to always cook something for us to prepare for the evening," said Louis Galicia.
He did not want to take part in any kind of Auuse translation.
He was the brother who swam with the power.
"By all that the ship runs in the world, he was this unscathed diamond that shines bright every day," he said.
Anyone who has the information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD’s address under the number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I will always be buried in Schubladen
Jennifer Aniston must not always be perfect or successful.
This has made the Hollywood Star clear in an interview right now.
"I will always be buried in Schubladen or raised by outside labels, which have most to do with me and the reality."
"I don't have the desire to always be perfect and successful."
"Truely, these things are more expensive to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her being considered "Miss Perfect" as explained in the current "Cosmopolitan".
Most popularly, the actor spends his time home, in the form of a TV with a locker shower and Mexican food, it is in the magazine.
In white blood they raise the question after the childish question: "We women must not be married or have children to be perfect," said the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" Aniston is seen as a unique mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golf Longer gets the sport pyramid
His experience on the horse is remarkable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little change with an exercise on the beach.
It was a premium for 58 years.
CHIO: "Goldene Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses were remembered at their holiday home, and they were on their way to the farm.
A mile at this time, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And that's how the railways ended up again.
On Saturday, Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournaments - again in the vicinity of horses.
He and his family were guided by the ARRV plant, and he did not even move to photo targets on a horse.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and for this reason also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports help transferred the gold sports pyramids to the man from anaussen in a small Gala.
There is no need for the sympathic sporter on the drawings.
Federal Service Centre, Silvernes Lorbeerblatt, Championships-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already named him.
Longer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first priest, Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This appointment means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only for sports success but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting growth.
And that's how he also paid the price of EUR 25,000.
With 15 more outstanding sportsmen, the two U.S. master winner was added on Saturday to the "Hall of Fame of the German sport".
The highlight includes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Gienger, the daughter of Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Push and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter Michael Kolbe, Bob Faher Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the runner Alwin Schockekel and the posthumm of the handballer Erhard.
Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the Illustra Society traveled to Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza price lived.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Compare: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, both U.S. presidential competitors are involved in tax and energy policy, as well as in a principled question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, far more philosophical difference.
That's about the State's role.
Trump wants to keep the doubt small and warns how the state of the economy can be harmful - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to improve the economy to death and regulate death, he says.
On the contrary, he himself would have been completely different, accused of Trump.
He will make regulations massively back, and he makes himself strong for a comprehensive tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
On the contrary, Clinton says that the state has certain tasks to fulfil, that it has the opportunity to open and require money.
That's why the taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
They are both very close to the issue of infrastructure.
In the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost the same.
The democratic competitor even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strongly condemned by the state-critical theatre flight of the Republicans.
Thus, there could be further internal discussions on Trump.
The difference in energy and climate policy is clear.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and restore coal supply in the United States.
Oil supply should also be possible in protected areas, and the Paris climate protection agreement should be announced.
On the contrary, Clinton, with its investment programme, aims to develop renewable energy and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
However, not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, both competitors are not far away from each other.
The TPP, the transparent trade agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, both the United States and the United States do not want to isolate themselves from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better.
They should also be paid better, demands about Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hungry loan.
She wants to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage must run, then he says he should not be changed.
However, the major debate in the coming months is likely to develop more closely the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is a drop in the economy and the citizens in order to increase growth.
His critics would argue with him that the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Flight: "Each woman fled has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who fly alone, almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers access.
Four women sit in a big kitchen.
Everyone has a baby at least a year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looked curiously in the room with big eyes.
His mother gets up on the table.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She's cutting short and eating the little ones.
The scene works normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a regional business manager of Condrobs, a driver for social services in Bayern, and she works in particular with the theme of women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in Münchner North in one of the few decentralised accommodation for single women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs, together with Profamilia and Münchner, took over the establishment.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - neither as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It's not too late to say: Any woman who comes here has done on her flight experiences with sexual violence," Bahr says.
"Men fly because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they suffer or die or because their families send them to Europe as hope fighters," she says.
In women, there are other reasons for flight: "Many are secret because they don't see any other way."
In their home they have made experience of sexual violence, rape, murder, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
It's going on on the flight.
"It is not rare, for example, for a bottle of water to require sexual action," Bahr says.
And the women are the only ones who will not be protected from their families.
Who believes that it will end as soon as they arrive in Germany, Irre, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee situations would often be considered to be less valuable and abuse the worst cases.
This means that about 90 percent of the women who live in the apartment in Munich north are traumatized.
"Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created."
Many women were so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to speak openly about the experience, because the shadow is too big."
Since they often didn't want to help, more accommodations are needed only for them, Bahr demands.
In Bayern, the seven regional governments are responsible for the provision of refugees.
On the question of whether they were from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answered with no.
In the overfishing and overfishing, there is no such thing in the hands of governments.
Even in Swaben, women who have fled are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press spokesman.
In Oberbayern, sub- and central branches there are stockworks or their own houses only for independent women and their children.
The exception is low rates, there are only two central accommodation for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be treated separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be buried separately."
"If the private party or men and women are committed together, it can, more likely, be violence against women."
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study.
As women are very concerned with this protection requirement, you can take advantage of the anthrange that is available on the house in Munich.
"Since we've spoken back, we've got a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Restructuring of assistants: Requirements for new employment
The representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their cooperation to adopt new employment measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its whole Council to adopt more action on combating work since early September.
The JDC said that it was the Minister's intention to raise concerns about the contract.
Assistants and medical students have agreed in July on the termination of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was dismissed from 58% of his members who voted in favour of the elections.
In a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter last night on Thursday, the President of JDC Ellen McCart said that the government would remain "very calm" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to complete the proposed new contract and to call for formal negotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's request today, the Board of Directors of the JDC made a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve an ongoing programme of scaling work-related measures beginning in September.
The conflicts led to the six times this year’s assistant doctors, the first outbreaks in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA assistant doctor, Dr. Johann Malavanawana, is returning after the election to cancel the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He shared with BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, with the view that the contract should benefit and be adopted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: A Alliance of Foreigners?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight months of the war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent at the famous St. Petersburg Palace Hall in reception, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this promotion most.
It gave me the handcuff, yes.
But Putin's legs acted gently, and he hardly threw out the heat, even for his remaining relationships.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke again from his "loved friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to its old level before the crisis, but will even be improved.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had adopted himself as if something had never happened.
I thought his enthusiastism was the opposite.
But one of Putin's exciting, sustainable colds showed that the Russian government chief had not forgotten anything.
More often the cause of the crisis was what he mentioned in his introduction words: the decision of a Russian fighter on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moskaus' reaction to the time was quite burnt.
Putin shared out and charged Ankara to be in the back of Russia.
The move was even greater, since it was started by a friend who was a relative.
It is difficult to rebuild the vetra if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has been changing since November.
For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
On one occasion it seemed as if the Turks would bear all the blame.
Most seriously, the charges of leading officials were that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria, which was controlled by the so-called Islamic state.
He's been fighting this thing.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message sounded that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to sell a sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a gun stand are clear.
Erdogan first needs all the friends he can get after the last month in a state-of-the-fashioned state-run.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also attacked him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have touched Turkey's heart - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number was almost 90 %.
Travellers and charter companies in Russia will be facilitated when the flights are re-arranged.
They count on a late-on-one storm on the Mediterranean.
This week, the state supply forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated the following: "Tourists there long, tomatoes long here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, since it considers its reaction to the attempt to take power as a weak response.
To this end, the continuing Groll on the cut-off period of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which aims to take advantage of the cold vote and reduce Turkey's relationship to the west.
The Russian Head of State in Ankara has certainly won a bonus in order to request support for the elected state bodies after the attempt.
This is well-known for Moscow, a self-consciousness that even has a profound fear of change in regimes.
The summit in this beautiful palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an analytic first to me, "A Alliance of Foreigners": two countries that were confused and treated badly and now connected.
Nevertheless, despite the public deficit, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It may be noted that, after almost three hours of initial talks, both Presidents at the press conference said they had never discussed the subject.
The President of Turkey apparently refused to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.
There is no clear consensus on where a common speaker can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when the NATO member of Turkey takes over the Russian conflict - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS mark should be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's head.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the bank has distanced itself when it had to be calibrated almost eight years ago and saved.
At this time, brand strategies "RBS" have been used to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of funds on sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Victory Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to turn more national brands into the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be started.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentral headquarters and the birth note are changed to NatWest.
The Mark Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will become more important - Côtets, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will be on our investment brand and on the brand that our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we're not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the reality of the different brands in its sport sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop ourselves into the bank of the brands, because how do we concentrate on making this a better bank for customers?" said the president.
It would have been very interesting three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and had launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these marks again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000 winnings at Newmarket
Dettori prompts Champagner after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000 wins
The Jocky Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000 British winnings on Friday at Newmarket.
He set a milestone on his local racetrack with his second win in the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flatline.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
The dramatic winner Dettori, who won on Ghyyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I've been here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a banana holiday night with 20,000 people.
I'm easy and very clear.
Dettori takes up the Jubel when he holds the victory on Predlection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the barrier race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-man winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-year-old Derbysier had 4,493 careers
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the moderns and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that has just arrived before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intelligence that separates him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a great messenger for race, his enthusiastism and charisma who has been inspired by fans for years for this kind of sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and a big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been healing in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but besides, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the reflection of the British fleet for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glorrich Sevens" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six - month - old spring, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to support his two daughters and return to his best form.
And he's not yet at the end - Dettori has once said that he wants to continue in competition until his 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fires chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly left his deputy chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was one of Putin's greatest trusts for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kremlin, Putin stated that without giving reasons, "the release of Ivanovs has been ordered by his duties as president of the Russian Presidial Administration".
Anton Vaino, who has been a representative of Ivanov since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he finished his studies at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the field in Tokyo.
On the Kreml website, it (in Russian) means that he was later the Head of Protocol and Head of Staff of the Government.
Of his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the Government to support your work as a Head of State in the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV sender on Friday that Ivanov had prayed to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his followers.
Do you trust the ridiculous faces?
This step has made Moscow a secret weapon.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the most trusted Vladimir Putins for a long time and worked as he worked for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was released on the television, two men claimed that the Chief of Staff would return to his own will.
However, despite the level of the camera, there are only a few of these - especially now, shortly before Parliament's elections.
So here's the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows now.
But the official opinion - that a man who was first elected as a potential president, once wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - stood on a large scale.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "it is true that I have prayed to you in a conversation in early 2012 for these very complicated posts - you could almost say - to trust difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been the president of the Russian Presidy Board for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
He was the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
As Putin reached power, he declared Ivanov to be one of five people he trusted most.
It was first accepted that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of office Putins had failed the Constitution.
But these posts were taken by another, nearby bound Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became a Prime Minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson burned after killing producers
Gibson was involved last month in a physical replacement at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its rejection in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly charged himself on Thursday before his announcement.
In the set it came to artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I'm counting on the case," he said in a message.
Details of how the character of Gibsons from the series, followed by a team of FBI agents, is expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who played at the Sitcom Dharma & Greg since the first stage of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've been covering my entire heart for the last twelve years," said Gibson in a message published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but it will not be possible now.
I would simply like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful Crew and especially the best fans that can only wish for a series.
The planned extraction of the twelve stacks is scheduled on 28 September.
Fishing routes in Banff’s gardens
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish, who appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks it could be done at the 75-fishes around the Sandale that were fired by a spring.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two long-distance fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Brace now connected to Fife
The €1,35 billion thine project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing with the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four resolutions of the "covered glass" that will draw closer to each of the three doors of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has more than 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 pieces of steel.
The €1,35 billion thine project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown took a visit today and was one of the first to get from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly Ethiopian scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the Viadukt and the bridge deck is a serious activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passage.
In total, nearly 79% of the entire bridge decks at its site and the last section of the deck are today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge at its site.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first conclusion of each bridge project is a major milestone.
In this fantastic project, the conclusion is a future high and deep building.
After the installation of the last road section and its connection to the North Tower deck in development, we had to close the existing gaps on the north or the land side.
This was achieved by drawings of the northern porter bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very difficult work.
Massive, since the Viadukt is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tonnes are measured and had to be taken up by a rise of about 3 %.
Heikkel, since the tolerances on which the team is working were winzig - on each side they refer only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything was very good.
Salvation in the Moelfrey Bay: Three Men Have "Happy to Be Still in Life"
Three men have "happy to be alive" after being shot by their fishing boat before England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station ran on Friday at 13:20 BST Alarm, after a Crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty sleeping safely while her boat continued to move out of its own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around and put our worst," said the leader of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
" Luckily, the strong wind has already pushed the boat out of its richness until we put it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat while the third man was created at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boje without a rescue boat.
They all arrived on board the coastal repair boat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water have been happy to be alive.
The boat engine, however, had a nocturnal light, but the boat was released at the center of the boat by the person who controlled the boat.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Severely damaged - a man hangs on his ex-Freundin
A man attacked his ex-Freundin in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-olds had obtained the keys to their apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholics cut off the clothes of their ex-freundin.
When this came into the apartment, he got on it twice.
The 44-year-olds were injured by hand and body.
The police could catch the killer.
During the 1950s, his ex-Freundin's clothes broke, he called his mother.
This alarmed his sister.
Together with their survivors, the 45-year-olds wanted to slow down their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her survivors.
On the street they face the man's ex-life threat.
When the two women re-examined the apartment, the 50-year-old took his sister to the side and grabbed his ex-boyfriend.
Who makes Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens mean: investors are going to be much stronger in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 valuable dwellings in the coming years?
The SPD proposes a "handling concept" for the next meeting.
But the race is programmed.
Firstly, it is about the question: Who really should build the cheap apartments?
A scheme is already in progress.
SPD Group President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: Anyone who wants to build on urban areas needs to show 20 per cent of all dwellings as social housing in the future."
However, the comfortable apartments can also be found in the stock.
However, the big point in the Rathaus is: "How are you going with investors who want to build in private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent of these areas, but at least 20 per cent of the dwellings are built as social housing."
A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and have to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, as Brother said, "there is still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.
The link will still want hard jobs for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann experienced a deterioration of the situation on the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will be provided for additional tasks in the building management.
More personnel will be needed.
It's not clear whether we'll get the experts.
However, the programme is still not complete: for the about 1260 new apartments that should be built without any delay.
But how do you compare the loss of about 1300 other valuable apartments, whose promotion will be launched in the coming years?
Only by 2020 there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning political speaker Nicole Palm should now buy running connections from the city.
In addition, it had to be considered to restore dwellings to the price chain.
That's possible in the West City.
The problem was solved on one side.
Because in the West city, they run for years.
About 1800 apartments could be found back there in the price combination for cheap apartments.
It's just that the owners don't want the housing companies.
Because the number of social housing in the West will again be dramatically increased, one will be removed from the purpose of the so-called migration.
A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city should no longer be given.
The reasons are due to the fact that there is still movement in the discussion.
Group president Holger Herlitschke says: "For a large majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
However, they have focused on more construction sites for single families.
What does not mean, however, is that no compromise can be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness that wins
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to starve on screens, has been regretted by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is therefore going to get people from the sofa and become more active.
The time on the screen was first on the TV, then on video games and finally on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities in the free environment are not excluded from each other.
I am of course referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of drawings, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture gave interest before the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand began July.
The market introduction in other countries was moved by the massive demand that the server overloaded.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photografted" (on a screenshot on the phone) or "caught".
A generation that played the game when she was younger, closed the wagon and ran for the Sofa search.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that restores the "medium" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, told Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people who follow each day who practice 30 minutes requires 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go – it just sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to bring to it "six 30 minutes to take time," "from Sofa" and "to be active every day" stood on the grass ears, because many public messages about health are long-term and come from people who look breathy.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who pursue regular sports reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to bring them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.
This covers three spheres of health - movement, fresh air and sunglasses, as well as fun.
Some people even end up having new friends on the hunt.
As is always the case with Morish players who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What are you gonna do?
It's got a break.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had been able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.
The new will lose its journey and the use will be postponed in time.
Because of Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games to combine the apps and virtual reality with the active values in the real world and to help many people to be more active, more active and sound.

Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies' rooms
Forget the print.
Forget the hip.
Simone Billes is immune to all of this.
Dynamicly on the spring horse.
It's impossible on the bar.
It's amazing on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now the Olympics.
The 19-year-old American tournament ended on Thursday for the multi-fighting title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the shadow of the Olympics.
Her total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and the "Final Five" Men's Cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women, Simone Biles, turn on the swimming pool during the single-month battle of women in the art tournaments at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Billes is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-fighting title and all five as she determines her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She came out in trains when her outcome was shown and her long journey was finally over.
This success puts in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Billes has dominated her sport for the last three years, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of honour and precision that the 1984 Olympics Mary Lou Retton from her said that she was "the best tournament I've ever seen."
It expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so far between the cars and the rest of the athletes, but much more between you and a lot of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful gold would be viewed as a disappointment.
The American women, Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, became upset after they won each gold and silver in the women's solo match finals at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Bills held the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the day of the separation of the retired male coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Bills were on it, while their long way to the peaks never planned for the future, that is not true.
A part of their underground circuits, which include their typical tumbling pass, is based on Latin American music, which would fit home on the street outside of the Olympics in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament, was trained in the Boorman.
Since summer 2013, she has lost no more multi-fighting competition, a victory series that will be held as long as Billes wants.
Even if Mustafina was easily led by two drawings, the picture was taken away.
Swimming bars and basements - in which cars hold the title of the world master.
She re-entered with 15,433 on the Swiss side and put another one on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman greeted her kindly when she expected her end result - a pure formality and tears flowed on billboards glowing red, white and blue Eyeliner, as the vision she first described in her collection book came true.
The performance of Raismans was a race for the last time four years ago when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old mannskatian, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a predominance.
After her subjugation, she went to the public Kosshende, overcome by a comeback, which sometimes appeared twice.
As for Billes, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19th year of the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 shots in serial murder at the sound of music in the car
According to police officers who were released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks they've had since a decade in the first serial murder of Phoenix while they were in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughters Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a parking lot, the authorities said.
The manufacturer fires eight shots from a gun, while standing on the driver’s side of the car and flying along with another vehicle, is to read in the report.
The police reported that the three-fold murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the cash or $2,900 that belonged to one of the adult victims.
The police speaker from Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooters trained the investigators to become a closer look at whether they were related to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed in Spanish residential areas within four months in nine attacks and two more were injured.
"It happens in a residential area before a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is accepted that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were related and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah are still dying in front of the scene.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shootings, which was about half an hour before the three-fold murder, and it will be concluded that it was the work of the serial killer.
They found patterns and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalie: "It's gonna be better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves the songs, toys and his mother, of course.
But as the least of his peers, Edmund Mikrozephalie, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, it was my first thought, I didn't.
I can't do that.
I didn't get involved in this.
What doesn't agree -- of course you've got to get involved in it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund would never be able to recognize them under circumstances and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first answer to this was 'I didn't know that the people were still doing it,' explained Picciuto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund could not sit still until his third year of life and he can't speak yet.
But he's making slow progress.
He can run with support and drive.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund was expecting for "Please sing something ahead of me."
"We bring him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund has found some characters alone.
Microzephalia has a number of causes: genetics such as Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as Maserne or Zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Piccito remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going on?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time since I didn't expect it to be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has a promising cure for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It'll be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfalls, overwhelming is allowed for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfalls and massive flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to issue the emergency on Friday. It will be counted the whole Saturday with more rainfalls.
Many rivers in the south of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi crossed their shores and swirled with large-scale overflows after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already in the process of helping the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, shared that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangapahoa had requested tens of thousands of sandwiches.
An overheating warning system is used in many parts of the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service allowed additional 3 to 5 tonnes to fall on rivers in this area.
In southern Alabama, a river early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to be reported in the mobile area.
The river Comité near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, which are both located in Louisiana, will reach all probability after the weekly record trail.
The meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that the two rivers could supersede many houses in the area near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a stromaching overflow in Ascension Parish represents a risk, as these flows are only gradually flowed into the Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest point of 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams still found people from the river in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwestern part of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepchildren were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the water from Beaver Creek, which normally lies more than 400 feet away from his house, increased greatly over the night.
He said he had been warned by another stif son who lived nearby.
"We're up and the water flowed and flowed here," said Hansford.
It's been my turn.
His wife, Hansford, said that she had never seen such a height of the river in the 48 years in which she lived.
Hansford said he and his family had all the obstacles and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military LKW and had brought them to the next firefight in Gloster, where they were delivered until Friday.
Krautmann said that the overwhelming had "fast spread" because there were still severe rainfalls and that the authorities were taking into account the instructions for evaluation.
According to Krautmann, a visitor in the vicinity of Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 customs rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly damaged by rainfalls since midnight.
The authorities pointed out that severe rainfalls and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangapahoa Parish and education in five schools.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an addendum network in Tangapahoa 200 overheated homes.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which now were both overwhelmed.
The president of the municipality, Robby Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven households who were hit by high water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the Evacuators.
"If the water begins to return, they will be able to return to their homes again," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the town of Tangapahoa, almost two thousand roads were closed because of the high water, and sand sacs were provided for the residents to take in, hoping to keep the water from their houses and businesses.
"The last major overwhelming we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said it was still on the golf course.
According to his comments, a full house on Thursday should be reported as overcrowded, but on Friday no one has been reported so far.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "through the hills", lives skiing in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was attacked in Philadelphia this week is already the second time a 6-year-old child is attacked.
The boys' grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The elders explained that Brown had suffered several strokes, including in the country, legs, arms and bow, but that he had been in the hospital at the time of his transport.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was overcome by bullets," said his grandmother Delores Mendez to the sender.
I just can't believe it.
The boy’s condition was critically established in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the messenger that he was expected to be welcomed back.
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were arrested in Germanytown.
There were also three men: two in 29 years of age and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The young man was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical state, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police found out if they could be among one of the wounded men.
Meanwhile, CBS Philadelphia shared that it seems to have come to a crossfire between several shields.
The tatort is transferred to the tatort by pattern for storm waves that have been subjected to different storm waves.
There seems to have been a clear conflict in this regard.
On the street, on both sides of the force, there are hills.
This seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active," said police officer Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the sender.
Several houses and vehicles were also found in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking reports following the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cheerleader on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She gets up and the police are looking for another suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I'm suggesting under the women's lympia in the tournament, and that's for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been so dominant since 1984 at every summer Olympics, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this man has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which have inspired other skin colors for many young girls.
The structure of this man, the Aly Raisman, the Jew, and Madison Kocian, the Catholic, is shining, makes everyone proud.
This man finally reflects the United States.
It has confirmed the black and Hispanic female presence at the tip of this sport.
In the last four years, the number was one of the female tournaments.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and 2.2.
That shows strength.
During the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a wonderful Olympic winner and a young American.
Now the world was in a position to be witness to the incredible performance of the three world teachers Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but most of them delivered Gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won in an individual multi-fighting event for women gold.
Aly Raisman, a member of the crew, won Silver.
We experience the tips of this kind of sport, but that's not how the tour classes in the whole country look.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all run the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into an Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the man. Besides, this is the last year with Martha Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality seems to be that tournaments are a great sport and tournaments are first held in private tournaments, which are maintained by parents, which are held up for training, installation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their tournaments and families). The list can continue anyway.
The majority of these tournaments are in prosperous conditions that can support the business.
In this union, the tournament will receive all its training and this is a loving and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the tournaments.
We need to enable the communities, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to be more easily accessible and accessible.
I've been building my tournament for 20 years.
In my events, we have offered free and flexible tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the young high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from these great Olympic sports.
Towers develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers long-term benefits for health and for academic and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this man to bring thousands of young girls to take an interest in the tournaments and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
That's such a exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for this real expression of "Girl Power" through the Hole of the Olympic Men's Gold and thanks, you are encouraging so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize further strike after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Minister had hoped that the dispute would end by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in favour of the election.
In July, Hunt Plane insisted that the contract be enforced and said that the NHS was in a "NEU country" and that any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistants are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and week work to improve their care for unnecessary times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistive Medicines, said last night in a communication: "Auxiliaries have been given the proposed contract in the form of serious thoughts, in particular that it will join the current crisis and it will be forced to treat all doctors correctly."
In just eight weeks, which remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by means of talks have been made to participate in the government's return and sometimes on unfavourable weaknesses.
This was the case of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made in the last month that his door would always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, raise the tension and respond to the care of the assistants."
If he does not, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to take further action to combat work.
The last strike at the end of April saw an increase of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 terms, since sick sisters and professionals were involved in providing doctors with coverage on the strike chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute on the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend loan for 54,000 assistants subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, asked the assistants to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Employment measures are not only small but are already overloaded teams and service providers and are prepared for patients, nurses and their families only to worry, need and break."
In the last two months, we have talked to the Committee of the Assistive Medicines and spoke to the Ministry of Health as well as to other ministers positively on the concerns of the prevention and management.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those who returned from a professional period, training costs, mutual recognition of the teaching plan, continuing training leave and gender-specific pay in medicine - was a sign of how serious was the employer, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce the risk of heart rate
Thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £2 per day medicine after being advised by the authorities to use this more people for a longer period of time.
The withdrawal medication Ticagrel reduces the risk of repeated heart rate for people with a heart disease.
The medicine is already taken 12 months after a heart attack which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS's NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year adoption to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS's NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year adoption to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 120,000 people experience a heart attack every year and a quarter of it experience another heart attack or a stroke.
Cardiovascular disorders and strokes are caused by collections of fatty materials in the arterial walls that form the premises.
If the seizure is severe, it may cause a blood clot that prevents the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.
When the blood vessels are dissolved, they can flow through the blood stream and hide the flow of blood into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack are at greater risk of having another one.
Ticagrel, produced by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilice, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood vessels unlikely.
The NICE manual, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrel followed by 60mg with a double daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In spite of the availability of secondary prevention, there are a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack, another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart rate can have a major negative effect on the quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrel in combination with Aspirin is effective in reducing other heart problems and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.
Through a provisional recommendation from Ticagrel, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrel - in particular the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
The culture of Political Correctness allows elections to flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the office last year by a government report on corruption
A culture of the Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral corruption in Muslim communities is significantly ignored as a devastating government report has been published today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles wishes to speak to the police, electors and councillors to ignore evidence of election abuse due to "incompatibilities with regard to Ethnie and Religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Community Government, who is now a king of anti-corruption, said that it would be so bad for the arrest of voters for religious reasons that the police should be allowed to establish barriers outside electoral cabinets to protect protected voters.
He recommends that voters take a look at themselves in order to prove their identity when they choose.
In time, a elector must only name his name and address.
The report suggests not to put extraterritorial ink on a person's finger when they give their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the press to have more access to joint statements and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This does not only serve against elections, but also the municipal government should protect against the wider corruption and financial exploitation culture, which leads to this," he said.
The report was organized by the Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election in eastern London.
Last year a special election court decided that the official mayor of Lutfur Rahman, after a Lithuanian, should be subjected to corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had converted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "synically and in a way" and that he had brought his critics to Switzerland with racist and Islamic charges.
Rahman should have "leaded his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either double or the result of a move, with one person choosing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
In particular, he was alarming about the negative writing failure - with the older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice.
Sir Eric, formed, made several recommendations to overcome the electoral system, including the leadership of evidence to prove identity
In his report it says: "It has been shown that pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities has been exercised, particularly women and young people, in order to select, according to the will of the elderly, particularly communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"It was thought that... state institutions had clearly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" perceptions regarding Ethnies and Religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to overcome the system, including the ban on the processing of political activists' patents to stop "valuing".
The report taken into account by Theresa May also requires further registration checks to prevent the use of the list of options for immigration and social production.
Take note of options to ask the voters before the selection after your statement.
No remote ink on a person's finger, as soon as she gave her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter error.
It is prohibited that political activists make complete written mistakes and make changes in written errors.
The police have the authority to set up suspensions for election stations.
A legislative amendment which facilitates an appeal for asylum under the representative of the People Act 1983.
Photographer ban in electoral stations.
A requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).
Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees apply the rule that the voters only go to the electoral office.
Sir Eric falls across the Metropolitan Police and finds it "extremely", that after the Tower Hamlets case, no penalty has been imposed.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his representative responsible for corrupt and illegal practices in view of a litany," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal procedure - for sufficient reasons.
It also criticises the unimpacted "back controls" of the electoral offices of the councillors.
Sir Eric said: "The Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets has been a warning signal since last year.
Our country as the mother of Parliament is a noble heritage, but the worrying and covered distribution of elections and the neglect of some authorities jeopardise this good call.
Delayed by Kates Radler double racer and other famous Olympic runners in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have spent this week on the French runner Pauline Ferrand-Prevot outside the range and band, which has proved to be an impressive double player of Cambridge's heart.
But the 24-year-old Olympics is not the only one to fight for gold, which has its own famous double players - at least not if you can give the social media faith.
To honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fling at the time on our screens, F.
The Jäger and the Wolf: a man member of the U.S. Man in the Bogenschichteen Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
In addition to Kate's double race train, many people on the Internet showed how a certain bong protection could be the twinning of A-promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. Mansion member in the Bogenschichteen, Brady Ellison, has caused an attack on Twitter, following images he sees relatively similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the bourgeoisie managed to drive into the social media and added that he had already heard from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see any great similarity, except for facial storage," told Brady of Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm gonna make it a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt take place this year in the middle of the year: the striking similarity between the British extender Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with its large, expressive eyes should be able to run as a double player for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African Swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user is the view that Nathan is the "athlete version" of the inception player
A further enduring comparison was drawn between Tennisstar Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, similar to heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-burned skin and blue hair like the actor Annalyn McCord, while American Nathan Adrian of Fans was certified to match a "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong Women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter Player Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only thing: A Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others have also suffered from similar reactions.
Theory Set in the Room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple's similarity
A Twitter user stated her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter have an incredible face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh jennings and her relatives, who are almost identical to the actor Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the tournament, Gabby Douglas, who features her own beautiful, wide ranks, similar to that of bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.

Byron MacDonalds Analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m Free-Smokers at the CBC Live Transfer of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian CBC sender had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese skimmer was "like a dream" and during the race as "a woman died".
Commentary Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave up his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-of-charge table.
MacDonald, who was held in the CBS's comment team on board to give more "color", could say, "This 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Upstairs, went out like a dream, died like a woman.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese Swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, dropped the second stage of the swimming pool 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds longer than Canada Taylor Ruck, which enabled the Canadians to close the holes in China.
Visitors throughout Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the tone and language
Emmet Macfarlane second, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old skimmer from China "as a woman died"?????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still sending."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-of-charge table for women as follows: "This 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many talking to him.
Twitter users didn't stand back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who updated the CBC's message, came alive for MacDonald's comment and said, "We are sorry that the comment was made about a skiing performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it's happened."
CBC was finally accused of more than 90 times in the people who responded to the comment on Twitter.
Co-ordinator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about the comments of MacDonald
The network also apologized quickly and sent a message out.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to be published.
Last night, we were quickly accused of sending our visitors and our followers to the social media.
To clarify, Byrons comments are about the performance of the swimming pool and not about it as a person.
However, they were inadequate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron does what he said, very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald decided to send and tried to correct his comments by saying that it was not his intention that she should be subjected to personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to excuse myself for the comment I made after the female discharge in the CBC Olympics, he said.
"I've been on the service of the Swimmer and not on them as a person."
Of course, there was no misunderstanding and I'm sorry."
Buyers in Primark are about a woman who is tested in the middle of a business free of charge
The buyers did not know where they should look when a woman dressed in a primordial dress to try underhouses.
To make the situation worse, she had to take her way out of it, pull her out and put her back into the rule.
She also stopped and tried four pairs of subhosens in a business in Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Volkestone, on.
The Primark Business in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Volkestone, where the woman approved the Underhoses before she returned to the rule
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in business, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underdressing, "she went back and left the business without anything to buy."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sale, she took a couple of underhospitations from the exhibit, took out her own stormhouses and hoses and tested them.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place to do it - she just stood there, like Oskar."
"Every man stood up when they pulled out the underhospitable things that apparently didn't fall because they put them back into the rule."
She continued the same with three more underhospitations before she finally decided that she didn't miss anything, sneezed again and disappeared.
"They didn't seem to disturb that they noticed - or think about the person who would buy the underhouses under circumstances that they had approved."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How foolish to think that someone would take underhouses with someone else who would have seen another person and not been washed."
The event arrived on Tuesday.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I arrived, the employees tried to remove the clothing parts from the sale after she left - what was really good."
"I'd like to go home with a new couple of underhospitables and find out that another woman saw her and took her out again and they weren't washed."
A speaker from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, 9 August in our branch in Volkstone."
All the products concerned were taken from the sale.
How to protect yourself from armed assaults with Krav Maga
The world out there is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it safer for you.
We speak with Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga League in New York, to find out how you are surrounded by armed thieves on a close-up.
Whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you turn the floor for your driver.
If you are bitten from the back, then you should turn first so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the closet," says Mizrachi.
Then get the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free Elbogen face.
Scream him with the neck into the neck and shake him, while the attacker bows down before pain, the weapon comes out of his hands. Slap him with his face, and move back as they turn the weapon on him.
In the case of attackers who are approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shell line, get the gun and destroy it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, lower the weight of the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then pull the weapon out of his grip before moving back and pointing the weapon at him.
Does it sound hard?
Watch the video to see exactly how it shapes Mirzrachi.
But think it's the safest thing to spend your money on a robbery - if you're not a krav Maga master.
Traveler Ian Wright creates his voice for a tour guide at the hottest places of Europe
A British traveler undertook his immune system and virgerflex a serious test - enabling some of Europe’s most slums and epheasant places.
The Moderator and Traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, created his trains on a Euro scale, a country at Piccadily Circus, a train-to-citizen button and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before viewing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to allow.
But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Intern Strength" brought some surprising results today.
The thought of cutting off the tip of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely remote, but there are actually more bad bacteria in a kitchen floor.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical authorities about the promotion of dentists and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left him, more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his dreams by traveling through the world with his own and wonderful things.
From public countries on railway stations to trailers, the task of its immune system was finalised under a test.
In the film, he said, "I was already a child relatively unafraid about my health and I buried all the things I could in my mouth, Earth, Wurmer and Slamm water."
In the film, he was executed on every case.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His probationary test showed a luminometer of more than 4,000 units.
In contrast, the number of luminometers is less than 60 freshly washed hands.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to decline after viewing her luminometer number over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner String", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
In the film he says, "This is the worst thing I've ever done in a toilet."
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not going to let anything go here because it's stuck inside here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Intern Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company replaces Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains milk sugar bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to support the promotion of dermatitis and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Seeds and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.
We led crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let us call Ian."
They claimed that the interest in poor health would become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of dry health and how it is related to the immune system.
The growing interest in dry health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's government, added: "Let me tell you so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had eaten some of the things I showed him, like the ecstatic Russian toilets that are shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian into this, to pick them up, and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we took some of these dirty toys on film."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of all polled milk sugar bacteria, in particular with the benefit of magen and Darm and 58 per cent, said that they used at least occasionally products containing added milk sugar bacteria.
Asiole family destroyed before delogation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An associative family lost their social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeledon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were filed after a long list of complaints about their presence in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their presence, shocked members of the housing society found their property in an unreparable condition.
The walls showed striking holes, wooden sections were raised, müll was spread on the floor and graphiti was measured on the walls.
The family was surrounded and it is accepted that she now lives in a private home
Donna McEvoy, who works for the household administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said: "There was an absolute album for the people here, and I see that people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to take into account, since this property may be seen as not as beautiful as part of Cornwalls.
The family is famous and her call is also true.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment at the time, and the police said that the terror that had accompanied the family included street fights with baseball players, kidnappers from residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive theft, wars and flights.
Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the rent contract, was granted an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house that will be removed under circumstances, old furniture was found
It was in the presence in which drugs were used in the past, which raised the wood parts.
Neighbors said they had to see them fighting on the street and they had to call the police regularly.
Cornwall Hausing gave her and her partner this week violently out of existence after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to free.
The delogation was doubled by simplified neighbors who said that her life was made for hell.
One said, "They didn't worry about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We stopped because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now, where they're finally gone, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, nearbourwood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Hausing, said it would have been the family's intention to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were regularly called, 20 years ago
On the overcrowded side of the community house, furniture and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the renter has been denied any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, since a delegation is always the last step the Cornwall Housing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case, since the conduct was extremely extreme and their actions had to be carefully faulted for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall and members of the community have done and have let us know.
I hope that this development will be spent by some neighbours and the message is that antisocial attitudes will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house for a different time, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty matrice left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the ground
Home management workers will now have to remove müllberges that surround the house
In 2014, the police led a Razzia into the house and found over 70g Cannabis as well as waagen, paraphernalia and barge in heights of £1.700.
Skeldon received a fine after he had been convicted of possession of a drug of Class B.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who came to life in 2013.
After they were unobdicted, Tanya and her partner will now live in a private apartment in Plymouth.
Many rooms in the house were decorated with graffiti.
The police say that they will be delegated by tenants who do not adhere to the rules of the house.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall's police told me that the delegation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the rules.
"This applies to those who think they can do without their own preferences and to those who have been hurt by such a behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to cooperate with partners in order to protect our communities.
Travellers in Portugal in Panik after moving a deep military jet beach
Solarists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force Airport
Air combat forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but they needed no safety risk.
This was the moment to start in panic in the busy tourist resort, after a deep-fashioned jet ran down a full beach.
Dramatic video captures showed how the military aircraft was almost able to approach the solar crews on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The runners wake up when they clearly begin to worry about the heat of the divers without first seeing what happens to them through the clouds.
The event happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many runners who posted videos on the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "Flag is twice too deep, and there was a moment when it looked as if it would break."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just on the surface and it felt like the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of darkness and incredibly deep flow
The Portuguese air force today announced that the P-3C Orion aircraft pilot was on a train to identify fishing boats at the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only possibility to recognize them.
The speaker said that the jet, due to the bad visual conditions, was a little deeper than the usual flu, but the air force needed to ensure that safety was not threatened at any time.
This summer fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese party, where four people on the island of Madeira have also been killed.
The Portuguese air force today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - stronger Nebel and Brandrauch - which limited his view.
The aircraft was on a train that had to be identified by the pilot fishing boat as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Seville
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first time in the new football season.
The Catalans are in duel around the Spanish Supercup on the opposite side of the FC Seville, the return game will rise three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must, in a powerful match with the subsidised Cupfinists and the European League champion, among others on Neymar, who is fighting the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing from the streets.
In training, the German experienced a banding in the neck, where the inquiry at Barca was first clarified by Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and Ter walks have been in Barcelona for two years about the status as a number.
Coach Luis Enrique thus far failed to make a clear decision, and Bravo left the League, but Ter's step in most of the other competitions.
Before the first game of the new game, there is doubt at the Spanish master about the fitness status of the man who was demoted on Saturday in a Liverpool test game with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the trial case against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really believe it.
Again, Seville has the 2:3 degree of delay after enlargement in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is fighting the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona's record winner has been successful in this competition until now.
Ma Long in a own league to silver gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Tischennis Olympic player.
The 27-year-old was visited on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a unique finale of his countryman and "title protector" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4).
This led to the first world-class "Gold Grand Slam" with success at WM, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and even Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have created it as expected in the final game and have become the title of each other.
Thus it was clear that the third time a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympics was former Swiss-NÖ legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the plate, between the seats and time out they had no coaches.
They had returned to the tribune and left their defenders alone in the war.
"The matches I've played for my country until here."
"In the end I play for me," Zhang had rightly said.
After the party, gold and silver medallion winner with the Chinese fan.
The match itself was unexpected.
Ma had only to fight with his 28-year-old opponent in the first sentence.
Then he determined the time on the disk and left Zhang there only 13 points in total.
Through Ma's over-reliance, the expected match did not develop.
However, they were not to be seen in a rather impressive way.
Mizutani won the game on Bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his fourth final against the German European mayor Dimitry Ovtcharov, the white Russian had been subjected to a seizure, then was in medical treatment, and had to be satisfied with blech.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) were in relatively high Tischennisalter Olympics.
Donald Trump deals with "normal problems" in the election struggle
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is subject to massive concerns, including in traditional conservative federal states.
The presidential candidate Donald Trump was now weak in his election campaign in the former Republican Highburg Utah.
A rare moment, in which the normally great and self-sacrifice multibillionaire, who appeared, reported something like thoughts, as correspondents reported.
After he pulled 16 rivals from his own Republican camp out of the race, the doubts now grew about his success in the fight against the white house.
"We have serious problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians, who sought support in important federal states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Should there be false reports about his candidate, he took back his famous media sources.
Watch Republican Highsburgs
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Republicans.
A survey by SurveyUSA from June followed by Trup and his competitor of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutions, however, do not see the extent to which they are common to Republican candidates in the Federal State.
As a threat, Arizona and Georgia are also affected.
In an interview by the CNBC sender, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the premarsch Clintons again: "As well as I have done it so far."
And create later: this will either "be successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long holiday".
He's not doing anything but telling the truth.
If it is not enough for him at the end of the political correction, it is all right, Trup said further.
Then I go back to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party should have threatened to raise money to support its election campaign, and it should not be able to present any better interviewees.
On the contrary, it is the desire to strengthen the candidate countries for the Congress.
Olympia: Drying performance at Doping Test
The IOC wants to establish a Disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenya's Leichtalläten was awarded the second Doping Fair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemeach.
After a survey at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee agreed to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan operative had reported that the former Sprinter and current Coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village, had issued an urn sample on the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This has been reported by the Kenyas team leader of the Doping Controllers.
The IAAF World Federation has requested IOC to investigate the case, with an IAAF speaker.
"In the light of the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IOC, the IAAF will be assessed," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and published himself as Ferguson Rotich, who gave the test and signed it," Kenyas Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was in the Accreditation of the athletes who were on the training board of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was born in 2015 in Beijing WM-Vierter over 800 metres.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Leichtalletics Delegation Chief Michael Rotich was removed from the Rio games.
He should have informed the sportsmen of his country's outstanding Doping Tests against cash payments.
As a result, media reports should be taken on his return to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation in the IOC for a long time after many doping processes.
In the announcement of the IOC more than 2000 doping target controls in front of the Rio games, it was unusual to indicate that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be admitted to the audience.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-Doping gesture and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, the WADA Kenya adopted the list of countries whose doping fight is in accordance with the WADA rules.
Kenya looks like a big runner-nation.
The country's lighthouses won most of the medals at the 2015 WM in Beijing.
In a number of ARD television reports, there has been repeated claims that Kenya's Doping media are easily accessible and that there should be a significant mentality of the sports record.
IOC member Richard Pound asked for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had commissioned it in the Russian literature.
This could prove that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically baptized.
In addition, Russian leagues were excluded from summer games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, like Romeo and Julia.
With that, a wonderful Cecilia Bartoli.
A Musical hijacked Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's Masterwork.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the music into the temple of the classical and filled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchester led by the Venezuelan director Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of Rhythmus", he laments.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their time and their melody.
It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this insensitivity, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers with affection her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
Maria's role has always fascinated me.
First because she's musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright."
So she's smart, of course she's naive, and very sad.
"It looks very much like me, my Italian character, which I have as a novelist," said Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecelia is a wonderful artist."
It's such a honor to work with her.
She's an unremembered great man.
And Bartoli repeats the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very sympathetic!"
Directing is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his views, it's his life!
It is such a great opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperature, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is certainly very important!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly timely: "In this piece it is about advantages and fantasy."
Today we have the refugees, the Puerto Ricans have gone to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as strong today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London students who joined the IS were killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British students who last year left London to join the IS, died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family had experienced a few weeks before her death in Raqqh, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqq, the ballwork of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she was planning to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"I can only hope that the only good is in it - as a meal and a warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people stop making this decision every time," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other students from eastern London flew into a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultanas family was informed that she married an ISIS warrior in Syria - and within a few months she became a white man.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election in Garland.
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will be nominated by Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have confirmed Garlands since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is of the opinion that the next president will be named after the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected from Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not talked to Clinton yet whether she would name Garland and speculating him.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't provide a new candidate for a break.
Garland is the top judge for the US Appeals Court for the District of Colombia.
Raid said that the Republicans blocked the appointment of the Garland, were Lakes and assistants of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Treats wants a Christmas calendar for "Women and Men"
The Treats Magazine works together with photographer David Bellemera to produce a 1970's Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Museums Calendar for 2017.
The chief editor of Treats Steve Shaw told us this year that his nursery of old school-playboys was different since "Playboy is for men".
I'll do it for women.
He seems to have the view that the calendar is also done.
"We have to return to the display of timeless and classic tenderness, where both women and men are likely to feel and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release to publish the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can enter their pictures online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community calculated with mass flow
"If you don't fit and praise Erdogan, you're sitting on packed boxes," says the President of the Golden-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany is short-term with tens of thousands of asylum seekers flying from Turkey to Germany.
In the meantime, it could even be "a hundred thousand", according to the Alliance President Ali Toprak.
Because of the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the Putschverszech, the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I have calculated with tens of thousands, medium-term with a few hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Alliance President Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Since the government had already taken over Kurdian Hochburg months ago with punishments, there were 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey on the flight.
Even more secular and opposing ethnic Turks are added after the powdered powder.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further stressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a country that takes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The Federal Court of Justice condemned the deliberate possession of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alivitic cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the output pressure on the remaining curves.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been expelled or betrayed in the past hundred years," said Toprak, also a CDU member.
The Federal Government demanded that "the German government be placed in a position like Austria against Erdogan and its allies".
There is also a "hexenjagd" in Germany against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German twinge of the Golden Movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Opposition.
The brand market as a fuel trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"If you don't fit and praise Erdogan, you're sitting on packed boxes, the rest of the chemicals and scullers," said Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Golden-Earth Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Justice, the Turks have already represented the largest group of asylum-seekers in Germany who have been recognized for political persecution.
By Friday, June 30, this was 11.386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all people were entitled to asylum recognition (39.625).
In this collection, those who fled before war, poverty or despondency will not be found.
Asyl entitled under the principle of law are purely political, hence by state side, individual persecution.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it's going"
Selsamas Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The natives do not have anything from the summer election struggle with - and the holidayers from North Rhine-Westphalia can not choose the day of the country.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understand.
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer months, the Swiss Parliament has already decided on the beginning of the year.
For more than that, it will not go away: summer fairs, heats and landfills - this is the best.
The natives to be persuaded by the electors are on vacation.
The most popular holiday resorts in the country are on the road to Usedo, Rügen or Hidensee, are not local, so they cannot choose the country day.
There are practical problems: In the holidays, there are assistants who stop the plaques, blow balloons, distribute flyers and count on the final vote, only to be able to climb up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and the final anniversary, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to fight almost again against the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, just started.
And this is also true: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.
It will be exciting how strong Neuling AfD breaks down and what remains remains at the end of coalition days.
Selering, 66 years old and since 2008, the head of government, makes a almost endless election fight, looks from his big plates.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and pulsates a little with the people, just as it has already done his legendary harsh predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
On the other hand, Selering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel has the blame on the flowering of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, "We created it," has speeded up the rise of the legal police, which is likely to cost him the good office now.
The CDU, with its top candidates, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like when you fight at the wrong time at the wrong place.
She has invited two Chancellor Angela Merkel to college; Merkel is in the northeastern region of the Federal Republic of Germany.
But the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine-Westphalias, Berliners and Saxons as Mecklenburgers and Prepommers.
"There was probably the majority of other German countries," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it also harms no one from any other corner of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
On the other hand, the Northeast CDU is widely associated with the usual pollutant on market sites and in front of shopping centers with sunscreens and air balloons.
That, which means cokert, is just another "subordinated role".
The Union has also noted that it has broken down the base on the country that it has to work very hard to find a way back to the people.
You're going like the left, the SPD, the greens: there's hardly any place in the country's borders.
However, the Council of the CDU electoral fighter Kokert on his rivals is also self-sustained: "They must go where they are going, namely, where people are: villages, golden ages, every birthday celebration must be used."
Because much is at stake, Selering has now called his SPD to a particularly engaged election fight.
In questions, the social democracies last placed 22% behind partners CDU (25) and only nearly before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD was still clear with 35.6 per cent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small parties with seven percent in the polls, should create the spring in the country day.
They make a modern train from the holiday note and leave their selection struggle in large parts on the Internet.
"Online elections," it's called the country president Claudia Müller.
On the other hand, green electors are engaged in spying for local refugees.
Silke Gajek, the Spitten candidatin, just churns with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Seas and still finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "Walves in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27-sanning: guesthouses suffering from spraying
At the speed with which B 27 is cured, there is nothing to mix.
For those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 20 a.m., there is a lobby.
"They've made everything very shaky," says Elvira Tetzluff from the Jet-Tanchtal.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site was able to be planned to the south by the end of October.
It is also hoped that the meeting will be held responsible for the construction work, as far as it is concerned with the establishment of aid schemes.
Since the construction of the building on Monday to the south, and also the crossing of the Aspergstraße in Oftendingen, the connection to Rottenburg has been delayed within the area.
The citizens are now able to communicate both of them from the B 27.
The movement through the place seems to go back.
"There have been some major complaints," said the chief executive director, Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the Sanctions.
The inhabitants of Bachsatstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic learning, because many of them were looking for bad ways and trusted their ship more than the description.
What led to some Lkw freezing in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the Community requested strengthening of the measuring vehicle from Mussingen.
"There were significant overcrowds," says the King, who even announced himself before the situation.
They've already been left in two to three minutes.
The fastest route was in the Tempo-30 zone with 77 kilometres.
Since the building has been removed, it has become more quiet.
For business people at the B 27 there is only a little confidence that the road is now open for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27-sanctioning has led them to traffic interruptions, let anyone who asks, look through it.
However, there are some more and some less affected.
Those who have done less with the "end-users" thus produce for other companies, for which the sanctions have little effect.
Also at the Autohaus Mayer, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "highest slight return", but also points out that of course "the driving science is missing".
The most powerful are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, originally Krone, finds clear words.
That's already dangerous.
Not just him, but all the guesthouses have "hard hit."
It was missing customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We need to be happy about every euro change.
It refers to "more than 50 per cent".
The road repair has "returned back for two years".
Half of his employees had to leave him.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
On the contrary, President Jörg Schmidt asked whether there could be a financial balance, with the indication that guests would benefit others from the benefits of the situation at the B 27. Now they must also bring the benefits that can be achieved by the Sanctions.
Heaven is known by other regions where something so great has been done.
In all complaints, God is sure that his guests will continue.
Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history.
He can understand that the rest of the guests are now less often overlooked because of the complex traffic.
If you can't drive, it's also beautiful.
That his family client returns to the end of the healing work, there is no doubt about it.
Despite the crisis with BSE and Vugelgrip, Göhner maintains the effects of the B 27 construction work on his company for the biggest crisis that his guesthouse has experienced in their long-term history.
Six months of construction work, it's already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are regularly written.
After the latest attacks, Minister de Maizière now provides a thick security package.
But what does a state of terror have to do?
And what does the coalition partner say to all of them?
Thomas de Maizière is in Versöhner.
All its proposals will be "politically humourable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister in his new security package.
You don't ask anyone.
Other, further points would be discussed first within the parties.
I'm also involved in this.
However, as a interior minister, he had results and a "targetable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière allowed him to spend a little time presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, they are now much more extensive.
Some are already known, reported, played: that a new security authority should take care of the child's key communication is not new.
It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU proposals on flight data and the law of arms.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière started a second round of proposals that were not yet made with the SPD: he wanted to apply for sympathy for terrorist groups and to shut down the German passport with dual citizenship.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man adds.
Nevertheless, he kept this to himself and demanded nothing from the coalition partner without any chances.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have partly in mind: He plans fast procedures for abortions and more possibilities for arresting people before abortion.
Refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of claims for dismissed asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than before - such as committing the crimes or withdrawing their papers in order to distort their identity.
Some of these are politically and legally corrupt.
Some even seem unexplained and let questions open.
And at some point - when treating those who are patient, for example, the question arises: What does it really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between refugee issues and terrorism.
But there is no indication that the supporters of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about safety in view of the high rates of refugees.
And the things that people have worked so hard are not going to get out even now in times of election.
Internal security is enormously focused.
First the connections in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly concerned with internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a high gap between the two parties.
First of all, there is a strong dispute about the provision of the Federal Police, and then about a security policy gathering of some Union Interior Ministers, in which the Heads of State also demands a Burka ban and a withdrawal from the double citizenship of the state.
The Maizière is also interested in a suitable tone.
From a break from the double pass, he didn't hold anything.
We have enjoyed the discussion in Germany.
Don't make them feel good again.
And at a Burka ban, he has constitutional thoughts.
Whether its own package is constitutionally binding on all continents and whether it is really "mutual" for the coalition partner, it must only be shown.
There's something in there that could provide for the fight.
However, the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Partist Sigmar Gabriel first signaled careful speech preparation and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security".
People's cars are still moving smoothly.
Despite Dieselscanals, the world's sales figures are increasing.
But not all markets run around.
In the retrofaction there is a verb for a term.
People's cars start in the second half of the year when they are delivered.
In the past year, Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to display a plus of its many brands and some well-being markets.
In July, however, the VW core market was weakened mainly in Western Europe and re-selled the total sales as reported by the company mentioned in the Dax.
The world market sold VW in July with 449100 cars with 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, according to China's second most important market, sales accounted for 14 per cent under the previous month.
In Germany’s home market, the delivery was almost a sextillion.
Mr. Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker numbers from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, "changed economic framework conditions" have given rise to demand retention.
In addition to the situation surrounding the Turkish poll, a speaker explained that the British vote had also been imposed on Austria from the EU.
In the United States, where the cargo was first scaled, there is also a minute to book.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the main domestic brands of the Netherlands are still flexible through the diesel channel: after the first seven months, only a minimum delivery of 0.9 per cent is available to 3.37 million vehicles.
Mr. Fred Kappler was able to provide further sales from January to July.
1.3 per cent of more vehicles delivered by public cars at this time, the world's 5.904 million.
People's cars were manipulating with a software exhaust test.
Only in Germany, VW calls about 2.5 million cars to refurbished in the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the construction of the car has no negative effects.
After the conversion of vehicles, there is no damage to fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer issued a "guarantee" certificate after the conversion, but did not speak of a "guarantee" as it did on Friday in business circles.
The reason was legal features.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen assured his German customers yet now a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This was confirmed by representatives of VW in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
This meeting was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport.
"VW must fully comply with my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Disolutions are not accepted," declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that no damage to fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance following the conversion has been found and that all type-approval-related vehicle values are unchanged.
People's cars themselves use the term "protection" but not how it went in business circles.
In the broad definition of "Warranty" Volkswagen sees the possibility, for example, that customers will come to a factory with a motorcycle damage about half a year after refurbishment - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer's interest to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust channel to ensure a compromise regarding possible insurance arrangements, as it has done.
Therefore VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at Tegersee requires a number of savings in future sentences - as the second institution in Germany.
Banker Joseph Paul said on Thursday: "It's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and does not see any sign in it: Normal savings have to "not be afraid to pay for their sparrow punishment".
Stores Banks Money per night at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay 0.4 per cent of their penalty.
This fee is required by the Gmund Raiffeisenbank from September of private and company customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on Giro or daily accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros a year," said Paul.
It has been worth 40 million euros, which could be raised from one day to the other and which it could not evaluate.
"They are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs," said the bank chief.
"I can't lend for every million euros."
The costs are now in line with the complainant's principle.
"I've already experienced four cases, I don't want the fifth," said the Bank's Board.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other types of facilities.
Only a few went to other banks.
The Bayern Association stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate is causing significant costs to all banks."
You can only take it if you're "business-in-house" is not possible.
As a result, some German banks have increased their accounts, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringer People's and Raiffeisen Bank of Altenburger Country had made its 2014 Skatbank Filiale.
Michael Kemmer, head of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect that private customers will have to pay flat-rate payments for investment, so the competition in Germany is too strong under banks and crackas".
A banker said that at the scene of the scene there was "a client equipped with something more expensive than wealth."
"This can become a problem for a small bank," if it was free of money.
The Geossenschaftsbank Gmund, founded in 1911, has two sets in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegersee.
The region is home to famous players, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bayern Association "no other banks are known to calculate an outlay for private customers" said speecher Ernst.
The President of the German People's Banks and Raffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fréhlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative against the private customer is very, very high".
Competitiveness is hard, and it causes the confusion of employees to compete.
Customers in Germany will not be allowed to fall into this category.
Destination discs: who actually buys shell discs?
Single men in middle age love discs.
Before you decide to comment on it under Pseudomym NotAllOne MenMitlerenAlders with raw instructions, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the multi-language reconstruction of shell discs is not about a tree in millenniaals that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to return to medium-nostalgia.
Those who have bought a record shortly are all expected to be between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.
It is also not a word by Hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older shoppers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog had a message on the TV, the camera would follow me while I was walking through a business street in Soho, carrying a certain grey approach and strutting wildly before I stand up, holding my hands and saying something specific like, "So, let us take a closer look at it."
So let's get a look at it.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly enters his charm - Hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which the first independent sellers were present - there is still a great deal of special plate shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to different men in such businesses and try to assess your age and pride by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, where I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) in Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably about 20 years old, is a long day due to a meeting in London and goes through business to complete the few hours.
Is he a collector, I'm asking?
"I already appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These boots, painted above (he sent me the chat room by e-mail, I didn't follow him at home), dressed the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and Singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy discs that he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items that he sold when he was young.
"Many things I buy are early 70s from the late 60s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I probably was too young to buy me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are more introverted and willing to spend their time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my load.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on the YouTube profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old plates again.
From the discussions I have conducted, people have usually completed their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who first sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again," he says.
This would explain the tree to attach to the surface of a certain age.
But what about the emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that plate shops offer a relaxing community of equal owners.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took anstop on the wireless payment system.
Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to return to the stability of trusted plate holes, from objects that generate happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or possession of material owners as a sort of trust," Wez says.
That's how it's with me as a collector, and I think it's with many people.
It's a simple way to work spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" a worker bursts out of a plate chair.
An ICM survey in April concluded that almost 50% of the people who bought a record in the last month have not yet heard.
The survey also found that 41% had a disc player that they never used, while 7% of those who bought a disc do not own a disc player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried while I was looking through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who worked at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), noticed a "trophyen look" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead chip so that I can put it in regular mode," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product load, less music class.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, who only come slowly.
Fopp, who has devoted almost a whole day to the boots, has a better audience than I do.
There are couples around the 70, tourists, photographers, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the previously mentioned businesses - Wild Beauts newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz comes from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity in the customers.
None of them look particularly united, but after psychological traumas are difficult to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running here for a few minutes and looks at the variation of the plates available for sale.
She's making a store bomb instead of a big purchase.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is..." she runs off with a favorite driver.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate fans: Urban Outfitters.
While I gave the chance to show the Jeans Hotpants, I watched a group of young teenagers grouping around polaroid cameras for a moment, before a father and his daughter passed on to buy a crossley board player.
On the left is a wooden house, a wall full of tablets from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one sees them - perhaps because they are just pure decorative, some as far up as it is impossible to grasp them.
It's pure plate art.
But in view of the fact that any attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that a group of people who have more time and money than others are also those who spend most of their time on luxury items like plates.
Even if my studies have shown that the results of YouGov agree, they will, at least in flats in Soho, the large number of female collectors and court lovers who exist in reality, flats and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They do not spend their Thursday morning with security with the bubbles through Berwick Street shops and the leaves through plates, while they share the exciting view of a secret, 30-year-old false moderator, who does not raise any strange men of the middle age over the shoulders.
The Grönlandhai is the longest-lived Wibeltrie - Video report
Scientists say that Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all wild animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examined the Hague, says that the record was at a female age, from which it is concluded that it is between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters long.
French court favours the offer of abortion by businesses in Dschungel refugee camps from
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to lower tens of thousands of temporary businesses and restaurants in the district of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court proceedings this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to reduce 72 provisional sales, in which persons in the stock of goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer free services or tea for 50 cents (40 pounds) or simple meals for a couple of euros in provisional restaurants.
Professor Calais argued that these places should be reduced because they would represent a parallel economy, which would not be paid for by taxes and which would pose a risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups shared with the court that business and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also indicated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who carried out 72 provisional business, but pointed out that the suspicions of the professor of Calais "are absolutely satisfactory."
Justice Jean-François Molla said that food business, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than eating only people who "live in extremely pre-existing conditions."
He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the Dutch region was the Young Book Kids' Cafe of the camp, which is used jointly and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids' coffee.
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the conclusion would be "for these children a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are older."
The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrants appreciated on Friday that the number of people living in the Dschungellar had increased by over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steady increase in the number of newborns during the summer.
Despite the Olympics: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disturbing appearance in the Olympics, Rod Prof. Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I keep the WM in mind, remain confident and fight further," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He does not have a statement for his miserable twelfth place in the sugar house.
"I really find it hard to comment on the timing of yesterday," Martin said.
He had to take a peaceful analysis of the reasons for his refusal.
At the time-WM in October in Qatar, Martin really wanted to fight the title.
"I'll see exactly what we've changed in the past."
"This is also my position," wrote the three-time world champion who had lost in the middle of the week more than three minutes on the Olympic Fabian Cancella (Switzerland).
Olympics: Tennis Profi Siegend perforated semifinals
The victory of Laura Siegendund ended in the fourth final of Rio: The World Range list-32. from Metzingen was replaced by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) The half-final of the Olympic tennis tournament is clear.
As a result of return problems, they were able to pass on only once and act in comparison with the previous rounds without force.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) still had the chance to jump into the pre-trial round.
The Australian open-minded woman met the British Johanna account (No. 10).
As a last German tennis professor, Tommy Haas 2000 held a medal (Silber) in Sydney.
Two German DTB starters in the fourth final of summer games had given it last in 1992.
Never before was a German duo in an Olympic single semifinal.
Group increases at startup-up for live video broadcasts
Other people are interested in playing video games, which is a main focus - it also wants to benefit Microsoft.
The technology company buys the start-up beam that specializes in this hobby.
As much money for the acquisition flows, Microsoft did not share it on Thursday.
Beam went to the start with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but you can also intrude on yourself.
For example, they can provide the players with missions and deliver enemies as well as equipment items.
The playerial activity Blizzard begins a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already rising.
The staff of the start-up, who has so far been in Seattle in Washington, U.S. state, will refer to the Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam's founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi announced.
No change should be made to customers by taking over.
Beam is integrated around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming video games is now increasing dramatically.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by the online dealer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google-Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser needs to set itself on the next generation speed meter: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices will be tested, which will be particularly effective for the timers.
For example, the future-acting force trainer of the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used for emergency points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on road construction sites or in sanitating bridges, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that the speed limit is maintained with a fixed viewer.
But a lasting mobile building can be dangerous or dangerous.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days of uninterrupted measurement, the crash data will be transmitted via a modem.
In addition, Laser Mestechnik can detect all vehicles via multiple tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as time-limits for travel, driving and vehicle classes can also be monitored.
In the high-risk condition, you can move the trailer by calling manufacturer with each car with attachment coupling.
In order not to be easily charged, he is reduced to measuring, so that the wheels will disappear in the pendant and the rest of them will also disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the viewer from vandalism.
Since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to the data provided by Vitronic in various federal countries and is also used in the meantime.
Foreign authorities will also stay with the new technology: Younger France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
United Kingdom takes silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass holds gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain on the 7th of Rugby came at the end of Thursday evening at the end of the last door in the form of the Fiji, when they were shot in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave a master class in handing, side-stepping, back-up, line running and red force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The Netherlands was rewarded by the not-so-bad Silver Medal’s Trust Prize - the fourth of Britain on this day - and could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear download of the boxes, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have shot a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a trust for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one British will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way back.
Eight years ago she lost herself under Ryan every game at Adelaide Sevens.
They're just losing one.
This gap will grow, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started to be wonderful and let the GBs attack out of space.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as you would run in running buses. The World Series winner went up to 5-0 as Osea Colinisau in the corner.
Four more minutes of play, Jerry Twai added another attack from the right corner he turned.
12-0 and GB never caught the ball.
A great touch of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua in the right corner had a touchdown and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one from the rehearsal and it was still over a minute game time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovovovovovo was impressed by further weak tactics of the GB team and ran up to the line to make a tower.
The change took 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play 7 while GB is still to learn.
That's right.
GB led fundamental changes in half time and finally the Fijian luxury...for all four minutes, which was good for the relationships of the first half, until Josua Tuisova passed after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Then Norton began an attempt for GB, made a tuchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was already in favor of the southern islanders, whose fans sang, fed and dance on the tribune.
It wasn't hard to surprise the player's approach to Fiji.
Mata Williams set the i-dubs with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfiff died, the Fijis fell asleep, and GB shot at the raisins.
Earlier that day, Fiji had won Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and South Africa was forced into a close half-final match from the race - the conversion of the UK to the difference.
Kyle Brown carried the box in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footwork and drew a door under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant later take-off by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, assured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired by struggle with the cancer of the trainer to ruberside
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that wants to be said.
From the first to the last, 220 hearts of Hiev, who entered history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was only the two who were sitting on the wheel, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams was all-time when they talked to the second Olympics in the two without a taxing woman, the first women in the history of the British sport who placed such a level.
Her domain was absolutely, always her 39th uncomplicated use, which is also exemplary.
What we see are two brilliant Athletics that match over the surface with the elegance of shade, which does not reflect the type of triumph to genes.
Behind every gold in mine, a battalion belongs to volunteers who contribute to the progressive progress that makes the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the trainer who didn't know if he would survive this day than he was diagnosed with cancer.
As you said, there was a risk.
I had blasen krebs, which is operable, and they did it.
If you don't, he'll spread out everywhere.
It would have been a very bad situation.
It changes a little bit of the look.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio had been lucky that he could begin his treatment at the beginning of 2014, beyond the season, what the interruption would have meant to a minimum, if it had been the proper concept under such circumstances.
I needed the money, so I had to go back soon.
It was a rehearsal.
I was in the hospital and loved it at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Ruders are already a challenge, but this makes it even bigger.
In the immediate realization of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking something else and trying to process his own passions.
Stanning, who was the head of the Royal Artillery regime in an application in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional shock this week. That might be something extreme, but it means so much."
It goes on to say how much it means to me, how much Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thanks go to him. He's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train me or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no interest in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't handle.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams started from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had plenty of spare parts.
We were arrested very much at the moment.
Helen called " Stay in the process, Stay in the process."
It's really important not to let yourself go.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we weren't about to do something great.
We didn't want a fire today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, get out and win the race, what we're doing.
The couple will take time for a year before decisions about their future will be made.
Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have meant a lot of pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic hero.
It was so new to me, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 Years Preparable for Clearness
The business leader of the "Weinstein Group", Ruppert Göller, goes to peace.
The connection is considered to be "formally low width".
A small French drinking water-producing link is a model for large water producers.
So it was in the originalton some time ago in an entry of the Bayerian roundfunk.
Shortly thereafter, the Water Forum of the Government of Sub-França de la sub-França de de la subfrança de l'étado de l'és de l'étado de l'és de l'és de l'évelopé de l'és de l'és de l'és de l'és de l'és de l'és de l'és de l'és de l'és de l'és de l'és de l
The work of the Vetenstone Group is considered to be "by far as exemplary".
After all, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the association of staff, was 28 years of age as a business leader.
Now, at the age of 65, he was taken to peace.
The drinking water source association of the Vetenstein group with its seat in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, provides approximately 150000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and toilets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Members of the community are the towns of Churchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Bauanach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and communities.
The current president, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Güller was appointed as a water guard in 1985 and was already appointed the business leader of the association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very varied and they have been extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency implementation on weekends," said the president.
As an outstanding event, she announced the introduction and expansion of new sources (1994), basic purchases in the field of new sources (1998) and the destruction of farmers, the treatment of high-level stocks (1999), the creation of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water management.
There have been no steady state and there have always been innovations since water life is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, they praised Düller’s trust, trust, and proper service for over 31 years.
He has used a lot of heart blood for his water supply, and he has regularly lived the water supply as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, he was able to present as a true practitioners the success concept of the Venetian Group for nitration before the Water Forum in the area.
He's got a lot of recognition and praise for that.
Rupert Göller, who worked with him for 28 years, praised Alphons Griebel.
He's the best water waiter and he was a trusted button.
Together, we were a team that was unforgettable.
As high points from his point of view, he referred to the construction of the bridge and the restructuring of the purpose link.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the rohrbrück at the top of the church hall on 3 January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, the whole night must be worked back so that the houses can be provided with water.
The supply of Neubrunn has also been maintained only once because it has filled the top of Pettstadt here with holes.
The management of the drinking water chain was transferred to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, the successor of Rupert Göller.
Sopranistina Anna Nettrebko is open with the autism of her son Tiago and turns to other parents concerned: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was diagnosed in her son, she believed that she had to die.
But the eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where it gives the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something back two years ago, when I sing on the Milanese scale, he doesn't remember anything," said Nestebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection to the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Lieutenant Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in bondage - Man shoots at life-threatening
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on the Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multifamily house in Barghtehehe (Kreis Stormrn) and killed her.
"The man himself called and ordered us to have his life-threatening accident," said a police spokesman.
The acter will be on the run, after him will be publicly punished.
In the middle of the night, Sven S. could be on the road with the car.
The man is about 1,80 meters large, muscle-burned, and has a glass.
In the meantime, the police published a photo of him.
However, it's a few years old.
In the middle of the man wears a glass.
The man should not be called directly.
He could still take the guns with him, like the police.
Whoever sees Sven S. should call 110.
The police speak of a relationship state.
The victim was in 1988, in 1981.
At first, the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any data on the action or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims; but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder case."
"We don't say anymore," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
The following eyes were a special command (SEK) on the tatort.
Steel - light for the German steel industry
The energy-intensive German steel industry continues to suffer from additional costs to millions.
The financial benefits which the industry derived from the ecostrom supply are from the table.
It remained with the release of the renewable energy plant in the stock plants for the so-called property production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Agriculture Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Journal" (WAZ, Freita issue).
"I am really glad that we were able to reach the end after two years of negotiations."
The European Commission, therefore, had originally planned to request the steel manufacturers to use the gas from the ceiling for electricity production for their own consumption.
According to the German industry, additional costs amounted to EUR 120 to 240 million per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in steel works will a 20 per cent EEG plant fall.
But neither will these be raised in the steel industry.
The IG metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the construction of its own electricity.
This will allow the status quo of the previous arrangement to be laid down in more detail.
The success of Gabriel's efforts in the steel industry is particularly important.
"In view of our campaign 'Steel is the future' is the first step."
"Continue to follow."
"The reform of the Emissions Law should also consider climate and employment objectives," IG Metal Chief Jörg Hofmann said in Frankfurt.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacities and a significant price pressure.
In the past year, the situation continued when China, the world's largest producer country, in view of the fragile domestic demand, was mass-fat steel on the world market.
European producers are offering Chinese steel companies price dumping.
During this early year, the situation was somewhat tense.
On the other hand, the economic outlook in China has been suspended for a show of bound imports on imports of steel.
It's not clear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry premium Thyssenkrupp remained on Thursday.
In the past, the prices had been reimbursed.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with additional costs.
The Thassenkrupp also wanted to exclude the closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July the German steel manufacturers remained cautious despite increasing prices and increasing orders.
They produced by 3.4 million tonnes well six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Union announced steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced was now back in the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two per cent below the previous year's value.
The link is calculated in the coming months thanks to an improved contract load with an increasing outlet.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing to Older Ones Good
The song has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school, in the teacher's studio she played the art of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, happy and whole-lived, she says.
Above all, they do good in their health and in their spirit.
Because Singing is equally a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniors.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music, says Hackler.
Through regular association, seniors can break social contacts and take care of them.
Because social and family structures often arise in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "I want to talk and organize myself to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association".
Singing can be in a positive sense, Mr Hackler.
Because seniors train a deep and controlled atmosphere.
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs does not make it so fast every day.
Even when it comes to getting the voice of the voice in the age, singing is an optimal hobby.
In older people, Singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common song had a much higher position, which was part of every day, both in school and in free time, she explained.
Lenz often observes that the singing or hearing of songs in older people causes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
The lyrics of songs and especially the melody of melodys are self-depressed people on long-lasting events.
The head will also receive special performance at singing, Lenz explains.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a proposed rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.
Good older people who live alone do so, not just focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by the singing in the choir, says Hackler.
A popular audience is a great lobby.
The self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
See for yourself: If I take long for something, I will be better and grow up above me - this experience will strengthen.
There are good reasons to start with the song, so there is enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new Hobby should not hesitate - even if he wants to have a little talent, save Lenz.
You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people who already hear when a sound goes out there?
On the search for the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the familiar circle is in a senior school, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer views about the choirs in the environment.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can go directly to the community or the church president.
Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet search.
The one who has to sing should join a choir without any needing to join, says Hacker.
Singing does good to the soul and has something to release - that's true for every age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats on the wings of young animals
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of the Call of Katzenbabys on adult animals.
To their surprise, the monkeys also did not call men – but they always felt differently to the women.
Women's cats can recognize the degree of achievement of Katzenbabys at the mills.
They respond about ten percent faster to the voice of cats, who mention themselves in great need, as scientists have discovered from the Animal University and the Hannover Medical School (MHH).
However, Kate also reacts to the noise of Kätzchen - but always the same.
"It is obvious that the acoustic differences between the minions of less and stronger young animals for men are neither verifiable nor of importance," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the BMC Evolutionary Biology magazine.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the length and height of the ketchchen square differed from the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the maintenance of the MHH.
They were given a call from small ones who were taken three minutes from the wurf box and separated from mothers and babies.
On the other hand, they were faced with screams of stronger erection, which were further raised.
The researchers maintain their results despite the low strength tests.
"All women, even those who had not yet had their own grandchildren, reacted differently to the cry," Konerding said.
They quickly turned to the speaker when this sound of the very nice cats played.
This ability may have been born or developed with the sex record.
"It was a surprise that the men had reacted at all," said the biologists.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby cancer in humans several times.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to saugligs, whether they were already mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski meets with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sikur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an order was issued against the sole football star Hakan Sikur.
He will be asked to be a member of a terrorist group.
The first time after the Putschves test, Turkey again has an important football game.
The official line of business as usual is said before the duel between the sights of Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya.
In July, when the exemption was lifted, the government, which should not be affected every day by ordinary citizens, indicated that they were not to be affected.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of listening to the movement of the preacher Fethullah gullen, which is responsible for the trash test.
This will not be done before the football game.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sikur, the government authorities issued a court order.
In the meantime, he is invited to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sikur should be a candidate of the President of Fethullah Gülen, who will be responsible for the Putschvrechtsche Reception Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the exemption rate for the first 90 days is still valid until October, it actually has a good effect on the lives of most Turks, but it has no effect.
The evening 'Democratic Guard' on public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday for the end.
The sport is - like the whole country - split into allies and rivals of Erdogans.
Special fans of the Labour Club are not traditionally considered to be the friends of the President.
What is happening in the history of Turkey, but in view of dramatic experiences, is the strict abolition of military forces.
Even the fans are few - no matter whether their heart is beating for Galatasaray or sights.
The pocalypse "Gala" will be especially welcome to Lukas Podolski.
His sporting value was demonstrated by the Kolner in the current season: With 17 towers and nine samples in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first game as top scorer.
At the end of the game against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fantatic" married him: "He was the best in the place."
He concluded the season in an excellent way and secured his men's pocal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the surprising season for the recordmaster found a promising conclusion.
After the pre-run K.o in the League champions, the "Lunöen" also spread early in Europe League.
In the super light, it was only about six.
The season wasn't good.
The poker was the only chance to win something.
"That's what we've done, and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For master visas, the game year was better.
In particular, Mario Gomez, who was the founder of the 14th title of the super-Lig-Lig-Torschückenkenkenkung with 26 season contributions.
That is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-olds.
In this case, the CF Florenz had been under contract and had only been notified of Gomez after the poll, because of the political situation in the country after his EM leave.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the professional magazine "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.
However, the stormers had to be ready to abandon around a third of its estimated EUR 7.5 million annual balance sheet, Orman explained: "We cannot pay for its content in Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medals at Olympics in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already arrested twice because of Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistlelower Julia Stepanowa cannot start in Rio.
Other overcrowded leichtatelettic sinuses can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio about medals.
The theme Doping is just like before the shootings at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian skimmer Julia Jefimowa, who, after a doping spree, had charged her initial rights shortly before the games, was quickly shaken and destroyed at her start (100 metres) without delay.
There is a dark scenario: With a raised layer, she was still glorified in the hall and was provoked by her appearance.
As soon as she realized she wasn't going to get gold, the audience went out in a jubilee storm.
But there are still many other athletes who, despite Doping's past in the Olympics in Rio, go to the start.
Here's a overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in the literature.
He was already arrested twice because of Dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his band, the Olympics of 2004 and the former World Master have run even faster than before, he is more than 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price (100, 4x100-m-Stiffel/Jamika): The second Olympics and seven-year-olds in the world had to have a six-month spree after they were shown the introduction of the disease of oxygen.
After an operation, she had severe tooth pain, and she defended herself at the age of 29.
Sandra Perkovic (Discuss/Croatia): The 2012 Olympics, World Masters 2013 and European Masters from 2010 to 2016 were tested positive on the banned stimulants methylhexanamin.
Perkovic is fighting the major adoption and has been shut down for six months.
The four largest figures in this year go to the account of the great goldfavorites.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Stiffel/USA): The Beijing Olympics and two world champions over 400 m, were tested positive in 2010 and closed for 21 months.
A means of extending the pension had been responsible, meaning Merritt.
In this year, the 30-year-old is more than 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Almost one athlete was known for his many medals at night.
So Tychon lost his WM title in 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
In addition, the average 40-year-old Olympic silver had to be awarded for Steroid Dopings and the EM title for testosterone abuse in 2006.
He also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sport Court CAS.
With 80.04 m, it is located on the rank of two of the world's ranges.
Liu Hong (20 km) Goen, China: The World Recorder and Goldfavoritin was tested positive only in May, but can still start in Rio.
At the age of 29 years, the world's oldest teacher found indications of the introduction of a banned food supplement, the spree of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell out slowly and died on July 13.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austerreicherin injured - Several deaths
The Austrian message in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
You have had cuts and have been treated in the hospital, but you have already been able to leave it.
Her home trip was planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the other explosions on the Phuket holiday island and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is therefore in constant contact with local authorities.
The Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok’s capital, was originally bombed at the Donnerstagbend in a two-wheeled mine.
According to the police, about 20 people, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians, were killed by a Thai country.
On Friday morning, two explosives came up again, and according to the authorities, another man was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.
In the detonation near the Badestrands Patong, popular in holiday resorts, a taxi driver was injured after police raids.
In Surat Thani at the south coast of the country then launched another bomb that killed a city agent.
According to the source, the authorities in a flower zone had gone into the air before the coastal police review.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang were requested at the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon at the south-east coast were several injuries.
You're going out of a relationship with the explosions in Hua Hin, it happened.
"The bombings carry the same manuscript," said General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists.
"We're going to say it's a coordinated attack."
It's too early to get out of there - it's probably about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thailand's media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical of Muslim separatists in the southern part of the country.
The Thai police nevertheless stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamic resistance movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local Saturdays that restrict themselves to restricted areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
It is much more likely that the bombs were placed on the fronts of the dominant military unit.
In the past days, the authorities had received confidential evidence of previous attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed about the exact time and place.
It's still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police showed their staff throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings and airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are still smaller bomb attacks, but they are not often directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the current bombings, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its website that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed without delay.
High safety risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Sunghkla as well as Preah Vihear and the environment.
According to austerity provisions between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary travel will be cancelled in these provinces.
Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a bill drawn up by the military junta.
This also has a major impact on the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to hit Chaos while the country was moving towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.
The military route, which took power after a phase of bloody unrest in 2014, is itself worthy of reinvigorating the Kingdom to stability and order.
However, it has not been possible for the military to get into the grip of Muslim rebellion in the eastern southernmost part of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.
In Bangkok almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu screen - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "identificial movement" has been set up as a visa for constitutional protection.
In addition, after several national officials, the constitutional defenders in the feds also took note of the group.
"We see in the 'identional movement' points of reference for efforts against the free democratic framework," said President Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, foreign Islamic beliefs or from the close east are detached in extremism.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identary Movement" is a group of French verbs, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It refers to "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "loss of its own identity through overcrowding".
Constitutional protection in nine German countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringen - already observed the "identifiers".
The measure said that its authority had closely agreed with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identity movement' try to get their target group out of there where they are," said the constitutional security officer.
In general, extremists try to communicate with young people with language, often with poppyer music.
Islamists do this as well as legal extremists.
That's not a significant advertising for your own business.
The propaganda should reach people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
In recent years it has provided reports from several federal countries about contacts of the "identifiers" to AfD politicians.
I mean, he said he didn't have any knowledge.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It comes to the fact that the individual party - in this case the AfD - has been changed by certain persons who are extremists, change their direction and thus become extremist.
It is therefore exceptional whether such persons have a control influence on the party.
This is not recognized.
In view of the significant increase in law-enforced sanctions and attacks on asylum-makers and refugee settlements, he would not yet speak of new legal terrorism in this context.
But in the past years, we have established that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the Old School Society group or the Freitaler Group.
It may be clear that further terrorist groups or minority groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee camps or attacks from other legal extremist motives.
However, a German or European rule of law terrorism is not recognised.
The previous groups were established at the regional level or in social networks.
Concerned that many references to the account of people who had not previously been identified in the right scene were taken into account.
That's the concern.
Many of the perpetrators of attacks on asylum were not previously known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing in the way of law enforcement before, which may have been politically neutral or have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or links that have been radicalized by legal extremism."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros has become online
The Olympics or world record do not always determine the score in the Olympics.
This shows the courageous attitude of Robel Kiros in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the light-weighted swimming pool from Ethiopia was so slow that it was not to be seen in the TV images anymore.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the section was chosen.
In the social networks, there has been a combination of virtual Internet hits.
In fact, the 24-year-old completes with a delay of 48 seconds and completes the 59th place of 59 stars.
But it was not just his sports figure, which drew the attention of international media to itself.
Why does 24-year-olds still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian received a special right from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make Swimming known in the countries represented.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, they simply wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros has made himself ready for the big race.
The first names quickly made the rounds.
Some media called him "Robel der Wall."
Instead of a "Wowstandhouse" the English Boulevardblat "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made it fun.
His time, he just ran for a minute and almost five seconds over 100 meters freestyle, did not play a role there.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also taken.
During the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani drew attention to media attention.
The appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to stand alone in a run over 100 metres freestyle.
Frenetically, Mossambani was attacked at the time.
The 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the battle.

An open industrial elevator in DTLA gets a comfortable makeover
We celebrate the 90th birthday of the central library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a shop at the New Place has been ordered.
According to the police, the 67-year-old geretsrieder had left her business on Monday at 17.30 a.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned the next morning at 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros were lost in the case.
The shooter's tracks could not be found.
Also a video surveillance is not available.
Trump does not see the current selection layer as close
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump talks on an election campaign in Florida.
If there is nothing to do with the election to the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative.
There's a ride in the holiday.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, it would be relatively inappropriate for him: "It's going to be either hit, or I have a very, very, very, long holiday," said the candidate of the Republicans in a telephone interview with the US television transmitter CNBC.
If it's not enough for him at the end of political justice, it's all right, Trump said.
He thus named the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, he had become more and more rebellious.
Post is increasing in trade with electric transporters
An electric vehicle of the German mail in action.
The interest of other companies in the risk is obvious.
The post plans to sell your electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In a short time, the company wants to start dealing with the carrier.
The post will also offer its electric carriers from the coming year on the free car market.
"We want to start selling to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been testing whether they should be sold to other companies with letters and packages for months.
Mr Gerdes, Mr Gerdes, had said that there was always another question, about handworkers.
According to information from the news magazine "The Spiegel" the Bonner Group wants to support the mass production of vehicles in the short term.
In the subsequent manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electroautos and that it had long been a complete turn on the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're making the complete fleet.
The streetScooter has been active in Germany since 2014.
GfK management is based on surprising business figures
The consumer research company GfK is the head of Mattias Hartmann.
The retreats came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult position of the market research company GfK has led to the fact that the chair of President Matthias Hartmann will become more uncertain as long as the success promised by him remains.
Turbulenzens at the top of the Nürnberg Market Research Company GfK: After reassessing business figures and the return of the company, the global number five of the industry is before a personal start.
GfK Head of State wants to leave the company for the next year.
The President of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahert, is already acting on 12 September from the Supervisory Board.
The management of the board was already taking place on 1 September by the previous member of the board, Gerhard Hausruckinger, who shared with the company.
He should officially assume the function of a "Proposer" until a successor to Hartmann has been found.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company referred to the long-term business policy approach "a variety of views".
Details did not want to be called a business speaker on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In the case-laws, there was a great deal of confusion on the day when the shareholders were last aware of the continuing success of the restructuring undertaken years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK Summit since 2011.
"But the fruit of restructuring is still not to be seen after 5 years," it said.
In view of the latest bad GfK business figures, each participant will at any time be disappointed.
"If it were in the case of BMW, the Quants would do the same," it said.
The company was unable to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 after repayments in the previous quarter.
With EUR 361.2 million, the turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the corresponding previous quarter.
With regard to the first half of the year, the turnover of EUR 721.2 million fell by 3.4 per cent.
The profit in the second quarter was mainly due to the company's low value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The firm's signatures of EUR 139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business area, protected the company from the loss of EUR 148.2 million under the strike.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK was still a group win of 19.7 million.
Accidents - bus crashing in Krummmhurn in graves: Eight wounded
In the event of an accident of a travel bus with 43 elderly people as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the insatises experienced severe injuries, and the police shared with them.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to reduce its data to an agreed cargoer, who was part of the railway.
The bus came right out of the street and jumped into a grave, as reported by Aurich/Wittmund police speaker.
"Because of the position of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
Fire rage frees the insatises.
Six rescue cars and a noteboard arrived at the country street 2.
The unencumbered travelers were brought back from a line bus to the town hall of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the driver and witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic meter of water shall be payable from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkhal 3,44 instead of EUR 2,10; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 Euro (up to EUR 2,26) and for Azendorf 3,64 (up to EUR 2,18).
In the Azendorf facility, the water tax will be increased no later than once if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an excessive calculation, the water price in Azendorf will then be EUR 4.37 per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhauser (CSU) reported, it was determined by the Landrassamt Kulmbach that disclosures were made for these wastewater plants.
The Kasendorf market has been obliged to carry out the facilities on a cost-effective basis because of legal grounds.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens and business and industry companies from Welschenkhal, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to be caught in the stock exchange.
The tax increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of the charges was necessary for the removal facilities of the market.
During the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-relationships from the previous calculation period would also be comparable.
The gravitating tax increases were based on Schmidt, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year for all three waterways around relatively small facilities with a very low waterfall.
This would have been the result of the low distribution base, for example, the use of necessary repairs by several thousand euros.
In addition, the removal income in all three plants is relatively slow.
Furthermore, during the period of calculation, all three plants were not last affected due to their age of sanitation and repair applications in a significant extent.
The plant in Azendorf is about 30 years old, the plant for Welschenkhal, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf water treatment plant the mechanical combustion plant had to be replaced because of a damage.
In the pumpwerk Welschenkhal, almost 20 years old support facilities had to be overrun for reason, and the Lopp plant had to be restored after almost 20 years of operation of the first lighting system, the lighting lamp was removed and an additional lighting facility was built to enable water law to be maintained in the future.
Schmidt: "To take account of these exceptional applications, the continued cost of maintenance and maintenance must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs which are still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses indicated that in the case of the low waterfall in the three plants, the applications for the operation and maintenance were "full".
In addition, Schmidt lost the market share of large maintenance costs in the wastewater plants in the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants will continue to be predominate in view of stone houses, and in particular, the supply area of the hydrocarbon-related refrigerators could not be extended to these plants because it is more sophisticated.
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria is 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October, as positive 0.2% have been booked.
The annual average inflation rate of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% in July 2015.
In July 2016 a price increase was observed for the following groups of consumers: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
The prices fall in clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remain as in the premonmonite at alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to race.
With its filter tool, it enables Snapchat about 150 million users daily to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way and a way that is already limited to absurd.
You can turn into ananas, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Liechtenstein image.
The filters are unbridled, property-producing tools that generate more than 30 million improved Selfies per day.
All mistakes have been made to the public.
Snapchat filters have been critical in the past, in which they were accused of promoting the app blackface or white skin as a beauty side.
When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them locks, false teeth and uplifted walls, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Gelebbe face".
They wondered whether these repeated contradictions would indicate a greater problem that the company has a variety.
News and improvisation were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, one day after the snapshot, that it had deactivated the feature.
The company apologized: The filter was thought to be a homogee to anime characters and not as a character of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of harmful clicks.
Others chose the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely distributed about the photos, wrote that the filter was "stupid and unappreciative."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the opposition of a very different Asian character and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-eyed, but that the yellow-eye has been drawn into an abbreviated extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross this cultural bridge.
The American culture seems to be developed in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchats, a large audience of young people - who are different in matters of race than their older players - could go beyond waiting for sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters generates a picture that is misleading for a user, "it is much harder to remain undetected than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and media engineer, decided to delete her snapshot account, asked others to do the same.
In a video presentation and a telephone interview, she said that she believed that race-related conflicts reflected a lack of diversity in the settings at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the great part of white, only male leadership, and ended their siege with a Hashday: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Neither do they have different representations of people with other skin colors in their possession, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or willing to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that the Snapchat has left largely unresponsive.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its membership and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, it encouraged Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of his staff, but according to one speaker, the company has recently put in place a staff responsibility that focuses on sub-represented groups of people and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on the other hand, said that her snapshot account will be closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users than we need to say that it's not O.K.."
Military conduct of the Federal ISIS Secret Service Information, Committee of the Congress sets up
Military members of the United States Central Command changed the news service information in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual situation to take place, a committee of inquiry of the Congress reported a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Military Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Wehrbudget Committee, is a report of great discontent under the Central Command, secret service providers who reported their appreciation for American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Newstational information, which was typically absorbed by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual presence of the place and were more positive than the analysis of other news services," a newspaper quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses of our political leaders are presented," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the representative's house.
The leadership errors in Centcom reach the top level of the organization.
The tenth report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi combat forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government opinions have given Obama instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have seen the pressure of their regulations to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements were significantly more positive than the facts were in line with the report," the report said.
For example, a Centcom audience announced that a military retreat could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, it is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman of Kansas, in a opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's peaks changed the news service reports to take the risk out of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans call on the Task Force to live after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation.
In addition, further disclosures of the Centcom reports are made by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very limited process for the creation of news service estimates to ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the Committee's High-Special Democrat, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Shipf, in an opinion.
This process, said Mr. Shipf, "has delayed the publication of news services," damaged the moral among analysts and "give too little room for different opinions."
But Mr. Ship and the Democrats said that they had not found any evidence of an introduction to the White House at the Centcom analysts on a "determining political opinion".
The preliminary results of the conference's findings were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, New York Times reported reports of investigations by the general inspector-inspector of the Friday, who were filed after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentecostal press speaker, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while the general inspector's findings were still in progress.
But he also noted that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions about interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion on these important subjects of national defence."
The findings have taken effect on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made between a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the charges of last year have raised the question of whether President Obama can leave behind the Central Command for the fair appreciation of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The critics of the secret information about the Islamic state recall doubts over more than ten years ago, as a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote about how the then government under George W. Bush, against the recommendations of many analysts, saw only a small measure of ownership in Iraq and did little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in standing up against the current report on the Islamic state.
In the past year, the team of Mr. HoOKer, according to government agencies, found that, contrary to the government's statement, air charges against the refineries held by the Islamic State, had no significant impact on the financing of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries had been operating to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcoms, then Commander Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war camps at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to peace in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States won the fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain
One day after she shot three doors during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American Feldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five towers in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember what they had ever done.
"I don't know." she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.
However, they know this: Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic War and are at the same time in their group with the British in the first place to remain unarmed after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet together on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both men have already qualified for the fourth final, the game will be decided which of the two members of their group from six teams will achieve the first and second place each.
The first place will take the strong Dutch people a little longer away from the way they lead the other group.
As the game may always go out on Saturday, the Americans have solved a surprising puzzle through their success history, four years after they landed in the last 12 places in London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years had a hockey player in her hands (two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She replaced the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the framework.
Then came the year 2012, in which she and her team were all set up.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an English trainer of the National Team, began to make things better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the pension in London, which we now have.
We've been able to climb the wheel completely.
On Thursday afternoon, Bam opened the torreigs in the first half of the game with a back-hand from the neighborhood.
If there was no victory in the tournament, but the team showed a surprising sound and held the play from 1 to 0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She filled out a sprint with the flat ball over the left bottle, then went into the middle and ran the ball into the tower to get the Americans a 2-0 guide.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final tower in the middle of the last quarter.
The shoutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. Torhuterin, Jackie Briggs, who had to hide a tower in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good it will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the line of the Olympics, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are as late as it is, there are the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and irreconcilable, a crucial stage between competition and competition.
It is as if the Olympic Fackel himself would be a burning stick, which will be reached from the armchair protection to the turning to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the waiting language in the coffee shop without listening to about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the struggle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is the first time in the Olympic Games and is a woman's dress with graffiti, could have been through these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and welfare TV advertising, if he was a sweater, tournament or even a fatter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampolin tournaments about gold.
The Olympic flame does not shine at all.
Other from the center, partly in the shadow, are the types of sports that are not generally recognized: Air gunships, Bogen boots, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the fresco, and we'll be able to overcome it for a long time.
But if I have to make some arguments for my particular favorite, then let me focus on the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampolin spring has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been taken so seriously over the past 16 years that many of those I have asked did not know that it is a type of Olympic sport.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States athletes have never won a medal in the trampolin jumps and until 2012 they have had an athlete who has won it to the end.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for men and Chinese and Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampolin spring has a certain outdoor charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic games.
At this point, I should say that I am not an expert, but only an interconnected enthusiast.
It has a humorous potential - the cardio-capable lemons of its desire never to end with a pleasing awakening - but also the thanks of the tournament and baptisms, the two types of sports it combines in essence.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "Springboard."
The winning winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to have a series of falling movements (drives, Hechten and Saltos) before they land on their feet.
They will be evaluated according to an official Olympic program after the execution, the degree of difficulty and the "flight time".
Two-thirds of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are represented in Rio.
The common Olympic vector is just right.
In their pursuit, medallifiers must go on to gold, faster, faster, higher and higher, sometimes to the goal, sometimes to go back and forth, to the top and down on the playing field.
They are not only the destinations or the beginnings, but also a higher goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympics.
The targeted pursuit is noble, wonderful, even fanatical - and it is enough to drive even a visitor to train.
But it's also what I feel like when I watch these games myself.
The trampoline offers an atemployment.
The vector of the trampoline spring is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she's going off, seemingly as hard as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then unable to go up again.
There is also a competition here, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no Hektic attack on the target, no wood in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It's just like competition in the Olympics.
The women's qualifications and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13 a.m.
NBC will be released as part of a afternoon block from 14 a.m. on two days.
In the middle of the Olympics, they promise a quiet, quiet moment, one that is likely to be seen in general tumult.
If awareness-raising can only be achieved through the announcements and the targeting of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tourner suggests in The Wall Street Journal shortly - then Mr. Dooley expects his air-circuit new prisoner.
"A Generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a United States connector
Powerful Protests in Ethiopia
Democrats who call for political changes in Ethiopia support the government's violent opposition.
Witnesses said that during the meeting with the police, protestors were killed in exchanges.
Is Ethiopia just going to break up with it?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid link between the West and a rapidly growing economy.
But in the last few months, protest against the government has spread to more and more areas.
In the last week, thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response was inconceivable to human rights organizations.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.
In the process, videos about the Protestants that are probably from the last or beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The Head of the United Nations Human Rights Authority is now requesting a thorough investigation.
"It has been increasingly difficult to maintain this country and will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most prosperous country in Africa, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat earthquakes outside the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western help.
Ethiopia's economy expanded during the period considered.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendler train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to pressure the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, where dissidents have been effectively brought to the country.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or sent to the length of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and these no other options are to protest, it turns out," said Seyoum Teshome, a dozen in Central Asia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protested.
There are a number of complaints that cover all of the land use to the extent of the invasion of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last sitting of the opposition and now controls 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions along the border of Eritrea increased; a struggle for this delicate, conflicting line required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts feared that separatists, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who had been more or less forced in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.
A number of factors explain why the feeling of abstinence is now exploding in front of the surface.
The first seems unharmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have there been a lot of Ethiopian people who have been able to communicate social media, since cheap smartphones have become increasingly popular and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government restricts access to Facebook and Twitter, which they regularly do, especially in the case of Protestants, many people can still communicate via Internet-proxies that hide where they stand.
Several young Ethiopians claimed that they were gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not a natural enemy.
Since the beginning, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia too Christian heights, have advanced in politics and economics, as they have conquered the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that also changes.
"We are about to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have felt that Ethiopia will be dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tiger, who make up around 6 per cent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in secret services, in trade and in politics.
The third reason for sleep is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, an ex-rebellious leader, had been a minister of Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of eggs.
Analysts say that he was particularly involved in making early signs of discontent and using special tasks to deal with enemies and to make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic message," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict-tanalitic.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively undisputed reasons to adopt the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the tigers.
Many feared that the result would be more blood loss.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an outbreak in 2005, thousands protested against elections, which appeared to have been destroyed and subsequently stolen by the government, according to reports of analysts.
During the following raids, many protestors were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of rest went relatively fast.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visional infrastructure plan, such as the new pendler train, as well as their modest progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal mistrust of the Ethiopian government.
And she's taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protestors in Gondar, an amharic city, were arrested by Tigray and the Hass against the Tigray is always common in the social media.
Analysts say the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into their own position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across the neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently reported that it had closed this base.
While it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to be united in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin graffiti."
Donald Trump explains his opinion Obama has established ISIS since being "Sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to disrupt the last controversy surrounding his campaign by claiming that his repeated arrest, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Presidential candidacy of the Republicans whether he could communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.
It also brings his opponent, who strives to protect him during an evental phase, in the actual position, to explain statements he could not even mention.
After he had made the announcement at a midweek election event, Mr. Trump turned his attention to the arrest on Thursday and held in interviews that he was not really interested, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he was simply shakastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he considered the charge to be completely serious.
When Conservative Radio Moderator Hugh Hewitt Trump wanted to help Mr. Trump to make a mistake by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wanted to destroy, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of the criticism was on Mr. Trump, while he tried to link the focus of his campaign because of falling back on the economy.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump once again tried to return to this subject.
Looking over Twitter, he warned that Mr. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech long ago.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he was critical when he thought that the Russians should attack Mr. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I mean the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries into politics and then, when necessary, to redefine them.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received from his fans, how they arrive, and then, if appropriate, "to clarify" the reaction." Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, observed the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is smart enough to keep his statements pretty well enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways and ways.
Instead of withdrawing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump adopted an even more impressive tone, as his requisitions continued.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with great influence in the federal states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-and-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocations, he often accuses his critics of concealing his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while strengthening his attention during the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal Mittreiters to stand up to him, regardless of how his statements might cause him.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's prominent speakers, was very pleased to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
In this sense it is true that before Obama ISIS was a almost unknown, small organization, he called her interbankers, completely wrong and that's why he took the troops out of Iraq.
Most Mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government of Obama, in Mr Clinton's office as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand by letting them take control of the situation in the Middle East.
Before the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and urged them to return to each of his words and to be taken up against him.
He raised the "army, sympathetic" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats argued about Mr. Trump's apology as just another evidence that he was inappropriate for the Presidency.
First over the market price, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a famous coffee in Williamsburg, where you could only pay bar, which had no Wi-Fi, but served a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were frozen.
The Soap Cherie, the verb replaced in summer 2014, sells Sife in the form of Cupcakes.
Locals treated it as the last loss in a city that was gentrifying.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB will exclude the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a ship business."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a recovery.
A reopened verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar bad atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old Café, the owner and manager of the new Café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outpost, he was reluctant to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, has a lot to do with.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He brought in new ingredients.
On the food map there are sandwiches with specks and cheeses and there are garages such as capers and satisfactory biscuits.
There's natural tourism exchanges.
The Café serves no more beer, there are fresh seeds for it.
After nine months Rodriguez said he noticed a steady flow of old-fashioned customers.
"Many old customers were also overwhelmed by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb had been closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I was made clear that it was in coffee and in the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if this day she replaces her usual Iced Coffees with a blended tea, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been a more longtime and trusted customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there in front of the work and ordered without delay Dasselbe.
"I came to the fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss cupcake and they prepared my everything with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bag with scotch, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't mention that the ship business took over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie set up to make a special cup of verb with the cold-brown coffee of the coffee as a juice.
"I think we're still going to join her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the Café.
A new customer has translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said that he has to take it out immediately so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.
The location also has further precedents.
A local soft spot wants to fill in and sell the cold brown coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the coffee spreads on a nearby building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a native customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the coffee was closed.
When the new coffee opened, White said that the presence of the local and the order felt a new coffee like a home trip.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressed food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal time"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a Feinschmecker, President Roosevelt had a weakness for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de fee gras and Maryland Water Children's Cracks.
His menu on this day was something remarkable: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes and as a dessert a flower pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" was produced by the Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a home in the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest collaboration, "A convenient meal", which will appear on the Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop on the evenings, a small, fast-noble Imbis in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Börsencrash 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive slices, while Coe, 57, Truthahhn with cardofelpurie and mixing.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this couple found suitable for a discussion on the food in the era of great depression.
"The rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was an earthquake, a fever, and a bohnen bronchitis.
They were prepared from a fruit and something cheap, which cuts the fruit.
Be willing to eat so many vegetables that they serve them as evenings.
Coe greenest.
"It must have been in the stomach like lightning," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet.
Women's men bought for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastats for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hundreds of Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" marks the way the country is moving towards no longer being the slag country.
"It was a time when the American food became a central, exciting topic," Coe said, "and why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was also challenging: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became essential food to reevaluate the casseroles as "a wonderful species, food residues," observed Ziegelman, as kitchens could hide unappetuous ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying fruit.
The meat, which has been the center of the American cuisine for many years, has been a rarely served luxury.
Self-examinations were tested because there was a cool and comfortable relaxation prior to taste or even healthy kitchen understanding.
During their search for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this era, with baffled drums with earthnus butter.
"There was no popular addendum on the afternoon," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Groundnut butters and groundnuts don't match each other.
It was typical for many of the households.
As never before or since, budget farmers, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943, are doing so in the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and journals, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and to be entitled to the challenge of changing potatoes, such as creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical healings.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungering citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung.
While publicly celebrating the simple Iowa Farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he eats like the millions of men of the world to which he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with gorken sauce," said Coe.
He was in a close-fashioned dining room and took a snack.
He was very real.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not invited him to set an example with his mother.
As described in the book, the host of a housekeeper with no interest in taste directions by Mrs. Roosevelt led the white house to produce the longest food in Washington, but also one of the most reliable preparations."
Many of the species from the age of the great depression to go through with food were destroyed as soon as the country came back to its feet.
The idea lies on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's foster mother - for example, how they could not remove food.
"She had a real fear of the abuse of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: "They actually made people sick."
There was a wind storm.
After the tellers had been out at Eisenberg's, they and Coe were looking for a dessert that they had prepared at home: the flowering dessert, President Roosevelt at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to replace certain recipes with a real name.
There were no dried salts, only flowers, some honey, sugar, water and lemon.
Everyone had something strange to fall into the thin, brown glibber.
Suddenly, it didn't hurt.
Coe three times had a seizure.
As a Can-Do-Budgeter said to his wife, "A few hacked Walnuts would help."
Killed by a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
The 30-year-old himself died in a phase bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets" civil protection group, which, according to image vision, has saved nearly 60,000 lives.
2600 Volunteers put their own lives on the game to get people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian protector who showed him in an 11-hour rescue of a sage from the roofs of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a light symbol in the glory of the war.
But when Hellen never saw herself, he said, "This is the true Jihad for me."
"When I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself had an attack on the victim, he had spoken in a video about the latest bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters fired four fass bombs over the Alzadia area, one filled with chlorgas.
A woman and two children die, seven people suffer at Atemnot.
"We now destroy the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children don't play it," says the picture his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to have hit terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest virbel animal is almost 400 years old
Seltener Look.
Grönlandhaie comes mostly in winter to the surface.
After an investigation on the board of the research ship Sanna returned to the sea.
He was born in 1624 and is swimming well with a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland has only grown up in 150 years.
At the same time, Greenlandhai swims along the north-east Atlantic, within an hour it reaches an average of 1,220 metres.
Only when it gets there, the five-metre-long animal speeds on sate 2,6 km/h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a robbe.
This long-term lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent concept for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenlandhai, which could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, comments on these life spans, which means a world record for wild animals.
However, Evolution biologists have long been convinced that Greenland will be rocked.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland Haie is difficult to observe, and eventually they live mainly in the ice before the densely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually rise in the surface only in the winter.
Researchers know little about the life-style of Greenland alone.
Their timing is measured when they equipped six animals at the top of the mountain with a messenger.
In spite of this fact, researchers found the rest of a robot in the stomach of an animal, another had hit the fingernails of a young eagle.
It is possible that they hunt sleeping animals or patrolling on the shores of the ice and search for the kadavar, which flows from higher water vessels to the bottom.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland haie, the fishermen were taken from the depths of the North Atlantic before 2010 to 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest hai was only 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimeter measured.
In order to detect the age of animals, they analyzed the lynchers of the liver using the carbon-14 method.
This centre of the eyeline is already created before the birth of the liver, which contains proteins, which are no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the linsenkers.
Therefore, her birth should be after the early 1960s, when the nuclear weapons test would lead to greater amounts of this radioactive fuel in the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the case of a minimum of 220 centimetres of the smallest animal, the Lenskers included a small surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 in its investigation.
On the other hand, all the larger Greenland Heaths had normal carbon-14 quantities produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the 14-hour carbon watch for a 493-centimeter-long Greenlandhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record-Hai should be even 392 years old.
That Greenlandhai Webbchen was known for growing up only when they were more than four feet long.
Now the researchers of the length were able to predict an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres is likely to stand on the threshold and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland hae is apparently at least half a century old.
This should also be a world record for wild animals today.
This is not an accident.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, also caught a 120-year-old harpoon speck on his nose, was arrested before Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on spar flame.
So you're getting older later - and older.
In addition, to keep warm in cold water, animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal heats.
Therefore, the heat loss of a gram mouse is much larger than that of a gram elephant.
Another advantage: You have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many futures as possible early as possible," explains the Evolution Biology Scheuerlein.
However, a very large animal should invest its resources in a longer life.
Background in double-pack
With the theme of the building, the House of Commons has taken a heavy toll at the recent meeting.
With ease, the company took note of the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin".
After clarification of the basics, partial and settlement questions and the applications could be made on a margin, the sale of the basics in the residential areas of "stretchlög" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße Area - Development Section 1) is no longer in the way of stakeholders.
The community council is convinced that the buildings in the rural and quiet residential area of Schönau address young families as well as hardworking seniors.
As it has said, construction workers can immediately report to the Council, which will hopefully be consulted by the Council at its September meeting.
In addition, in order to be able to meet requests for the participation of other companies associated with the creation of jobs, the Council decided to amend the area-use plan set up by this year first in the spring of this year in part areas.
Thus, in the area of periodicals, the area already identified is extended to two parcels of State road 2112.
Frankfurt benefited from Brexit
The city of Main then has the best opportunities in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to attract lost jobs and companies from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit volume," says Michael Voigtlander, director of the field of competence of the IW’s financial markets and real estate markets.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is unknown whether households can continue to operate from London for financial purposes throughout the EU.
To date, the EU passport is available to them in Britain.
That's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced to reduce jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt Main Finance" calculates 10,000 new jobs in Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities, such as the EIOPA and the ESRB risk account, is shared by the European Central Bank.
While in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its main position, this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The approach to the note bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says Professor Voigtlande.
Although Luxembourg is a large fund industry, it also cuts down as much as Dublin's infrastructure.
Frankfurt would be much easier to reach with thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easily available commercial furniture.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," Voigtlander says.
In addition, the rents for first-class business furniture were 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and lower criminality.
In a range of company advice Mercer, the city is located seven times, Luxembourg is 19, Dublin is located 33 times and Paris is 37.
Even if the quality of life is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial position for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW continues.
But London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit Votum, which I believe is the economic researchers.
In addition, there are strong relations: in London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba End 2015 about 144,000 people in the banking industry, there were 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent with Merck
A U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has claimed the reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a damage tax of $200 million for the destruction of two Merck patents, which were associated with the blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. director discovered a pattern of misconduct on the market, including mine and other unethical actions.
When the complaint was filed on Thursday, U.S. Director Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had claimed the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to compare with Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back in 2013, when Gilead and Merck claimed to be jointly informed and owned on laboratory work, based on Sofosbuvir, the active substance in the medicinal products of Gilead.
US-supported troops say they have regained full control of Manbie from the Islamic state again.
A speaker of the group on Friday said, after the last ISIS fighters left the city, the total control over the northern city of Manbi was restored to the Turkish border by the US troops supported by the United States.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) were defeated after the exodus of the remaining groups of fighters who had buried themselves within the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as hostages, Sharfan Darwish shared with the DKS- bound manby military Reuters.
"The city is now under full control, but we are just doing space work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned 10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax declaration for 2015 on Friday, which provided for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and their husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons USD 1 million for well-being purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton generated fast USD 5.3 million in Redehonorage; the former Foreign Minister introduced an income of USD 3 million from the Verlag Simon & Schuster for her book about her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, published his tax statements with his wife Anne Holton for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and returns in respect of his previous contracts to publish his tax declarations.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not required by law for this purpose.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're at the train," wrote Mr. Clinton's electoral assistant, Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Tromps Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax checks were completed.
Trump Criticker, including the Republican presidential candidate for the year 2012, in mid-2012, has already allowed his refusal to raise questions about wealth, his spending on charitable organizations, his business opportunities and various other connections, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already been involved in the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday, demanding his tax release in the high-ranking Republican Trump.
On Thursday she also discussed the subject during a talk on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements."
Politicians have reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s for two years, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers who claimed that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a scheme known as the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election event for Hillary Clinton in the past week in Omaha, Nebraska asked Buffet, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has its seat to exchange Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also subject to a tax test by the IRS and Trump had an "angst" before the voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published a tax declaration back until 2007.
Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax statement showed that they refer only to USD 100 of their income as a loan, other than the majority of all Americans.
Its main cash facility was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clintons dividends and revenues of USD 109.000 were charged.

Condoms with Chilipuder, promote fireworks bodies Tanzania's elephant protection
Natural protectionists in Tanzania use an unorthodox type to prevent elephants from going into dwellings inhabited by people - they throw condoms on those who are filled with chilippers.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had already taken the idea years ago, has intensified its promotion with the US Nature Protection, by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, to use a violent four-stage method to protect their houses and heritage without harming animals.
Before, many birds have been used to protect themselves.
Friday is the day of the world's telefantant, dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe within these communities a change in their attitude, where they are much more likely to stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said the business leader of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a falcon and the glass in a horn.
If he's not fired, a so-called Chiliwolke will be fired.
Chilipuder combined with the earth is packed with a fire-works body in a condom, whose end is drawn to the sinister core.
When it is announced, the condom opens with a button and pours fine dust into the air at Chilipider.
A hauch is usually already in order to defeat the elephants.
A last possibility is a propeller that shoots a gold mine into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Street decided unanimously: No kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goarer's investment projects of business operators with Kusshand - but only the individual trade in the city is considered to be clearly reliable.
The request for a new shop at the railway station in the immediate vicinity of the railway station in the building, however, was now urgent.
"In principle, we welcome new businessmen, but at this site in a exposed position on the Rheinufer this kiosk does not fit," Michael Hubrath explained for the CDU fraction.
Jewish Director Deploys Berlin Hotel, because Israel's choice was removed after "arabic" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots issued a media tour after he had reported that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not registered an Israeli election, since it was said that an Arab guest had "needed."
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust "Shoah" document, released his doctors at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not registered among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible to remove and delete Israel in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call centre.
After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel manager said the measure was a "subject decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
The reason that was down was that more clouds were released in the director's office.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election be deleted," was quoted by Lanzmann's employee.
The Israeli messenger in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman described this as a "great shame", reports the South German newspaper.
We were shocked and frightened by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has become available in Germany in this exact hotel chain is even more serious.
No explanation is required.
We expect the hotel "the right conclusions," said the officer.
The incident solved a very large resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have given the alleged demands of Arab guests "if they did."
In another entry, it was pointed out that the hotel, which is located at the noble curfürstämm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the accusations of himself and announced the incident a "see" and "accused" at Lanzmann, reports The mirror.
"There has never been a direct instruction," Israel did not get into the quicklist," the South German newspaper quoted a spokesman from the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preference has now been added.
Police arrests Trenengas & Gummi-shosse against protesting Brazilian students
The students joined the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police set up trains and rubber shells against the demonstrators.
The difficulties arise when police officers tried to separate the students, leading to the use of rubber and trenegas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in demonstrations to express their appreciation for the plans.
According to the proposal of the Government of the state of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be converted to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffitits against the former President Michel Temer on the wall.
The youngest Protestants arrived a few days after demonstrators in mass went on the streets to support the suspended President, Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended by a vote of the Senate on their resignation from the office.
Trade between Russia & Iran is gradually increasing to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, the Russian messenger in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, grew by 70.9 per cent in the annual balance of trade between Moscow and Tehran.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has increased strongly, the messenger shared with them.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, the further development of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, the Russian imports in Iran rose by 91.5 percent and accounted for $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade promotion has been achieved through the delivery of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the messenger.
Dzhagaryan leaves a record of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year the Russian abroad represented some 35,000 Visas, first on the line of travel, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the records of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken since last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the messenger hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received the monuments of old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Testimonials sought: Overcrowding of the drinking market in forest brül
A robbery took place on the Donnerstagbend on the wine market of Rewe XXL at the forest brüller Gerberstraße.
In the presence of a shooting gun, three people who had washed their faces asked for the release of bar money from the wine market and then jumped on foot, perhaps with a silver-coloured VW floor.
How much money was spent, the police don't share it.
The reactors should be large between 1,60 and 1,70 meters, so relatively small.
The drinking market is immediately accessible and badly visible from the Rewe market park.
After the crash at Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, the workers must have fled from the parking lot with the silver-coloured car, possibly in direction B 256 (schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time (at 19.45 p.m.) that are related to the accident should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer time
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social pedagogical group/social working group of the Child Protection League Nagold with their caregivers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Müläcker.
In the peaceful holiday home, the happy group was included during the first week of school.
Several full-time flights were on the program.
To one, it went to Brits with the visit of the stringelzoos.
On the other side of Maulbronn, where there was a special birth control in the world-famous monastery.
The third flight led to Pforzheim.
In the Kelten Museum in Hochdorf, the group has a lot to learn about the daily and the food of the hills.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which called for Springs, Swimmings and Planches.
Children and caregivers with their own prepared live parts such as the Saureen Spätzle, the seabroner Pfänle, the Isleshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful pieces of pearl and stone were created or made from wood a Roman-Müle game.
Further points of freedom were the angels in a closet, the evenings in the fire and the final "Bunte evening".
On the day of the journey, the sun and the children and young people were happy to be home.
Haigerlog: Pilgrims for the sake of mercy
The ministers from Eyachtal-Haigerlog St. Anna were on their way to a four-day pilgrimage from Willingen to Freiburg.
Together, four steps were handled.
In order to spend the time up to the next Romwald trip of all ministers in the expected two years, the Chief Minister round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day Pillar migration.
Various Wall Street destinations were examined and finally decided for the Bishop's town of Freiburg, where this year, at the Holy Year of Barnness with the privileges of mercy opened at Freiburger Münster, a special Pilgeral objective was offered this year.
16 Miniatures from bittel-bronts, gruols, hygerlogs, and holy rooms made themselves on the way.
The night before, Pfarer Stoorst sent the Pilger out in a small party in St. Anna, followed the Pilger Cross and told the Pilgers.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Willingen, where there is also a monster of Our Love Woman and thus the Pilgerway was taken by the Munster.
Each morning and evening, the individual day trips were surrounded by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.
But, on the other hand, the minis at field circles, chapels or churches were always ready to sing a song of their own combined Pilger band.
For the nights, each pharmacovigilance room of the local pharmacovigilance is available.
At the stage, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi offered a tasteful meal as well as a strengthening evening and breakfast.
On the second day, it went on to Güttenbach.
The day after St. Peter’s departure, which was the most intense route, the stage had to begin at a high altitude of about 500 feet [500 m] and then be re-examined again.
In the evening, the prize was a common cry at Badweiher.
After the morning of the fourth Pilger day in the imposing monastery of St. Peter, it went to the castle stop to Freiburg.
The minis met in the late afternoon at Freiburger Münster and crossed the gates of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening meeting in Münster, the ministers of Cooper Markus Obert, who came to the Pilger, were welcomed.
After the service of God, the Pilgrims were able to visit the Sacristians and the Hochaltars.
The next day, it was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
The next day it went back by train to Horb.
In conclusion, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were a thing of the past.
Shooting Callum Skinner comes home when Brite Gold for riding sports
Schottlands Callum Skinner last night at the men's team Sprint in Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the role of the Andersmann Sir Chris Hoy, who made himself his own. The young pund made the legend proud when he went home to hide a victory from the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy held the fifth of six Olympic medals.
They resumed the trick after they held only a small sixth place in London in March at the World Championships in London despite the return trip Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this right away as a Hindu.
Hoys peace created a mistake that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man she stayed with when she saw potential in the shot that just happened.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinners set an Olympic score in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes left his round button back, but Kenny brought the team forward and took it away.
A strategic change resulted in a large part of the transformation that led to the obstacle in a higher race to pursue it and to enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to maintain the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as BBC experts and fell skinners, Kenny and Hindus when they got up on the podest.
The 23-year-old glassman said, "It's a beautiful comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have set up an Olympic record in the final round and won the world champion.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindus suggested that he fell on the train with a weak start.
He later returned this statement, and there was no objection from England's Rivalen.
There was no such problem this time with such an amazing victory.
He said, "It feels like all the GB flags on the tribune like London."
We've been together in the last three months as a team.
We're so bad at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that has won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London.
If it's a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we're expected to be successful five days in Velodroom.
With the form of Kennys it is in the area of the possibility that He won Hoys' victory over three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - means a feast of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the same thing from Hoy.
Kenny takes the next part in the Sprint, which starts today and goes over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team operation is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be shot at the knight."
It was the only media competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doul qualified for the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.
They reached 3:51,942 on target.
The world record, won in 2012 in London Gold, was at 3:51,659.
The first and final rounds (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, with the wiggins will stand in the focus.
He argued with officers yesterday before the qualification when he was called by his staff to measure his body size.
In the respective women's competition, which will continue and be completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavia advanced at 4:13,260.
The GB team relys on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic games and take a sword to medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute Dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were raised.
It played dramas in the background, thus the return of technical leader Shane Sutton in April between sexism and motivation and the rest of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the competition in Velodrom, it seems quite clear that the current false call of GBs, which has reached its peak for the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland's Schmelzeeri due to the suspension of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland's aluminium smelt in Victoria - as well as the hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake as the plant operator announces the energy contract and thus cancels all supply contracts, as announced by the energy company.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A grant established for 20 years runs out in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be dangerous at a conclusion.
In addition, it could result in domino effect, as the schmelzeeri consumes around 10 per cent of the total electricity production Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa concluded the point Henry Schmelzeeri, which led to the conclusion of the Anglo-Sea force plant last year.
Alcoa's shellage in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the year-long speculation about the future of the plant, originally due to the strong Australian dollar and the latter due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which provides the large aluminium shell with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, explained that it is because three other owners will announce their contracts.
The facility is in the majority possession of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubine Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means another physical demand by electricity through the Schmelzeeri," the company shared.
AGL further stated that the contracts referred to as "safety business" should have entered into force since November 2016.
The Treaties have a 12-month deadline of termination so that they will be concluded in 2017.
"Therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the adoption in the 17th business year," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on AGL revenue from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasting of the strong thermal markets for wholesale prices.
AGL reported that it had already signed the value of the contracts in its annual budget of $187 million in "Assessing a fine".
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts, "The ability to operate Alcoas... the thresholds or to provide electricity to the thresholds" did not affect.
The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year-old contract with Lloyd Yang that would have been in force since November this year, even if it is still a valid explanation why it was withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn against the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzeeri in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In connection with the statement of the analyst at the beginning of the week, the head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
Should both facilities be removed from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [Strom market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as electricity generators," he said.
More than just a Cardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and four daughters of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Genner Clans Kriss is on the cover of the popular September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand messenger of Estee Lauder and loved the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris, and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love brought me the look of this cover to wine," wrote Kendall.
The discovery of the cover followed a strange (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians like?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Genner family (with the exception of the cases of Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forgot their sister's cover and end with a classic version: they all planned a surprise party.
This appears to be almost every birthday period of a child's birth (Seacrest brought the sentence, "Do you think we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a sign-cracker at a post station about 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kristi had to let her other girls participate in this publication anywhere.
In view of the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Cardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim may have shot what the Vogue-Cover is doing (she and her husband Kanye West were watching it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a liga for themselves.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
With a range that resembles an image band rather than a fashion magazine, the issue has a large number of players (as far as Fashionista was from the 832 pages of the Wäller 615 pages advertising).
The completion of its Coverstars is expected to ensure that in the last two years, images of the magazine have been secured before official recognition.
Women who were already on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In the last few years, there has been clearly more "primary values, the models" than "models, the reputations" on the cover.
Oscar priest and Dior Marken Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the slightest chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described in the magazine as the "use model" of her generation - is in the former category, she is in good company.
These reputations are not connected to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything comes to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course Jenners likes success, not everyone.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the model world was always something exciting.
In June, Victoria's only secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticized Victoria's secret model and called it "the myth of the moment."
These feelings were bought up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to go beyond the point to go back to the missmut.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the seventh edition of the Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your founding of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of her made by Cindy Crawford's daughter at the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time, she is to see on reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kurtney and their children.
Community law centres show 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's eligible beneficiaries will be awarded annually by the Community legal centres, while the industry will focus on the effects of further media cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, there are already three of five persons - most older persons, immigrants, auxiliary workers, victims of violence and those who do not have any means for unfair delegation and similar - when seeking free legal advice and enforcement.
Legal services of the Community which have already been overloaded will be made available for further reductions.
In June the next year, it is expected that these legal centres will lose 30 per cent of their federal resources.
The Director of the Community Law Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that the last collection of the National Union of Community Law Centres resulted in thousands of people being dismissed every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only be worse without a suspension of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's Community Law Centres are chronically sub-financed, which means that thousands of people of important services you need are denied," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with excessive and oppressive debt, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of legal nature and this collection shows that they can't get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce the funds by 30 per cent, which means that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to face their legal problems without any help.
We urge the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to step up these media cuts so that people can receive the help they need to deal with legal problems.
Last year the Government of the country fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to see the needs of the Community legal centres and their customers, and that the Palašzuk government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump Election Campaign accused after employees claimed to use weapons
New York: Donald Trumps Campaign was accused of the alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February had placed a gun on a staff member while they were in a jeep on their way in February.
The case is described in a letter of complaint filed on Wednesday at Charlotte's national court by Vincent Boroni, a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state.
Boroni agreed to wait months for the matter to be settled within before he realized that "that wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "took a gun, put his right finger on the trigger, and broke the run in Vincent's neck," Boroni appealed in his complaint.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini concluded that at least four other people had done the same experience with Phillip.
"The weapons must not be fired to repair damage," Boroni said.
The complaint is only two days after the Republican Presidential Candidacy, when he told a number of people in North Carolina that the "second Amendment People" - the gun owners and armed friends - should take action if Rivalin Hillary Clinton is elected and the judges should be appointed.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had removed his words from the context and that he would not attack him for violence.
Boronis Complaint requires damages from the campaign for the destruction of the care obligation and from Philip because of physical damage and remaining physical damage.
Trumps Press Speaker Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local reporter in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
On calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, no response was received.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has previously led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is carried out by Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-13300, Oberstes Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Question before country elections: lose SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the government's SPD and CDU parties were incurred.
This presented representative questions from the INSA Institute of Opinions for the "Image" Zeitung (Freeday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely manage, this is not possible after the polls in Berlin.
In both German countries, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good opportunities to continue to put the Head of State.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 per cent five years ago to 24 per cent.
The party therefore claims that the question is only a little bit ahead of the CDU, which could come again to 23%.
The third place is between the left and the left.
The link reached 19 per cent (up to 18.4 per cent), which would have represented 19 per cent of the country's first day.
The greens, despite lower losses, increase by 6 per cent (up to 8.7 per cent) in the harsher country day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent on the country's day.
In the Berlin poll, only 23 per cent of the survey was followed by the SPD (2011: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent.
It is still behind the greens with 19 per cent (2011: 17.6 per cent), but before the links with 15 per cent (formerly 11.7 per cent).
The AfD would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the House of Commons.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope to return, however, the Pirates would have missed their entry in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicationor came to the market.
The following dominate today the world’s manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand either.
On the other hand, it was quite blind.
The built-in memory initially consisted of eight megabytes, which would be sufficient today for about two Selfies with a high resolution.
An iPhone is currently delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come from anywhere from the time of the internet time.
20 years ago, however, the communicationer was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer-measuring Cebit in Hannover as "Office in West-Westtown format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of text messages and e-mails for those standards, even by fax the communicationer was to be reached.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, even if it was relatively slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be attacked like a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black white screen appeared.
The price was extremely proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392 in 2015.
No one could know in August 1996 that the communicationator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then everything's different.
The sound phones are a success story even though not for Nokia.
The phone department of the find experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and developed at Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers who all came back to Nokia a long time later.
Always be online, this is today for many people every day.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple were sold in only 555 million pieces.
The worldwide turnover of the equipment is around 400 billion euros.
To this end, the well-run businesses of the payless app providers and the telecommunications companies come.
Around the smartphone was created between a whole industry.
The decisive use of the mass market began in early 2007, when Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communications provider, to easily use everything via touch screen.
The victory of Apple has begun, yet today the iPhone is the most important product of the company.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who controlled the market, had the following.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The words now have apples and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-evident 20 years after its discovery.
In the meantime, every German today looks at his phone between 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to remove the smartphone even once," said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff in Siemens.
Permanent availability is at the same time as flight and victory.
England has to link the Olympic spirit and increase Heathrow
Heathrow will not only be brought into our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity.
For me, this was the largest Heathrows attraction, just as in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will only create 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and prepare for the end of youth unemployment in the airport.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be such ones who will think that the challenge of extending Heathrows is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be cursed on the world stage.
The two were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180.000 new jobs, £211 billion on scientific growth and to leave a wealth of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a $11 billion thines infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - the five years following the world's best airport terminal, to T2, which was built between the two most frequent stages of the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third run, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments.
The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to align this Olympic spirit with Heathrow as well as ensure our future trade and create a sense of skill and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is president of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz-and- Mouse" show-blocking
For companies who earn money online, according to one of the software manufacturer's attempts to turn display blockades, a cat and mouse game is equal.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block their social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads in order to make it difficult to recognise the recognition of which part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to change the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-her-combat between the show-blocking Open Source Community and the environment has been running since the discovery of advertising blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how the industry has become alarmingly blocked.
Worldwide, according to a recent study by Page Fair and Adobe, about 200 million people are active in advertising, almost four times as many as in 2013.
With 1,03 billion active users daily accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, phone calls make 84% of Facebook subscribers.
The company has looked at ads blockers on desktop PCs, since mobile ads blockers have no effect on Facebook mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, a speaker shared with them.
Advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue, so Facebook appears to invest in such a step as wage value.
On Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its "Preferencing Tool" to give people more control over their intended advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would take care of new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising.
"For the user, there is no positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook speaker shared with him in an e-mail message.
Showers are a dumb medium, why we have focused instead on development tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
To pass a woman on possible suicide on the Swiss highway
The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.
The police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a car on Thursday morning at a possible suicide of several vehicles.
The event occurred shortly after midnight near the A1 in the canton of Waadt.
A woman stood on the street in the dark "in an act of doubt" and was hit by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss man of 49 years of age, who was transferred from several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She's still dead in front of her place.
Several drivers have already been taken, but some have not yet been identified, the police, who called on these and any witnesses of the case to report.
A detection procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, told Gilles Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected if one of the drivers is shown.
Was a concordance inevitable?
That's something the government lawyer has to decide," said Hofstutter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not taken into account.
In each of the two cases - in which a person loved in the darkness on the road - it was decided that the drivers should not depart from the fact that a passenger walks in the middle of the night on the road, as it did in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released after she passed over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 night near Payeren in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court took.
The court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency -- acted in a just and fair way and that the presence of a man on the street was an "extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has any further information about the event on Thursday near morning should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was first viable
The Venus was probably the first to live in the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dtained atmosphere could have provided the ideal conditions.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus may have had a thin, mindful atmosphere and still slowed down.
The model also shed light on the topography of the early Venus.
The planet may have seen more dry areas than the earth, but it had enough water and geographical variability to save life and protect against rapid confusion.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus reflects its sun's day page for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a rainscreen to remove the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than the earth is today.
The model highlighted a story of Venus that resembles Evolution, which was previously inspired by planetary research.
Although it was probably inhabited at first, the Venus -- over many billions of years -- was exposed to heat and ultraviolet light.
Her oceans were clouded and her water pump was burned from ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogens evolved, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know as they are today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy comes back as trainer of the Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy took the position of trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and brought back a very low degree of co-decision in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the Union will be immediately looking for a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as chief coach and Vice President Of Hockey's operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
I've been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth, what it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of trainers and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with the organization.
He must also have a right to co-ordination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who had hosted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick has informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and want him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the winner of Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the League during his Debux season in the 2013-14 Avalanches.
He led the union to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was shot in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota and replaced the next season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded 39-39-4 brands in the 2015-16 season and fall behind the wild for a second Wildcard Spot in the Western Conference at five points.
As Hall of Fame Tourart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, put out the strike
The work force on wages for North Sea oil workers is suspended while all parties to the table set up a new round of talks.
Strings against the oil service provider Wood Group were conducted on track on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the units and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to start the process of relaunching the current conflict," it is in a joint statement.
We are going to stop some full-time meetings in the coming weeks, the beginning of the next year to tackle the problems again.
The trade unions said that her last strike, which was the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible rewards of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut the Councils to its contractors in the North Sea about 9 per cent this year because of negative market pressure.
The company's rate acceleration is followed by a 10-percent decrease for Onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts to the company had the space needed to come through the market fluctuation.
Shell has released thousands of people for his part and announced plans to set up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business as a result of its mega-link with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower raw materials prices, an economic situation that was strengthened by the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Parliamentary Member Dave Anderson met this week with employers to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that has taken place since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not only for little," he said in a statement.
2016 is less than $1.4 billion in expenditure for new projects in the North Sea compared to average around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler misss the rotation rate of stars in the star range of the Plejaden
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational cycles under the stars of the Star House of Plejades.
The new data help the astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the star range and how the rotation times are connected to the planet's axis.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other starlights, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star gate of the Plejaden is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this starhouse, which were created about 125 million years ago, are now the age of growth.
They're moving fast now.
On top rotation rates, these powerful stars stood out of large amounts of star wins.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star is older, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler loses the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a visible star flash -- such as sunflake.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that larger stars are slower than less mass stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, where larger stars rotate longer pirates as smaller.
"In the "Balllet" of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more intense, though faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the starship of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmetic laboratory to compare stable qualities like rotation rates.
"The starhouse of the Plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stealer rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still much ahead of us we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars interfere with their rotational rates and thus stop their "dansks".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejaden, which will soon appear in the Astronomic Journal.
A distorted Baseball star is coming from
The trains live at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US Baseball Star in the best days of base to base.
Following his emotional return release, the 41-year-old profie will be the last time the tripod of his New York Yankees against Tampa Bay Rays on August 12th.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye'," declared the 14-time All-Star Game participants of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was selected as the most valuable player of the League, he won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a ten-year contract provided him with 27 million dollars a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - in full custody.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back for a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his team ("Runs") for Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005, he has created some miles.
With Hall-of-fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players in the most important statistics show similar values.
However, the 41-year-olds should not be included in the Baseball's bedroom.
Because so successful Rodriguez - Spitzname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so confused his appearance is outside the place.
In 2009 the superstar at the "ESPN" had to take away forbidden steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was arrested for 211 parties due to a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have been a major suspect for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the spore was still reduced to 162 conflicts.
"The League could have even made a case for me for 2014 because I've been playing 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said.
Even his days of separation did not go unheeded.
While many Baseball legends in their last games still receive the big bets, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a divorce tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
At the same time, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and was followed by the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actor Kate Hudson, obtained sympathies of the fans of the Yankee Erzrivel Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang at 4:9 a.m. assembly against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekawa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Enlightened: Due to a positive doping test, weighttheber Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be exceeded by the first official doping cases.
A mixed athletics had almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the battle, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese skimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-Hindernislöuferin Silwia Danekawa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightmaster Adrian Zielinski were tested and closed in Brazil – immediately before the start of the critically-intentioned league competitions, these messages will come to an end.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, used as a masking tool for doping substances, has already been demonstrated during the last Sunday.
On Friday afternoon, the International Sport Court confirmed its conclusion of the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-olds had placed the fourth place in the final over 100 m Schmetterling, just 0.09 seconds passed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have to take part in the ride over 50 m freestyle.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-test and listen.
The national association takes the matter "very serious and demanding full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", Xinhua quoted a communication, "We will cooperate with the International Sport Court of Justice CAS and accept the judgment".
For the first time in history, IOC is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for sanctioning sportsmen with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive trial in Danekowa, who was 33 years of age, came into the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV transmitter BNT.
They are innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the lecturer explained.
The report should be followed by the banned substance for EPO.
Danekowa has been temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-probe should also be positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borisssow reported on his criticism of the Athletics.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under surveillance, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, almost all the weights of the chronic doping-loaded nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, and the London Olympicsman in the class was tested as his brother Thomassz three days ago positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
However, both of them are concerned, both must not start within the class up to 94 kg.
Before the launch of the Leichtäletäleten, Danekova is a further serious obstacle to the reputation of the whole sport.
The IAAF World Alliance had prevented the complete Russian crew from starting up to an exception because of systematic dopings, and Kenya's survival also produced many bad news in Rio.
Furthermore, in skiing, the earlier departures in China had also provided for severe austerity regulations between the athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt captured the Chinese Olympics' Sun Yang.
"Sun the King pinkelt lila."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to pass it," said Lacourt in French radio.
Sun was also in the middle of an austerity with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for doping bets," he said.
In 2014, the Chinese masters were tested positively on the Stimulans Trimetazidin, but only a dremonative spree had to be removed.
Data key: so powerfully express hacker your money
Programmeners of Depression malware are currently taking up targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a current inquiry by Malware Abbrehr Specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies interviewed in the last 12 months were at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with Erpresser software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies had already been the target of a ransomware printing.
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom money required by the perpetrators to re-use the affected systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize in their press software according to the comments of Malwarebytes on attacks on companies' networks.
If they are successful there, the potential to express money is significantly higher than in private users.
"We are currently observing a shocking rapid evolution of damage software," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in the conversation with the "World".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the editors discovered the embossing software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place quickly in the past months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently modified files such as words, Excel or database files, as well as files of images and videos.
These files unlock the ransomware and delete the originals permanently.
Next, the software presents the demands of the printers.
In order to get the encryption code to the files, the victims must deliver money - mostly in the form of the bitcoin encryption.
However, where private users have the personal photo database on the game, there are companies with sensitive customer data or project data banks without supporting production.
At the same time, the damage occurs when a ransomware is added.
22 per cent of the German companies concerned reported loss of consumption by ransomware, 13 per cent even had to completely break down the business, in a case where people were at risk of life.
In Germany, there have already been several cases of attacks that could be acutely threatened by the loss of diseases.
"We always say the victims: don't pay, you just promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay receive their data again.
For the manager it is difficult, given the position of the operator in the operation, to deny the request of the manufacturer.
The hackers know this again and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated user surfaces and contacts with the printers and come to the conclusion that the workers are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to earn more money.
They explain their offers via chat, how they can be paid via Bitcoin, turn free support websites into or resolve examples files.
And when private people are released after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to deal very hard and pay five sums in order to get their data back unencumbered.
In view of the potential high and relatively risky gains from ransomware printing, hackers are always professional and share the work, explained safety expert Chester Wisniewski by antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."
But it's more likely that it's about three or four people.
The programmers then sell their software in the form of a software builder to the real printers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a single fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The printers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you are in one of the forums in the background, buy the set of a criminal and hire another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made by an infected computer.
"Probably the criminals are responsible for spammers with distribution," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of the company's IT respondents in the malwarebytes survey trust to be able to reverse ransomware through file-back-ups and scanner software.
Similarly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.
"If the data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to success, the perpetrators will rather risk publishing sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," says Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, the damage potential of each type of data is much higher than before.
In the future, the workers could also take full new goals on the Internet of things on the brain.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the free movement of such blocked heating could be so sometimes a ransom.
If the manufacturer then blocks a whole manufacturing street in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a theme in the industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little cupé and also the flexibility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, is actually a very flexible one every day.
Although only 1,60 m high HR-V works a little more small, passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and the fund, it does not work at any point.
The materials in the interior are well processed and active, only the cockpit surface falls from there.
More diverse than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at the restaurant.
There is not only a coffee room of 453 l in raised and 1026 l in surrounded return beds, but there is the "Magic Seas".
That's less magical than it sounds: The seating areas of the back bank can be as high as Kinosel and offer from the restaurant, which is from the ground to the deck of 1.24 m high.
The coffee room can be well loaded, however the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than compared to the 2008 peugeot.
The tested 1,6-l-diesel with 88 kW/120 PS speeds the HR-V due to the momentum of up to 300 nm in large diameter areas.
However, he should do his job a little bit easier.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is satisfactory.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l-benzene with 96 kW/130 PS.
A Allradian drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the link should be something more direct.
The equipment cannot open in the tested "executive" top variant.
The safety systems include the City-Not-Bream Assistant (worked up to Tempo 32), the Collition Warning System and the Sporhold Assistant.
The collition alarm is sometimes irradiated because it assesses many obstacles as "removing objects".
The remote service is very reliable.
And the intelligent Temporal Ruler reacts to the recognition of traffic and, if necessary, disturbs the speed.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch screens, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are under the armrest and are therefore something to be achieved.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top part are fine.
Whoever does not want to invest so much, the Benzier will receive 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a wide and daily car.
Airline does not have: storm on the airport bridge
An airline does not have a passenger's noise on the airport bridge.
Because a liability is only thought of when it comes to risks typical of air transport, the Oberlandegericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The complainant had broken a knife at the storm.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, so the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damage.
Illness: When the organizer pays
Sick holidayers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is found in the hotel without doubt.
But that is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the case under discussion, a family was seriously injured on the second day of their Turkish holidays.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Her illness led the runner back to a defective clearing system, which apparently damaged the seawater.
The family was the view that the trip was not so easy - and complained against the organizer.
The complainants were not successful before the court.
However, the clearance system was in fact defective.
However, the organizer will soon learn about it before the complainants are removed from it.
Until then, he had to leave that the seawater was all right.
So he did not violate his information obligations, so the judgment.
No cleaning was found in the samples of the water.
The recovery of several hotel guests - possibly by inter-saving each other - is a general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were injured.
De Maizière said that after the violence experienced by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people had further concerns.
The state must be protected and decided to respond simultaneously to terrorist attacks.
It is certain: Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with Hass and column.
This triumph is not going to defeat the terrorists.
If criminals have to leave the country faster, however, it will increase security and strengthen the people's approval for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals until the 2017 German elections.
He also announced further personal strengthening of the security forces, "in the medium-sized order of size over several years".
A sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance should be improved so that the right of arms is renewed so that, in particular, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is forced.
The most frequently discussed Swedish obligation for doctors should remain in accordance with the words of the Maizières.
However, he wants to look for solutions in the medical dialogue to reduce the risk of the citizens, he said with a view to mental events.
In order to combat the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister has a better social care.
Teachers had to be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
For the prosecution of crimes in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of hidden detectors.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security."
It is important that the Interior Minister has clearly spoken against actionism.
"It was an honor for the screenmaker in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously withdrawn his appeal from the Union following a Burka ban and the withdrawal of the dual state membership.
A general ban on full-time education is considered to be a constitutional problem.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I'll take off the trail of the Burka.
You can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses before court.
Green Chief Simone Peter proposed to the Minister that he would like to simulate with every new anti-terror package the effectiveness and ability of action.
Mr. Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotty speeches and a violation of the right of residence will no longer give people security in this country."
Better traffic flow on the car provider
It is regularly on the surrounding road - here is a picture of November.
But that should change: the rule of law should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are on the bus every night on the surrounding street when they drive on the road (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16/17) the country's road business extends the law enforcement trail to 700 metres between Hammer Street and Weseler Street.
Car drivers can then hit directly from the Hammer Street right.
The main advantage: Transport is more early, thereby improving overall on the broad-based section of the Federal Street 51.
The idea with the extended departure had the CDU fraction in the region represented Münster-West.
The train association on the supplier is the car driver's nerves, especially between 17 and 19 hours.
Workdays reach the back up to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is that the naddle is on the B 51 just before the exit of Weseler Street.
From here the transport will only be carried through the road bridge in a single way.
The second track had to be restored well-induced years ago.
The reason: Statistical calculations have shown that the brakes no longer have the strength required to take up heavy transport twice.
The duration of this adjustment and the associated working position cannot be stated by the competent national authority.
However, it is to be calculated for years: because the bridge has an official residence period up to 2034.
For the extension of law enforcement, the country industry has been aware of the weaker time of transport in the schools because of obstacles.
The transport is conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theater section "The Invisible House".
The Nima Union and the young Theater are planning a music project now.
Nima's Union allows young people with the background of migration and refugee change to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Wood School Children's House has visited a presentation of the price-creded item "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the Union of Nima, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the instation in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the Union, which has aimed at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within this project.
Most young people in the class were from September 2015 to March 2016, including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreography, the Chinese pictures and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action yet, so the press release of the young Theater Münster.
The Nima's Union, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from language, and the young theater will be working together in the future in the framework of a music theater project.
From October to December, young people with and without a flight and migration background should be given the opportunity to visit professionally trained courses in the fields of music, dance, play and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatrical language communication are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association is counted with many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of thunderdrops: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the Starnsknucking Gockers in South West Germany a strike by the count on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was because of clouds and rain, it was bad enough to observe the sky scene, said the president of the Starnwaite Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather will be good, then we will see a lot of stars in the sky.
In the starships, it is about passages that belong to the fastest star holes with 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have your names because they appear to come from the star image of Perseus, which stands in the north.
Bad night: Tips against Sleep Disorders
In the evening you stay home forever, you stay awake for hours, tomorrow is no longer to think about sleep before the weekend.
That's all other than revenge.
At the same time, you have such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent receive their sleep more frequently or permanently than not profitable.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders arise?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there may be multiple causes, stressed Hans-Günter Wehet, member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand from the bottom is the loneliness, so it's a loss of sleep and sleep.
Many people feel uncomfortable or inadequate in their sleep, says Jens Carneicht, a member of the board of directors of the German household with practice in the Lower Saxony.
What happens behind sleep disturbances?
The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.
However, organic, mental or behavioural factors may also be involved, but medicines may also be involved.
Not rare is sleep disorder expression of another disease.
"Very early waiting is particularly common in depression," says Weht.
And it can be that different factors are interfering.
For example, one who has a gang accident can be ill, waits for both two to three hours and begins to worry about everyday problems and concerns, there is a white example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
Since when should you have sleep disorders for your doctor?
Whoever does not sleep well for a period of at least three nights a week and is affected by day should go to the doctor, straight away.
The reaction can look quite different: feeling tired, tired, sleepless, having difficulties with attention and concentration, is easy to react, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
In order to reduce sleep loss, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include changes in behaviour, cognitive therapy or even medications - classic sleeping tablets only in the exception and at least for two weeks - questions.
There is hardly any sleep doctor in Germany, according to Prof. Ingo Fietze, leader of the interdisciplinary sleep health centre of Charité Universitätsmedijzin Berlin.
That is why you should first go to the househouse when you're sleeping.
It can explain with tests whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should be in the bedroom, and what's going on?
For research in sleep labs, physicians, for example in breast cancer, in severe day-to-day mortality, in sleep disorders, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explain it.
In fact, there is no need to prepare for the investigation.
You're supposed to spend the day normal.
"Please don't have to sleep in the afternoon," says Fietze.
After the cable, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nosebrush, a chest belt and a finger.
In addition, a camera on the deck draws the sleepers.
How can those involved get into the crisis?
There are quite a number of jobs that you can use for a better sleep.
Weight count: Regular bedtimes and wake-up periods, do not lie in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch to sleep, drink and not watch the hour - then start counting immediately, and that's not even encouraging.
What to do with missing media in the swimming pool
The former German skimer Markus Deibler appeared on Facebook to break down the DSV team at Olympics.
In December 2014, he first held gold at the World Cup in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler appeared on Facebook protecting his former former team colleagues in the critical situation.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € premiums and a diamond king should not be surprised by missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The promotion system in swimming sports is bad, the doping controls are very good.
In this way we cannot compete with countries that are very encouraging and do not look exactly at Doping or even act on it.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be put here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler had already been notified nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly what it should be with countries.
"If a certain time before WM/OS cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers, they must not participate," the electoral Hamburger, who is operating a part of the ice.
Airport: Bands of packs of tyres
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
Two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 were arrested on Thursday.
The suspects had carried out several bags and bags as a band.
At 21.30 hours, civil officials in the Düsseldorf airport again recognized a band known to the police from past Düsseldorfs.
The two women and two men had taken several duties this year since mid-July and were engaged in community, work and particularly professional work.
The Specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove four actions to the teeth that were themselves committed to bringing punishment to Germany.
They totalled more than EUR 15,000.
Old buildings, a few Lindenblums, among other things, include another headstone bottle: The Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not have the first look, but the police count it to the city's "dangerous places".
If you go along the way from east to west, you go to play places, a frozen child garden, and a Biolade.
At the fascade of a green house someone has been saying "häsalish!"
In contrast to a member who is also to be removed soon, it is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.
The article on this "terrestrial city area", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain is called, is, however, mainly trained with burning cars in the last few weeks.
The reason is the house with number 94: First it was occupied, while the residents of the rental agreements, however, are still occupied with rooms and are used for events.
In particular, the Berlin Internal Senator Henkel had been speaking several times since the beginning of the year for a serious police action against the project, which was called "No-Go Zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On June 22, after the rooms in the ground floor, which were surrounded by 300 police officers, patrolled the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three men's cars on the ground, closed parts of the street and stopped visitors from attending the house with number 94.
The rooms were constantly renovated by construction workers in order of the unknown household owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the room was illegal, and one day the police and construction workers came out under the yoke of sympathetic citizens and residents.
On this summer evening, the street is peaceful: parents go with children, people sit on the town street before the houses in the sun, others hold up in the form of late.
In the immediate vicinity of the home projects, there is a basic school and childcare.
Linke violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiev since 1999, and Jana*, who has raised three children here, are mainly motivated by police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concerns of increasing rents and Genitration.
It doesn't sound like a kiez, which most of the police were willing to take over in front of vandalizing links.
The graves, which the Berlin interior senator and the police create between housekeepers and their neighbors, are not so obvious.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was indeed a traditional working district, which today also has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Also, housing regulations and the housing projects from which they were born have been included for a long time: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street all near the Rigaer.
While the mains of the large police station were located in a regular street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still in part now inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years the city has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them people from DDR times and former owners share their Kiez.
This is also seen in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.
Many of the noveltys in the Rigaer are treated as symbols for this development: they are recognized by the united ships or freshly lined fascists who have been attacked by colored beads.
No other road has been mentioned this year so often with the words "linkaautonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body damage are closely related to statistics against police.
Most of the victims are victims of damages that tend to hit new and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a village in addition to the divided 94 for 17 years, there can be no word of uncertainty.
As for violence, it is disturbing: the people in the 94s are their neighbors, who were not certain of it.
Even the famous burning cars no longer give it directly in the Rigaer.
For the studied architects, their road is not a criminal point of fire, in contrast: "He helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more apart with each other than he does."
Renewables have been brought into the Rigaer street - and remained.
That is why it was also so important for the inhabitants to get back to their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the dignitary over the city area in July.
However, in the eyes of the inhabitants of the likes of the builders, the streets will continue to be taken away: by invisible neo-nuts in ancient buildings that excavate the old inhabitants.
"These are, in the end, property dwellings that are not interesting for many here - more people who are not so well affected," she says.
"I can't be good enough for evil and destruction."
But what should you do if someone doesn't listen?
There's a frustration on all sides, also with the police and the residents.
For visitors, who are excited about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left stage were part of the church.
Whoever turns around should be aware of it - just like someone who's drawn into a knife hole, there's a bad feeling about anger.
All the persons represented by the names have therefore prayed not to be named by their proper name.
Urban: Annika Dischle is a new refugee mission
Annika Deschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organisation.
She is also a social worker.
Since July, Annika Deschle has been the refugee officer of Urbach.
The social agenda supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
It is seen as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, labour force refugees, administration, authorities and others who are still involved.
Reine customers from the labour market show that honorary people are more grateful than that Godschle is now here, the precious sweetness that has a problem in particular.
Some of these - less exciting than much more to the number of areas of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the position.
It has been sought for a Administrative Power with a talent for languages and people, linked to a long-term experience in social work, as well as an exciting wave of welfare.
However, administrative work is not her central area, I mean Annika Deschle.
Above all, it is about organization, work with people in the community and also behind the cults and network activity.
The 31st year is about six weeks ago.
She's been breastfeeding a 50 percent steel for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Reine Customers, that Annika Deschle supports honorary and dominant actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
There are new containers in the water street.
A serious problem has been for some time to find housing for the asylum refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the delivery of access.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms.
The cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility varies from the Landrassamt to the Commune and Job Centre.
Problem: There are free property, but not every renter wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been rather difficult for some time.
The fact is that the administration does not find private dwellings.
It doesn't work until it's shown to private homes, so divine.
Therefore, common housing needs to be improved, as it is called beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in the washing street.
But it's not done with apartments.
Perspective is the word, Regine customers and Annika Deschle agree.
In addition to a stable life, there are practical places, training places, schools, a Euro Jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"There'd be more places," says Reine Customer.
Many work in the building or help house teachers, resulting in joint work - and it is motivated and very well, as Annika Deschle reports.
It hopes that work for the Community will lead to a positive external effect.
It's "no employment therapy".
But work means more than just work.
The day needs a solid structure, say the gods and customers.
People had to develop a sense of belonging.
So there is a need for offers such as sports, contacts with natives and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So there are also administrative and honorary flows in here.
It is central for refugees to feel welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedure is a problem.
They need to explain to refugees that it is time to spend more and more time, for example, with language courses.
Whoever ever develops the feeling, he cannot help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, who will never integrate.
The great majority had been motivated.
However, there are also problems, says customers honestly, "People who don't have anything to do with it." Therefore, the work of gods and customers is always to motivate others.
It's all a mother-to-child assignment.
A difficult question: Did the two of them have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Reine customers quite clearly, "something some naiv named may." A restriction could and would not exclude them.
But the help has already been felt.
These events were also the subject of refugees.
They were afraid that the attacker would bring them to nothing.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Reine Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Therefore, the main and honourable members must remain on the ground and in the region after the Committee's work.
They are always in the background that a new wave of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is involved.
In fact, it's unusual to put them in place.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach yet where we met," says Annika Deschle.
No new refugees, that would slow down the situation.
Reine customers also make it clear that the urbaners are already equipped to integrate the people before.
There are currently about 100 people, too young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women are comfortable.
The political world is so complicated that there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Infrared infragger
The police bomber flew about an hour and a half from different areas.
Two unknown men were raped on Friday morning against 8.50 a.m. in an apartment in a multiple family home on Lindenway.
The man surprised the two of them and killed the hostages in the flight.
The two men were about 1,65 to 1,70 meters large, perhaps masked, wearing both blue and black cappuccino.
They flew to the city of Innenstadt.
The police were arrested and arrested by several police officers as well as a police officer.
The arrest was unsuccessful.
If so, the unknowns are approaching the apartment relatively during their flight.
Baden-Württemberg: Police reported after Rocker attack on Imbis

Then they should attack two guests and have suffered a slight loss.
Then they fly.

The investigators follow a fight in the Ulmer Rockermilieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
