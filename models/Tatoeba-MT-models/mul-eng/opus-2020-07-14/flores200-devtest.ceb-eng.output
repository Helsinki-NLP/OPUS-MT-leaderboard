In this new environment there are different efforts and different competencies, therefore, new populations and other characteristics or adaptations will need to be strong competition only what they need first.
No change in the original population, they still need the same adjustments as they used to be.

All in the community are dwindling and using transport systems, and almost everyone is complaining about transport systems.
In developing countries, it is rare to hear and have similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or the fall of toilets.

The Traffic Strip is the study of each driver’s action and insurance between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to learn how to drive a truck because a hundred percent of the driver’s habits cannot be safe.
Fortunately, drivers run at reasonable speeds; thus, traffic jams have considerable continuity and may be represented in mathematics.
In order to better present the traffic stage, there is a relationship that is shown among the first three characteristics: (1) descent, (2) density, and (3) descent.
These relationships can help to plan, design, and operations of road facilities.
