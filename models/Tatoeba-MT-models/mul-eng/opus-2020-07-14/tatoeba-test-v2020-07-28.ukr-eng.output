You know what they're actresses.
I don't think you're heartless.
It was built forever.
He gave a test.
Who are you?
Tom was too tired to take care of himself.
Tom left Mary a sword.
Tom's pretty convincing, isn't he?
I'm sorry to talk to them.
He tried not to cry.
They feel it.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Who told you what I did?
It's never late.
Leave me alone, I'll sleep.
Aren't you ready for more?
Tom has no idea why Mary made a mistake.
Tom's looking for work.
My father will be back in a few days.

Well, that explains everything.
You're a general optimist, aren't you?

You've got the scars on you.
This book was sold well in Japan.
I like dancing.
That's what everyone learned.
Tom on your heart, right?
I'd like to become a famous football player.
Am I jealous?
Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing this.
Since I didn't get an answer, I wrote it again.
What would you like to say?
You think it's a trap?
People, stop killing one another.
I'm wondering if Tom and Mary planned to do this.
I borrowed a car in Tom's car.
I don't think I could spend six hours alone with you.
The furniture's almost gone.
I'm ready to go, and Tom isn't.
I feel like someone else.
Whatever happens, I'll stay with you.

You can be right.
That looks better.
He's having dinner.
You gave me a word.
I want Tom to wait.
We're here!
Does that hurt you?
What's in the box?
She'll burn.
Tom treated Mary like a child.
Why are you so sad?
I did it just for fun.
Tom refused to say anything.

You're too old.
We've been talking for years.
I'm very drunk.

Did you see how he went out?
Can I talk to Mrs. Brown?
He moved to the center of London.
What was in it?
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
What do you like about summer or winter?
Aren't you planning on doing this?
Happily, no one has been injured.
No one knows who killed Tom.
It's not as hard as you think.
Why are you mad at me?
Let's go have a drink.
You have to wait.

I hope you like it.

She's five.
Your word and God would be in your ear!
Tom's coming next week.
You need to stop doing this right now.
My grandfather is very calm.
You won?
She can speak English quite well.
I need to go.
Tom didn't seem too worried.
Tom says he's planning to do this.
What he did was not wrong.
Can you give me a minute?
Is there anything cold to drink?
I need to talk to them.
They're too big.
We give you another chance.
I could do that.
Well, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
He's a student-medic.
It's not necessarily that way.

He was talking about himself.
Let's put the inside in until the light.
Tom looked in the window and saw Mary's car.
We'll get another chance.
In Tom, they confiscated the car and sold a new owner.

There's one problem.
I don't remember exactly what Tom said.
Why did you come back here?
The room's burning.
Tom's capable of playing guitar, I think.
We saw it.
Tom never breaks a promise.
The girl's untrustworthy.
I think I'm playing tennis with Tom.
I was too proud.
I forgot to do what Tom asked me to do.
I really want to go to Boston.
Let's start again.
I really loved her.

I want to drink a cup of tea.
What's your father doing?
I'm a luser.
You know my wife?
Tom began to study French.
Tom's down on a fruity morosy.

Tom and I had an accident at work.
Aren't you upset?
We've got half an egg.
Tom refused to go.
She drank coffee.
Tom repeated what Mary said.
So it was thirty when he died.
I want you to succeed.
He read a lot earlier.
What do you think happened?
Mom's covered up on the table.
Please bring me a cleaner than that.
Mary's patient, isn't she?
Do you think Tom is part of the problem?
Tom didn't want to go on a walk.
Tom's waiting for me on the corner.
I'll put my coffee on top.
I can't take this camera anymore.
Please don't go.
I was impressed by Tom’s honesty.
I read the letters you sent me.
Have you ever seen a DTP?

Wait, I'll pay for it.
We're sure of his success.

Have you ever denied the Statue of Freedom?
I have an idea.
I just bought a little card.
I'm for Tom's old age.
This evening's cold.
Why did you come home today?

Don't you want me to do something?
Tom can't change that.
Would you like Tom to do this to you?
You knew Tom was alone?
Mary is my oldest sister.
He finally succeeded.

Ready number.
I want it now.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
I don't like spending money on anyone.
We're teachers.
We're in the evacuation zone.

You have to stop doing this.
That's a good question.

You think I'm crazy?
This bus is going to Minsk.
I need to find them now.
My mother likes to eat a local cheese.
Nothing new.
I love her.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
I'm totally comfortable.
You wanted to say that?
You want bananas?
We need to be at work until nine.
We're all asleep.
I'm not gonna wash my hands.
What?
Tom went to see Mary.
I have money.
I thought Tom understood.
Do you have a big family?
I'm a tax collector.
Tom holds his hand in his right hand.
There's a lot of coffee.
I'm glad you're okay.
Tom recognized me.
You're kidding.
Tom followed Mary on the street.
It's Tom who kissed Mary, not John.
I have other plans for you.
You see Tom?
I like to ride my bike.
The bullet found its purpose.
Tom ran to meet Mary.
What can I help?

I doubt Tom will ever decide to consider the possibility of going to Australia.
Depends on the context.
This is my dog.
Tom's working all day.
Does that mean it?
Tom’s eyes were still not used to the darkness, so he didn’t see anything.
You can't smoke in this room.
He'll come tomorrow morning.
I hate that photograph.
I understood him.
Aren't you getting tired?
I'm sorry.
The procedure for removing the latrine is very painful.
The Russian language is considered a complex language.
Thank you for telling me the truth.
He pulled out the chocolate.
Tom got me.
Are you sure Tom's gonna do this?
After she finished working, she went home.
Who wants to go with me?
Tom said it wouldn't be hard to do it.
It turns out that many Turkish trolls are on Tatoebe.
Why are you lying?
Is that just a coincidence?
Tom may not know where Mary is.
Nothing's working.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
How could you let him do this to you?
What did you say to him?
She's almost there.
Don't drink too much coffee.
Can You Answer?
What happened on October 20th?
I guess Tom doesn't have anything to do with this.
If you have any questions, let me know.
I'll meet Tom.
I want to kiss you.
He was very busy all day.
I'm sure you'll be back.
He was able to escape.
I wonder what Tom's thinking.
Tom will bring Mary.
None of us speak French.
She saw how he drank the honey.
You have to tell him what you can't do.
Tom's been a little late.
Tom's good to speak French.
Tom said he couldn't find anything to eat.
Today's a nice day.
Fashion changes quickly.
I'm absolutely confused.
I couldn't figure out who it was.
Last year was a bad harvest.
Tom made you.
I was busy.
Tell me, please, where's the egg?
Tom is a friendly boy.
He's eating now.
Eucharistic cells have a nuclear system.
It's starting.
I still have the key from Tom's house.
She had long been talking about her inherited experience.
They're all hungry.
You don't have to worry about it.

Be reasonable.
I'm afraid so.
You really need to help him do this.

I was working.
I wasn't allowed to see her.
Did Tom sleep well?
Tom and Mary told John.
The elevator didn't work.
You're fine.
There's no one here except me.
Tom didn't want to do this to you.
I saw you on TV.
Mother Fadla married her husband.
He's got ten cows.
I like English.
You're cruel.
It looks like an eagle's already here.
I saw a man come into the room.
He's just not a fool.
I was afraid that might happen.
Who else was at the meeting?
He's talking too fast.
Tom suggested that Mary have a good job.
Will Tom help you?
She has a good face.
Tom didn't want that.
This man cannot distinguish justice from sin.
You're a panda.
I'm not sure where my hotel is.
What sugars do you like?
I almost forgot that it was his birthday.
What's keeping you so late?
Leila accused Fadla of being meeting with other women.
Go with Tom.
I thought he was coming alone.
Tom Jackson is my boss.

I'm kidding.
I think I asked a good question.
Okay, I have to make a proposal.
Lithuania joins the European Union.
He was right.
I taught my wife to drive.
I stopped doing this.
Who's your favorite figure?

Tom asks us to help him.
I'm from Denmark.

Get your things.
Am I right?
I'm not going to church anymore.
My name is Henry.
Tom knows he's got to keep working.
Tom doesn't drive the car to Boston.
I'm still afraid to do this.
I don't want to do this alone.
Tom didn't know he had a secret guest.
Tom is following Mary.
I still don't like Tom.
So we better stay home.
Tom, it looks like he's hungry.
Did you know Tom?
Tom said he had a lot of friends in Boston.
Ija's coming.
Tom and Mary are all right.
I can see myself in the mirror.
It would be nice to see Tom again.
Ten minutes to the station on the bus.
Why is Tom not planning to do this?
There's plenty to eat.
Tom is taller than me.
That's exactly what I didn't think about.
I was waiting.
In Washington, it's the flowers of the east.
You know a good restaurant?
Tom was the oldest in our class.
He is three years older than she is.
What if our plan doesn't work?
Here's the water.
You're always careful.
Tom didn't expect anyone.
I need to hurry to the station to get on the last trip.
I don't understand, but I don't usually understand.
I've been listening to jazz all morning.
Tom used to date Mary and John.
A girl dressed in white, my name.
Tom's gone.
The doors are open for the second thirty days.
I want you to talk to Tom about his behavior.
I'm not in love with Lele.
He had only fourteen.
I'm teaching you to play chess.
Month's already gone.
If it wasn't there, I just can't accept it.
Did you find any problems?
Who's going?
It's coming out tomorrow.
Tom is shy enough, right?
I found out that Tom and I had an accident.
I hope you'll be back.
Is there anything you would like to buy?
You told me to do this.
Tom and Mary are opponents.
Tom wants me to apologize.
Try not to cry.
You've got a very close ear.
Can you do this again?
Are your children still asleep?
You have to try again.
Is Tom a Christian?
I want to see what's going on.
Tom sat in front of Mary.
I have less money than you have.
Tom lives in Boston, huh?
He's an official worker.
You think Tom's gonna win, right?
You couldn't stop, please?
They went after you.
I'm waiting for your answer.
Tom was without a scarp.
The room's closed.
Of course, sweethearts.
Please, do it fast.
He agreed with me.
Could you show me the way to the port?
What did you do last night?
Tom is a good doctor.
Don't you want this job?
Tom said he needed to buy something to drink.
Tom thinks Mary is innocent.
I waited under the rain for at least ten minutes.
I'm wondering if Tom already told Mary that she needs to do this.
Are you using modern technology?
You've been working.
Tom's in his room.
Did you see anyone except Tom last night?
Is that a reliable list?
Don't get to the park.
Will this be reexamined today?
I don't know what Tom promised.
Are you ready to go?
Please take your shoes off.
We need some money.
I knew it all.
Do I need to do this right now?
Kate's trying to get in touch.
No one on the Internet knows you're a cat.
The girl is so close that I can't distinguish them.
Tony broke it.
What's up?
It was easy to answer.
Thank you for the information.
I have the right to know the truth.
I can't confirm that.
Where can I get my bag?
Tom said he was hoping Mary could win.
Wake up, kids.
I've had a lot of drinks.
Who else did you tell?
Tom lost his voice.
Is that your beer?
Security is not guaranteed.
I didn't see them.
Tom, we're going to dance.
Give me your coat.
You have nothing.
Even a teacher may make mistakes.
We were disappointed in him.
Tom, maybe it's dead already.
I'm gay.
Why am I so tired?
Wait till the end of my exams.
How many children do you have?
I haven't finished with Tom yet.
There are thousands of refugees in Ukraine.
You're very busy, aren't you?
I didn't testify.
We need kids fast.
Does anyone know the name of the deceased?
Here's the news.
Did you read this book?
You're not tall enough.
I just came from school.
I have nothing to do with this.
Do you like Japanese food?
I'm sorry Tom thinks so.
You look surprised.
Wow, it looks cute.
Have you ever been shot in the elevator?
The operation cannot be expected.
What time did this take?
Do not try to do this on your own.
The survivors were not.
They've lost a DNA sample.
If I had time, I'd visit Tom.
Put it on the police.
Tom can't come.
I don't know where Tom is.
Your prophecy has come true.
Macros for jEdit are written on BeanShell.
You want to come with us to the concert?
Is that a fire machine?
Every food and drink is delicious and beneficial, but you need to know time, place, and measure.
I think it's a good argument.
I wonder if she'll recognize me after so many years.
Sometimes I'm very insecure.
I know you don't trust us.
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia next week.
Tom had to wait.
You ate.
I haven't seen him for nearly three years.
I'm afraid I'm not gonna finish the story in time.
I guess I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
She's traveling the world.
Boys are all right.
It's interesting if Tom told Mary that she had to do this.
Tom said why he needed the money?
You're good.
What does he look like?
I don't live in Boston anymore, I moved to Chicago.
It just happened once.
There's Mount Fudy out there.
The same human mind is wise.
It's already started.
Does your father know about this?
Tom's photogenic.
Please don't stay with me for a while.
The man tried to set up his own antenna.
They don't even know why.
Brehon!
Well, maybe you're right.
The Institute is a waste of time.
Tom thought about the sister’s happiness.
You know where Tom is?
They're very nice.
Give me something to write.
I really like Tom.
We don't have any lessons tomorrow.
I want to study the paper.
There's an orange on the table.
Never leave me alone with Tom.
Mary does what she says to do.
It's a very good movie.
Why doesn't anyone answer?
Tom told me that, in his opinion, he had a flu.
My blood was covered.
You gave me good advice.
This bike doesn't belong to Him.
I thought you lost my watch.
I don't remember you at all.
These houses are my uncle.
I just did my job.
Tom didn't call anyone.
No one knows what will happen.
We're always waiting for something.
Thank you very much.
I'm not sorry.
Many young people this summer went to Hawaii.
Tom is my brother-in-law.
There are no comments at this time.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
Do not give up.
You pay for it!
You understand me?
Tom's gone.
Tom thinks Mary can do this?
Is that your hat?
Remember, you're poor.
You want me to go with you?
She's white?
Love triangles — patience and knees.
You like coconut water?
Barcelona is located in Spain.
He's very weird.
There's only one piece left.
I wanted to see this movie with you.
I've learned to paint in five years.
He is afraid that Mary’s feelings may be clouded.
Tom was trying to save Mary.
I came in time.
Where's your bag?
She got rid of the company.
She's trying this again.
They found the trails on the snow.
My friends believe that postpartumism is a joke.
Do as I say, not as I do.
Tom's always got the best photos in the profile.
I sat in the taxi.
The sport is always easy for him.
Come on, I'm not surprised.
That's what you're hurting.
Tom came here about two and a half years ago.
Kischa protected her hair.
It's not his heart.
You can say whatever you want.
It's enough for one day.
Tom gave Mary her heart.
I don't think Tom will remember me.
He speaks German.
Tom's not as busy as you are.
Why are you so upset?
You're a very horrendous man.
I'm totally hungry.
No one's heard anything about my country.
He became a national hero.
Tom said where did he do it?
We're studying Chinese.
How do I get on the other side?
Do we have a choice?
It's okay.
Let me see.
Tom began to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He's running to the station every morning.
They're closing the commission.
Not here.
No one was satisfied.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I tried to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
That's why it's in this building.
We'll open tomorrow.
I didn't expect this to happen.
I think I'm gonna start with a beer bottle.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There must be some logic.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us color the bread?
Were you in Washington, D.C.?
Mary kept the balance.
I just got lucky.
They're very subjective.
It's a trap.
I'm wondering if Tom's hearty or not.
I need to get ready for the test.
Flights to the east.
Don't let him touch it.
Tom says he's your friend.
In the Soviet Union, television is viewed by viewers!
He called me.
He invited her to the concert.
How does the suspect look?
No one could stop it.
Tom died of hunger.
Good that you're here.
I put the cat in.
I left your passport in the bus.
A car in a child's room.
This animal eats people?
Are you a vegetarian?
You want to live forever?
Listen to what I have to say.
He'll be here soon.
Can't you pick me up?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't break up.
I have questions.
It won't be enough!
Tom said that Mary might still be involved.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The chief allowed me to leave earlier today.
What time is the end of the world?
I'll never worry.
How nice!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I owe him nothing.
Where's your key?
Tonight's gonna be cold enough.
I won't ask Tom for help.
How much you paid to do that.
You don't have to leave.
One day we'll meet again.
You said you wouldn't do that.
It was a long flight.
Don't tell anyone.
It's time for me to go.
I was upset.
Tom beat me up.
How many people have died?
Did these guys do anything to you?
Is Mike a member of the crew on board?
Tom's doing orders.
You don't listen.
They found nothing.
Don't worry.
I'm Antonio.
This land belongs to the royal family.
Are these feelings real?
We really want that, don't we?
Finally, he took note of her proposal.
Tom was not surprised at Mary’s excellent speech in French.
I know you're here.
I'm on the third floor now.
Are you not happy that you are rich?
There is no hope.
It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost there.
So you have to be home at 2:30.
You're going to school with a pizza?
Is this Tom's girl?
Tom's just wasting his time.
The molecule consists of atoms.
We understand that.
It's not a very long time now.
Do you have time to talk to me?
I'm sorry he didn't come to the meeting.
Where are you now?
Be careful with Bob, you know, he's been through a difficult period recently.
Tom married a neighbor.
I have a headache.
Again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.
I'm learning English.
It's a tough time, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate it!
You're a little late for me.
Tom, take care of yourself.
Tom said that Mary is expected to do this.
Tom didn't think so.
My parents just came to the corner.
I took my hand off.
This year did you buy a free gift for Tom?
He's something to do with this burial.
My kit looks sad.
Tom and Mary only eat the fruit that grows on their own.
Tom showed his driving rights to the police.
Show me that you're in the shower.
She picked up the pieces of a broken trial.
When does it start?
Tom felt good.
What have you learned today?
I'm working on my own.
Tom's command took 96 eyes, 55 eyes were loaded in the first team, how many eyes were taken in the second team?
What about me?
We're on our way home.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
I'll be back in less than five minutes.
You're going to get too high.
I'd like to order a boat.
Tom gave me a present.
Where's Dad?
Who else helped you?
I'd be happy to help you.
You're 18?
The dog is trying to escape.
Tom can't read.
I just bought a boat.
Tom had no idea that Mary had fallen on him.
That's disgusting.
Aptek is on the streets of Fresno.
Tom, your uncle, isn't he?
Are you ready to hear bad news?
I talked to them.
Lucy's already on the phone?
Looks like Tom.
You don't have to do this if you don't want to.
I was just about to make a mistake.
That's cute!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where's Tom got to do this?
Mary wants me to be in her command.
No one's listening anymore.
You're brave.
You should do this yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit there.
Put him on.
Tom came to the last.
The prisoners will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate alone.
Are you sure you'll find them?
I'm a bad man.
Are you sure Tom's coming?
Where'd you get this key?
Can I help you, ma'am?
I don't think I'm gonna be sad.
Tom's gonna go instead of you.
You think the fish can hear?
Tom was released yesterday.
She's reading.
The poor Tom is trying to sleep for three hours.
Tom moved to Australia.
We need to remember that.
I changed the Wi-Fi password.
It's not my problem.
I thought you lost my watch.
They're brothers.
Mary said she'd do it.
I'm older than him.
Tom's in the gym.
Tom's in desperate.
Toma's dog followed him to school.
Who taught Tom how to do this?
Tom doesn't do that very often.
Can I use your phone?
Tom has too many jobs.
She's eating now.
You're married to two couples, you're not getting anyone.
He never meant for Leah himself.
There must be a system.
I'll give you all the money you need.
Tom is a socialist.
So I needed to talk.
How do you live?
I think I'll be busy this week.
I left Africa forever.
Tom, a Christian.
You shouldn't lie.
We don't have sugar.
I had a wonderful dream tonight.
I was at the meeting last night.
I'm done.
If you're trying to go on your own, please.
Unity is better than unity.
China!
Tom said, in his opinion, Mary does not sleep.
Tom said he wouldn't sleep all night.
I just remember the noises.
Open the valve.
English is spoken in many parts of the world.
Do you like to do this?
Tom went into the kitchen.
Where'd you get into the museum?
Do you want to eat the bed?
I'm sure Tom's wearing a ring.
I don't have any children.
Let Tom do this on his own.
She's in the refrigerator.
We're ready to help.
His brother was a very experienced worker.
I don't have a computer.
Tom's using you.
Where's my clothes?
Maybe you should help him.
Get down.
No one knows his real name.
I'd really like to sing with your girlfriend.
We avoid talking about politics.
I won't answer that.
I decided to let you go.
Everyone laughs.
Tom still can't drive the car.
Tom asked you to visit?
I'll be very sad about you if you leave Japan.
Did you ask Tom?
This woman says so, as if she's a teacher.
Did Tom let you do what you wanted?
Tom smells salt.
Now I'm unarmed.
I feel like an ambi.
This book has many pictures.
I think we lost her.
Was that always the same?
Tom already knows what Mary is planning to do.
He's an army officer.
What did you do then?
Tom said that I would act irresponsiblely.
I drank too much.
Tom bought Mary a place.
We're teachers.
Dad quickly put the paper down.
How the hell did Tom get here?
Tom's already grown up, right?
I really like you, don't you?
I don't have any money.
I don't believe in ghosts.
Go make the order over there.
I can do it on my own.
After the fall of a plane from Beijing, he was in his late 20 ’ s.
Sometimes I watch television.
Is this your house?
They were really satisfied.
Tom broke his throat.
Thank you for coming.
We should trust them.
Do you understand the phonetic object?
They said they weren't guilty.
He knew me.
Tuman's breaking up.
I'm sorry I'm worried about you, but could you help me?
Tom quickly opened the door.
Today's Wednesday, October 18th.
We'll do it.
Tom did it for you?
She knows her.
Tom said he'd be here.
Tom didn't agree with you.
Hello.
We don't need time anymore.
Are you studying French at school?
They're one year old.
My watch is five minutes away.
That's why I liked this idea.
I heard him die.
Show me what to do.
Tom introduced me to my wife.
I didn't think we did that.
It's not hard to find Tom.
I got some money.
They argued about who should sit ahead.
Tom and I were trying to cry.
What languages are you talking about?
I don't want to get involved with you.
He took the first place in the chess tournament.
His story is true?
The day Tom was born in October, and I was in November.
You have the right to be happy.
I'll meet him next Friday.
Don't worry, you can count on me.
Tom's car was parked there.
Give them a second chance.
Tom knows we don't want him to win?
Come on, don't talk.
The object-oriented programming is, first of all, the wrong address.
You're calling me today.
Why do you want to go back to Boston?
It's a pocket dictionary.
Tom's just working on it right now.
We want to talk to Tom.
Have you been drinking?
What do you know about Boston?
Tom, maybe he was a witness.
The station's not far away.
I'm not gonna wear this dress.
You should be yourself.
Get away from me.
I played tennis.
Ten years for you?
This soup is salty.
Did something strange happen?
I'm wondering if Tom's scared or not.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
Did you see my hand?
I usually go to the supermarket on Mondays.
I hate surprises.
I promised him not to do this.
They don't have horses.
You can sit down if you want.
I have information for her.
Tom may forget to do this.
He's hot.
She was white.
Tom doesn't swim very well.
I saw these pictures.
Did you lose your flower?
Tom was one of the last to go.
Mary went to the funeral.
I can't count on Tom.
I haven't had any breakfast yet.
All I have is books.
You don't know if Tom speaks French?
I'm not sick anymore.
Tom's not very good.
Aren't you free tomorrow morning?
In your dog's mouth, give him vitamins.
The machine generates a lot of electricity.
Food is always needed for life.
Then the bus left the city and went on the road.
You didn't see my birds?
Let's get out of here.
I'll finish college when you get back from America.
I don't understand math very well.
He cut my hand.
Tom's a lot older now.
I don't know what's going on.
Too bad.
I had a wonderful dream tonight.
What can you tell me about this?
Did you really see the NLO?
You're cheating on me with Tom.
I had a different teacher!
What do you like about Tommy?
All I have is one book.
I hid it under my bed.
I thought you'd be happy.
That's very sweet.
You shouldn't have signed a confession.
How do you feel today?
Here's our interpreter.
Oh, my God, I'm an atheist.
It's my daughter.
I gave him a little boy.
Did you think about it?
Math is the object I love less than anything.
Take Tom home.
I hid him somewhere.
Aren't you coming to my party?
I was in the car.
She said so, like she was my mom.
I'm a very shy person.
Tom is not aggressive at all.
Why did you do that?
Tell him I'm in the office.
Spanish is your native language.
Why don't Tom sing?
Don't you like my yellow hat?
To make her nose a little shorter, she would be pretty sympathetic.
You can't do this on your own, can you?
Tom lives here a little longer.
He did this through zeal.
Tom wanted to help.
Tom married a woman named Mary.
You were at work?
I just don't want to talk to you.
When did you get married?
I'm warning Tom.
Tom finally agreed to do this.
Do you think Tom's unchallenged?
Are you leaving a message?
We're getting closer to each other.
We wanted Tom.
He's older than me.
The thinker shot a bird.
Why do you need my help?
I'm going to pick up the speed.
Tom gave me three apples.
Why are you alone?
I'm sure Tom wouldn't agree.
I'm translating an article.
I think we should do this.
Her answer was not satisfying.
I'm working hard.
Can't you speak French?
I'd go to bed without Tom's help.
I'm thirty.
We're in Italy.
Put the candle on.
I want to drink some good food.
My dad's home.
I knew you'd suspect me.
I told you everything.
Don't get any closer.
Did you really see NLO?
Better wait for the next bus.
Have you been wearing sunscreen cream?
Tom said he was hoping you'd be at dinner.
This guy's a bad guy.
Let me do this.
Nothing special.
Didn't anybody help you?
No one saw him.
I always respected Tom.
Tom can't read.
All should help one another.
Tom is not your enemy.
Tom doesn't like pizza.
Mark's selling the car.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat.
He's in the school football team.
He's talking about himself.
Now is not the time to complain.
I'm working in Boston.
Do you prefer the media or the destruction?
This has helped us a lot.
How did you feel?
I'm wondering if Tom's really in trouble.
Did you hear the news?
Can you see the guilt card?
You must be very calm.
Tom didn't want to change his plans.
Mary wore a hat.
You prayed.
I know I'm imperfect.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
I'm still going to risk sharing the idea.
This guy eats bread.
I won't eat it.
Why give birth to children if it is possible to give birth?
I'd like to see you here.
I'll be present.
She can wait till the morning.
I was a winner.
I'm coloring the garage.
Not cold.
I've already called.
Who's your father?
I want Tom to know I don't hate him.
I realize how much you're probably upset.
I've got a dog's hair.
I'll show you something.
Tom's pregnant.
Tom did this meaningfully.
I turned my back on the spaghetti.
What do you like about this?
Hey, what's that?
We'll do everything in our power.
Everyone's going.
I've already read this book.
I was in Rome.
How much do you need now?
Let's not be enemies.
Misha's gone to the table.
Tom says he doesn't want to go.
I was busy yesterday.
Tom threw it into the lake.

Get rid of her.

Nako returned to Japan.
Stay where you are.
The mother was separated by a powerful wind.
It'll take a while before he realizes it, right?
Did you see Tom last night?
Harry was only 40 years old.
Then I'll come later.
Tom refused blood.
I'm not often in Boston.
I've got a stone in my chest.
Tom, it's probably hearty.
That's hard.
I recently bought this book.
This depends on the context.
Let's not argue for contradictions.
He doesn't seem to be able to swim.
Tom is much older than my father.
You're wise.
They're not a threat.
Tom speaks a lot, but when he speaks, everyone listens.
Everyone here?
Mary threw a big card on the table.
He's reading.
Tom knew that Mary had a lot of money.
What color is the humour?
The damage he will have to suffer in bed.
The actress was well dressed.
He had to leave the village.
Be grateful.
And what he said is true?
You're my best friend.
I wanted to show him your book.
I'm sure Tom wasn't surprised.
You're aggressive.
Why are you late?
I haven't called him yet.
There's apple under the table.
Tom and I flew one plane.
I got them, too.
He's focusing on the morosis.
I thought you wouldn't object.
Choose for us.
Get up!
You want to see?
Tom killed a taburette from under Mary's feet.
Aren't you tired of me yet?
She's writing to her son.
She's not right.
Read on.
Tom never talked to Mary about it.
Tom is dealing with this problem.
I hate my job.
Tom's gone.
It's all your time.
I talked to someone on the phone.
Tom said he couldn't hold back from doing this.
I wonder if I can repeat it.
What you say is true.
I don't think Tom can help us now.
Thank you very much.
You need help, don't you?
Ija's not very good here.
Tom's working on this right now, huh?
We were on the lake shore.
You better not let that happen.
Please, biffschex with a broken cardboard.
He got a three-year-old from England.
I'm wondering if Tom has water rights.
Give me an example.
I just wanted to give it to you.
So you wanted to get from Santa?
Thank you very much for your hospitality.
Tom's going to the concert.
Everyone wanted to go to Boston.
I'm tired.
You're lying!
Here!
Her house is in the forefront.
Attention, please!
I'm the highest in our class.
So it was interesting.
That's great!
He's lifted the roof from one end.
Do you think eating genetically modified products is dangerous?
They're all shooting at the pool.
What do you want me to do with it?
Terrible.
Tom and Mary said they weren't guilty.
I heard Tom screaming.
Can I ask you something?
Tom wouldn't be happy here.
Tom, maybe not in Boston right now.
Thank you for agreeing to meet me.
My friends are seventy.
Don't waste your time.
A U.S. student.
Is Tom afraid of you?
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was used to being ignored by my parents.
Half of the students are missing.
I'll check it out.

Tom, with a great possibility, will be hungry.
You have a good city.
You'll never run away.

What do you want on your birthday?
The secret will remain secret.

Tom champion.
I know what you want to do.
When I broke up, I fell asleep.
Tom can't tell us anything.
Where's your mom?
This seems too simple.
Strauss don't fly.
You're going to Australia next week?
The room was room enough.
Tom said he's planning to go.
Tom's gone.
He's really looking forward to it.
Who's gonna take care of this?
Another lesson is simple.
I'm going to Australia for three weeks.
Austria played against Australia.
She's in white.
Does this book belong to you?
Tom said he wanted to hire someone with experience.
I have my head, my hands, and my feet, and, in fact, the whole body.
Tom brought Mary home.
Will Tom do this all day?
I'm crazy.
When did you learn to swim?
Can I talk to him?
Tom hasn't played for many years on Fortified.
Christmas is good for health.
And don't wait.
How dare you tell me that?
I was a little suspicious.

You think Tom's gonna find us?
I don't have time.
When does it start?
Come as soon as you can.
Can you teach me how to do this?
Did I ask you for help?
Cavi, please.
It's very likely Tom's coming.
I like to speak Russian.
Well, then I'll be a dick.
Let me tell you!
I love you and will always love you.

A Fruit or a Fruit?
In this way he made so much money.
Slavs!
Do you like school?
Tom's just trying to help you.
I'm working.
He saw a beautiful girl.
Tom went to the door.
So you don't have to worry about it anymore.
It's my bag.
We're looking for someone who can use the computer.
He's drinking coffee.
You can swim, right?
I'm still using the hand you gave me three years ago.
I know it's impossible.
Do you like yellow?
Tom once hated Mary, and now he loves her.
I'm just a line.
I never wanted to live in Australia.
Tom doesn't like cats.
Perhaps Tom has other plans.
Aren't you with Tom?
Tom didn't go there.
Mary blamed her parents.
Did you vote for Romney or Obama?
You scared, Tom?
The glass is full of milk.
They're mad.

I'm learning.
Wait!
Hey, where are we?
Tom also went to Australia.
What's that?
I lost my key here.
Where are they?
What are you saying?
Tom's home.
They're too picky.
You went too far.
I suggest you do this now.
Did you say 30?
I'll need a loan.
I'm happy I have so many friends.
I don't think you're right.
I was always interested in paranormal things.
I have a little book.
Tom told me I'm wasting his time.
I had no doubt that Tom would do what we asked.
You're not one of us.
What did you see in Boston?
I'm a little sick.
That's a complex question.
We're with Tom on one command.
That's quite unusual.
You're coming to the world, aren't you?
I kept reading.
I thought you said nothing was happening.
I taught my wife to drive a car.
This sign means that the answer is correct.
I was disappointed.
They live there.
It's Tom.
Tom ordered a pizza.
Why didn't you call the police?

Don't go home alone.
How often do you see him?
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
We're running from 10:40 till 11:00.
Did you fight Tom again?
It's a very good feeling.
Don't you want to visit him?
Please don't talk so fast.
That's not very convincing.
I'd like to know what you're looking for.
Tom's very romantic.
A woman on the table.
Tom knew I didn't want him to do it?
I never lived in Australia.
Last week Tom came to visit us.
I really thought Tom loved me.
Can we talk to you for a second alone?
Did you ask Tom for dinner?
I'm heavy.
If I were with you, I could help you.
It's the book I told you about.
Tom, could you not get up?
Canada's climate is colder than Japan.
Is this the right thing?
Are you there often?
Tom drank a beer.
Tom and Mary are always busy.
He just left, he opened the envelope.
We live near school.
Tom asked her if she was Mary.
I won.
You don't seem to like seeing me very much.
He's bigger than that.
Tom is waiting for Mary to come in.
I haven't done what Tom asked for.
Tom asked his questions.
The cup was full of apples.
I asked Tom to sing my favorite song.
I hate my parents.
I don't think I'm going to dance.
In exchange, he gave me this.
What color is it?
I'm sick of it.
Tom did his best to avoid Mary’s viewpoint.
That's another thing.
How did you know this would happen?
Father loves you.
You play football every day?
I'll start with the fight...
Tom's got a toothache.
I'm not busy either.
I heard something.
My house is your house.
This crowd is hungry.
Many people have a lot of friends.
I'm not an angel.
I liked it even before it got hot.
I saw the body.
Go help us.
None of the people I know can do this.
I didn't hear your nickname.
Was our teacher in Germany?
It's winding south.
The students wanted to smoke.
Don't you hear that?
Who opened this island?
Tom's taking care of him every day.
Did you get out in the morning?
He decided to go with us.
Tom has a lot of money, but he doesn't have friends.
It's forbidden to park there.
I'm not sure I understand what Tom meant.
Tom was born there.
It's a quote from Don Chichota.
I think I might have a better way out.
Is there anything you want to buy?
I don't know.
He's very much like his father.
Why do you hate Tom so much?
It's time for you to get married.
Tom has everything he wants.
I'll be right back.
Never read comments on the Internet.
I'm wondering if Tom can stay with our child tonight.
Who told you to contact me?
Do you like broccoli?
I'm twenty-six.
She couldn't do that.
The first month of the year is the moon.
I don't think you're right.
I still have questions I want to ask you.
I came to Japan to see Kyoto.
Tom says you're still hungry.
It's Dad.
Reading the books is very interesting.
Tom's very good at food.
I never heard him speak English.
Trees are easy to burn.
Let him help you.
My skull hurts after food.
No one's seen us.
I won't do it without you.
Things are better than words.
She lost consciousness, but within a few minutes she came to her senses.
One for all, one for all.
We're embarrassed.
Don't look at him!
It seems that the children are tired of swimming.
Are you hurt?
They were very good at my account.
It's yours.
Tom said I should do this on Monday.
Speak words in alphabetical order.
Tom told you what to do?
Don't turn this off completely.
What's in your hand?
How about dinner?
Lodo's down.
Aren't you surprised I'm here?
There's milk in the refrigerator.
I'm not alone anymore.
I'm not really sure.
Please leave my things alone.
That's not gonna happen to you anymore.
I'm very busy.
Thank you.
Your daughter's a comfort to me.
People believe what they want to believe.
You don't listen!
You don't work here anymore.
You're good?
Tom must be the first one.
You're probably wrong.
I'm very competent.
The airport doors were already closed when Tom arrived at the airport.
He deserved it.
The apartment was painted in Victorian style.
I'll deliver your message to Tom.
I'll do it against you.
I knew Tom was waiting for us.
Tom's got a car.
Why do you think Tom can't do this?
They won't tell us anything.
That upset Tom.
I lost my glasses on the beach.
I've never seen you smile.
You'll be with me.
I'm learning.
Where's Laurie?
I haven't been in Boston a long time.
I'm never working out.
Unhappy accidents of the past.
It's my first love.
Don't stop playing.
I want to wait for him.
The guy's brave.
Students like it.
I'm sorry, who's this woman?
I'm not always free for weeks.
People lived in villages.
Tom speaks French a little.
Even Norris was born in a house he himself built.
I'm guilty.
I love the dark.
I need you to be right there.
You're his brother, aren't you?
Don't worry!
Don't drink that.
The doors were opened.
He did it willingly.
His speech was one of those moments that affected me.
Tom helps his mother with dinner.
How much do you think he'd cost?
I'm a porter of help with the creation.
This book is not only interesting but also educational.
Tom, maybe he's gone.
I fell in love.
Go sit down.
Tom's grown up now.
Don't forget that.
Go play tennis with Tom.
When was the last time you spoke French?
I'm not your girl.
Shit!
Good boy.
There was money in Sami.
Tom allowed Mary to go on her own.
I wonder why Tom stayed in Boston.
You seem strong.
I'm sorry I couldn't help.
We hope that people like it.
Maybe he's wrong.
You're three inches taller than me.
The moon lighted the room.
Why didn't you tell me that before?
I sometimes fall, but I never seem.
Tom's not as hard as Mary.
Let's get out of the bus.
That's cute.
You can stop with us.
Tom said good night.
I've never kissed Tom.
Please look again.
The arrow indicates the way to Tokyo.
There's a fan on the table.
I'm glad you're home.

The logistic sugars of what kind are you in love?
One day you'll understand.
The plate came true.
I'd like to speak English freely.
I love being alone.
Some plants cannot adapt to the cold.
Tom has a specific sense of humor.
Don't worry.
Isn't it obvious who took it?
That's a funny thing.
Betty killed everyone.
He'll get it.
Tom said he didn't have to hurry.
It's a French word.
I've been watching this movie for a long time.
He's gone now.
Tom is right.
She beats cancer.
I want a lot more.
You don't have to let him do this.
Tom gives us good advice.
It's easy for me to drive this car.
I've changed my website's label.
I have eight brothers and sisters.
You were busy?
Show her to me.
Why didn't you tell him?
Tom won't try to do this.
To start a fight with Tom was no longer such a good idea.
Tom thought he had Liverpool in his heart.
I've gone to bed.
I kissed Tom yesterday.
Why did Tom kill Mary?
Tom said it wasn't.
Let's stop this fucking discussion.
Tom cleaned the apple.
Tom didn't read the report you wrote.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Nobody would help me do that.
You're an Italian.
What's she like?
Mark's passport was issued by a black thief.
I think he likes you.
This magazine costs all two pounds, including delivery.
I'll feel sorry for you.
I've been on my back with Tom.
They love each other.
Come in tomorrow.
What comets did you eat?
I saw Tom hit the car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do this.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
I know what a sticker looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees that.
I didn't have the bus.
I objected to this proposal.
Mary already did what she was supposed to do.
I've been watching Tom.
You guys booked a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like it.
Use them all.
You're right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off the cell phone.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
It's like going to a picnic.
We couldn't buy flowers at the concert until they got money from our friends.
Tom phoned Mary this morning.
Maybe something else.
Tom refused to let Mary go home.
Tom doesn't play very well in tennis.
I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
You need him here.
We've finished the oil.
What do you think they want?
People living in the area cannot know how to enjoy life in the village.
Mary has a good eye.
She gave me a book on Rizdov.
I want a schizburger, a hand and a cardboard free.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
With my account record, there's a problem.
Tom happily agreed.
I think Tom's wrong.
All right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do this.
Who has no reason?
Your songs make professional singers feel ashamed.
You know Tom's wrong.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need more than that.
Oh, my God!
Tom's down.
He was great.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
Last week I had a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to get out of here!
You've been lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely that Tom will forget how this is done.
You're drinking?
Will Tom do this with you?
You don't sleep?
The meeting started on Friday.
Mary said she liked to do this.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I was in Tokyo only once.
I got an account for electricity.
What color is his light?
Last week, I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be okay.
He cut himself off with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning to do this.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Isn't that a good thing for you?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would've written it to you.
I was born in March.
I'm fine, too.
I'm happy.
A small cup of coffee cost two euros.
I wonder if I can do this again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning on doing this?
We're satisfied with the decision.
This afternoon is raining.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
He stood in the door.
She cried aloud.
Tom fell into his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is this Mary's husband?
He's learning himself.
A Witness who has seen everything in his own eyes appreciates more than ten witnesses who have heard it.
Remember who I am.
Tom came back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom's done.
When I went to the room, she was playing on the piano.
You're very kind.
Where are your ways?
They didn't lose hope.
Tom dropped Mary's egg.
When do you expect to come?
Tom's been exaggerating his sister.
Tom went to the library.
I need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the dinner is going?
Mary's high.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a cross.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this van with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'm going to go.
I don't want to.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here today.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I'll take care of your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
It's almost fresh.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very curious.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very sweet.
Are you scared?
You ruined my life.
We need to learn a secret language.
Are you planning on staying longer?
When are you planning to go to Japan?
My kids at school.
I put my suitcase on.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother, John.
Is there anything you want to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant village.
Get the hell out of here.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We were able to cross the river.
He's obviously in love with you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom is younger than you.
I'm a French interpreter.
It's very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane is equal to nine.
Tom is free to speak French.
John stopped the tiger and shot two Levites.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom's gonna beat our ass.
What happened to Tom?
It's a barbecue.
I've got a lot of hours.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait for the party.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
The next month Tom leaves Boston.
It's gonna be hot.
Let's get some rest.
Each year, millions die of hunger.
I was interested in what Tom wanted.
The list contained the wrong address.
It's the last step.
Who's going to fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all chocolate.
They moved to another religion.
I need to be more careful.
I jumped them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What is he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do this?
We were able to save them.
He's a wonderful person.
I'm just shooting.
Mary said she never studied French.
I think I'm buying a new car.
We're guilty ourselves.
You're so sweet.
It's going to cost some $50.
I knocked on the door.
His theory deserves attention.
We're sorry about Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
It's very unhandling.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
That's right, Tom.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You slept.
I've done everything I can't do.
I like to write.
Kiito is an excellent city.
The next month, I'm going to be sixteen.
Do you think it's possible that this will happen?
Calm down with your dreams.
What time will your final lesson be over?
I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where did this book come from?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing this.
We should help him.
The rain went all day.
I'm sorry about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You have to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could handle this?
Why did you buy the flower?
The clock is ten minutes away.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Say it quietly.
The sun shines on the sun, and the night is the moon.
I got her.
You were right earlier.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have a problem with the chief.
It's banana.
Tom is probably being punished for what he did.
Is Mary your daughter?
London called a tuman.
I'm so glad you're here, Tom.
Tom's weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
You're usually traveling around the corner?
You're supposed to be stupid.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to conduct it.
Get out of here.
He's in the kitchen.
I'm so sorry, don't be so bad.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
Brazil is Brazil.
What I really want is to rest.
I still need to pay for the phone.
Tom is able to cook.
The music makes him nervous.
What languages do they speak in America?
You deserve a rest.
Here's the fresh ones.
In Tom's big eyes.
It's seven colors.
I think that's why you shouldn't do this.
He's getting tired today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to him with open mind.
Aren't you on your own tonight?
Tom never had much to learn.
How's your wife doing, Tom?
I'll accept your proposal.
Bill has many friends.
That would be unfair.
There's gotta be either you or Jane.
In your place, I'd ignore it.
Tom's just gonna be here right now.
It's the most travel tunnel I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
You think I'm kidding?
Today I was very tired.
I'm right.
Happiness is not to be ruled by a lot of things.
The news spread throughout Japan.
Tom showed up on the mountain.
Taxi's here.
I heard him fall down the stairs.
It's mine.
How wonderful!
Can you read the package?
I know Tom well enough.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's gone, isn't he?
I'd like you not to be such a fool.
Did Tom give you something for me?
I would never have done this without your help.
I've always had coffee and vegetables for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't wake up.
I'm the best.
How did your exam go?
Can I pay later?
Did that just happen?
Mary didn't take a passport with her.
Did you hear me?
The truth is, I said the truth.
I'm sleeping!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.
Can you lend me a penny?
It's your life.
Tom said he wanted to drink.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do it.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I'm so ashamed.
I've been thinking about the details.
Tom said he didn't want to do this.
Let's go to the ocean.
Do you know what the cause of the problem is?
Where's Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
I have a good appetite today.
We're still in our new house.
There are only two endless things in the world, the universe, and human folly, and I can't be sure about the first one.
She said, "I'm very happy."
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
Whatever you have, you're late.
What have you been up to?
Can't we go faster?
We're not just footballers.
All the meat's gone.
I was born like this.
Tom and I were on the train.
He came home late at night.
The National Health Service of Great Britain has today made a recommendation on the Coronavirus.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Tom and I drink the same.
He could not resist the urge to buy another cigarette.
There's a secret passage.
I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She's rude.
I thought Tom would refuse to do this.
I love you.
Where do you live?
Tom was a little upset.
He signed a check.
Hey, how are you?
Password is "Muiriel".
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads the novels.
Get the hell out of here.
You're my friend.
He's got two cars.
They realized.
No problem!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
Can you borrow your legs?
Thank you for helping her.
Tom confirmed that no one had suffered.
Demas slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
They went to the zoo.
I was shy.
They're not rich.
Take my hand, we're both building a roof.
Tom said Mary was panicked.
One of them says it's wrong.
Harvard was founded in 1636.

What are you doing about it?
I'll meet her requirements.
Forget about this suspicious event.
Please take this.

I think that's why he likes it.
I go to the library at least once a week.
I want to drink some coffee.
How did you learn French?
We already know what you did.
The kid's getting out of the clinic.
He's having a fever for weeks.
Did you ask Tom?
Thanks to God, everyone was fine.
We're an ideal couple.

That's what you really need to do.
Tom's still in Boston.

I did the same.
What are you gonna do tomorrow?
This is my wife, Edith.
This student is an American.

No one's seen us.
I'm waiting here.
As a teenager, she lived in the capital of Tokyo.
Does that mean anything to you?
It's my e-mail.

I don't have to sleep.
It's Holy Valentine's Day.
I don't know what to do.
Tom's taking the day off.
Tell me the truth, please.

Tom and Mary are avoiding John.
I don't remember anymore.
He loves Mary very much.
Tom's cooking dinner.
Sami's dog is smart.
I can't take pictures from the camera!
I was impressed to learn that I had won.
I'm wondering if Tom told Mary that she should do this.
All dogs are animals, but that doesn't mean all animals are dogs.
A person who can only think of one way to write a word is obviously lacking in imagination.
I'm sure he did.
That's not what Tom did.
Where's the nearest metro station?
Tom ran through the window.
You don't hide anything?
How's it going?

I have a lot of friends.
You can just do this right now.
No speed limit.
Tom's a little bleeding.
That's what you have to do.
I probably need to spend some time with Tom.

That's good for you to come back.
You need to sit with Tom.
I decided it was a good idea.
I just gave it up.
I don't see them.
Aren't you a bastard, too?
It's part of the system.
Why did Tom sell his car?
This bed is for soup.
They took me to Boston.
Tell me you want Christmas.

Go slow down.
Did Tom bring someone to the party?
Today's Christmas.
It's a yellow beauty.
You said it was important.
Can you help me?
Tom said he was hoping Mary could win.
I think they're students.
I just want to say that you've done well with your job.
I think you said enough.
I'm a client.
I'm very curious.
You're crazy.
Tom won't worry about Mary anymore.
Just answer now.
I had a suspicion that Tom was going home.
Tom hasn't done this since last year.
You're done getting hurt?
Aren't you Mary's husband?
Do they speak English?
No one saw Tom.
The police continued their investigation.
I think I know what Tom would do.

What will you do today?
I love this game.

It's our position.
I always wanted to meet you.
I'm not in the middle class.
You don't have any idea how to make it public.
She's upset.
She can't write or read.
It's down the street on the left.
Did you tell him what you were buried?

Tom says he's waiting for Mary to do this.
Kim Tom's cat.
Tom tries to understand what he is doing.
Is this a positive news?
We're not very hungry yet.
You see Tom on the left?
Tom doesn't do everything he can.
I'm sure you'll find a good job.
You're a god.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Perhaps this world is a hell of another planet.
He caught a metallic stick and pressed it between the big and pointed fingers.
It's delicious.
Women are so wonderful!
I've already considered this idea.
Tom hit me on my head.
Why do I care?
I can jump on my legs.
Do what they say to you.
I'm looking for you.
Some didn't want to fight.
You know why Tom doesn't drink?
His book made me nervous.
I don't believe Tom's coming back.
I measured the hats.
Tom is getting older soon.
Tom said I had a terrible look.
I talked to Tom a little bit.
"When will you come back?" "It's all about time."
Am I jealous?
That's the name of Scotland.
Is it a hot-deck boat?
Thank you for yesterday.
Don't you see that you need your help?
I'm not a soldier.
Tom's wife told me he's not home.
I bought Tom's watch.
I didn't say anything.
Don't fight me.
It's like it's usually on the job of stealing.
The man who helped me was Tom.
I'm on my way.
My dog's name is Ken.
I was just.
When did I tell the truth?
I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to draw cards.
He's hungry.
What's the computer?
I'm not free.
Did you sing yourself?
What are you doing?
Tom decided to do this.
Your medicine is ready.
I thought you were interested.
Well, every one of you, huh?
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.
Tom, live.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was an alien, and she was treated as an alien.
Karen went there alone.
Do you think I'm upset?
The girl we saw was Mary waiting for someone near Tom’s house.
Why don't you stop smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He asked himself why his wife left him.
I think I put a lot of sugar.
Can you throw it in the pockets?
I know how to do this.
Did Tom come?
I don't need dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can take 300 people.
I drank to that pig.
She can ask questions and answer them.

Come back soon.
He's incapacitated.

He's unstoppable.
He's sure it's a test.
Tom voted for the proposal.
Tom told you how much time it took for him to do this?
Let's start!
Watch out!
I'm totally exhausted.
The prospects are not too clear.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm impressed by the literature of the Devil.
The point is that she does not have enough experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their son John.
wondering if Tom's actually going to Mary's concert.
Tom said he's been through the past exits with that?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's do nothing at all.
Tom wants his father to bury his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm D-J.
I hate Christmas.
Was the sin enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
The child's lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to hold on.
We're all right.
My glove's been stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're gonna win.
The situation becomes worse and worse.
He's talking.
The surface of the windmill is an unequipped space, so it does not comply with the rules of the ecliptic geometry.
Talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're two older than me.
The journalist was stolen by the terrorists.
I let the cat go.
I hate this city.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
The programming language is his hobby.
I'd like to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many hours do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
So he doesn't like to eat fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom's very impressed with you.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to get his clothes off.
I need that money.
It's my nightmare.
Tom's gonna cry?
So you would want to be taller.
I need to help my mom.
His book made me nervous.
You guys?
It's not my idea.
You have a plan, don't you?
He's playing.
Tom's not in town.
I've got a feeling.
The next year will be worse.
Mary's in a bad sweat.
In love of a terrible smell.
The meeting's over.
You should have done this last year.
I thought I couldn't do it.
I got an old car.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
They went to the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockeyist.
We went to the forest in search of trees.
These tables are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small branch of coffee costs two euros.
Parental love is more than all else.
He was pursuing an evil course.
I was working at the restaurant.
I'm not sure.
It won't be as boring as you think.

Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat now.
About a dozen jars were broken on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She missed school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom, I don't think I should do this.
State debt is rising.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom, he'll probably never do that.
It's a lion.
Get down!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a monster.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still got a bike?
He's talking short.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to slow down.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows who could do this.
I'm an interpreter.
You've had a good time, haven't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do this.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends a lot of time online.
You're amazing.
Tom said he'd get better.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't do this.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's gone in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
The computer can count very fast.
You don't need it.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What time is it?
I am thirty years old.
Tom won't worry about you anymore.
Do you want another tea?
It's a Japanese lion.
What did you eat for dinner today?
You can't even change the papers.
People still use webcams?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she left school.
This word is derived from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
He's sick.
Don't worry.
The car's over there.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
No rules.
Leila was so excited.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make salt from cheese?
Tom knew what Mary knew.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
There's no doubt that rain is coming.
Tom didn't mention Australia.
Apparently, Tom and Mary were more than just friends.
We actually went to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than I am.
Better or worse, but television has changed the world.
I'm a little tired.
He answered my question easily.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love children.
Who left?
When does she come?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad I did it yesterday.
Is Tom still living near you?
I wanted to touch Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't leave the stone.
She's got a dog?
I was a monster.
Don't beat me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you often meet him?
Tom would like you.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You're gonna stop.
She's been waiting for him for years.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
That was 2,000 years ago.
Tom, it's probably gonna take care of this.
It must be the right color.
Tom's very hard mom.
After a short peace, the war was fought again.
It's better not to trust him.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
I'm sorry, you couldn't give me sugar?
Where exactly is Tom planning to build his house?
"Where's my notebook?" "On the table."
I don't think there'll be any problems.
Did Tom break up?
You need to wake up.
You've got a green one.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing football.
How does it all work?
You're very creative.
Come on, guys.
I'll fix the cheese.
When is he expected to return?
I've had a good time.
He's not better than his sister.
Tom is Mary.
I'm making a lot of mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It would be good if it was 28 hours in time, right?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would like this disaster not to happen.
We do not expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I'm not explaining here anymore.
We didn't find the boy.
Go to the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call him.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's di-jay.
Soon Tom will learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They're capable of fishing.
Tom left the room.
I'm still busy this Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom speaks French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thinks he can do this.
I don't have a book.
The next true story.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job's very expensive.
He's, like, a human robot.
Answer the question!
You need to go to the hospital.
I can't find any clues.
It's a piece of work.
It's not Tom who asked Mary to do this.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
It's often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did I vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
That's funny, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, and there was the Gran-pry.
Tom's writing to the daughter.
Don't remember.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do this.
English is not my family language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm hungry?
I'm too rich.
What's her name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So you don't have to do this again.
They've lived for ten years.
Tom got to Mary.
Her neighbor cares for the children until she's gone.
I'm cooking now.
Did I see the passport, Tom?
You want to dance?
He is often late.
You remember that summer when Tom hit his head?
Why did Tom do this?
I know this girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't go with us.
I've got thirty eyes.
If I don't do this, Tom will be upset.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Isn't that what you're writing?
The big tree fell on my way, and when I left, the road broke down.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold you're looking at.
I have a lot of friends.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
You didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you start to get tired?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still burn?
I won't work for you.
I can do this for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I tried to do this myself.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought his son a new sandwich.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, who was born the same year that I was, and now she's preparing for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you do your homework?
Monday may be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you need to help him paint a park.
Why do people act like big monkeys, and instead?
Can you help me?
That's crazy.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I put the documents on the bus.
It's going to snow today.
She's been working.
The motusk broke when we went up.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Is Mary not going?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to take him to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how it is done.
Don't you see anyone?
All the lights are busy.
I didn't make a decision.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Close the door.
I won't talk to Tom French.
The apple does not fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Uncle is your father’s brother or mother.
You know who they are?
In her red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was in Ginsach.
See you after the mirror.
I'd like to ask you a question.
It's my grandmother.
It's a kite.
This is my bag.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do this with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you for all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Who are these books?
You want to do this, huh?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom's playing a dog twice a day.
Let me look at this book, Tom.
Japan’s main islands are Hokkaido, Chicago, Hong Kong, and Cussa.
You're probably very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do that.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do this now.
How can you be such an expert?
I won't help you.
I'm tired.
I'm not a monster.
She's hurt her eyes.
No one can be compared to him in tennis.
Who did I ask you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We got our office equipped with computers.
I need to pay it at the same time.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's dead?
Aren't you planning on leaving?
I didn't do what you blamed me for.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still in French.
Tom's gonna do it right now.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has a third more book than I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing shoes.
You can count on me.
His book became the object of criticism.
That's going to be great.
I'm so scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
That's much worse.
I'm in the shower.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do this?
Tom witnessed to Mary.
I thought you were gone.
Tom doesn't steal Mary.
Can I ask you what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you gonna vote?
You need to quit smoking.
I think Tom's hurt.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You're not exactly like her.
Can you play on the script?
Can you give me a sword?
Just stay there with Tom.
I think Tom's good to speak French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He was very popular among both students and translators.
You won't help with the tears of grief.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can take a good time.
You knew Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he receives his soul.
You're not young like Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom raised his ear.
I'll be right back.
The church is near the top of the mountains.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
I'll make coffee, please.
Tom is trying to convince Mary to do this.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell him he did it.
He speaks Spanish with a small French accent.
It's not yours.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't handle it.
She's got a good way.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom will come to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a Dutch - speaking man.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a monster?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
They're out.
You're letting him touch you?
You're a good woman.
There's hope.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
Tom poured Mary a beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play on the map.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The noses of the tongue follow the rules of their tongue, even if they do not understand them.
Tom's on vacation.
What if I press this button?
The thinkers set their swords against the elephant.
Nobody cares.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom’s wife is a Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do this.
I'd like to take the money away.
I'll cut Tom's hand.
They'll be all right.
Half of these apples are yellow.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You shouldn't worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom, did I vote?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do this.
Tom didn't even start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the park.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom's gonna want to come.
Don't run.
I'm Japanese, but I'm not living in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend the canicles?
This year did you get a gift from Tom?
I still feel a little tired at home, and so many things seem strange to me.
I sometimes have a memory problem.
Where's Mom?
He died three hours after the accident.
You speak Macedonian?
There's no need to talk.
Are you talking about us?
Tom is with me now.
Tom's all right?
I thought you knew Tom.
Very good!
You know why?
Check voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little off the chart.
Tom's not a hero.
Can I get a cab here?
Hurry up, 'cause you're late.
That's gonna be hard.
Is that what Tom always does?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You'll never break.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It's working, you see.
She left him.
Tom's safe.
I finally got water rights.
I'm not a student.
That's why it hurt Mary.
I'm just watching the news now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom is not rich, but Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite hand.
Everyone's late, except for me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I'm not going to shake the boat.
The money won't go away.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your effectiveness.
Didn't you have a car before?
You were at work?
What do you learn?
I'm sorry I ate those shots.
Good morning.
Please write your name to the olive tree.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going to the game tonight.
I was talking.
She went to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was going to happen?
What's up there?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, the Esperanza can be compared to a plastic tree that has been made into a fabric.
They all wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's staying in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so sad.
Tom has a good garden.
I know when you're going.
I know you just did your job.
We're gonna go get some pizza.
Tom said what just happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you tell him what I was kidding?
So it was awfully cold.
Tom said I was fine.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
A death sentence under torture.
It's unexpected.
Today, I need to do a lot of things.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little upset.
I want to dance with her.
Get the hell out of here.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?
Your sister is always wonderful.
This will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you hurrying?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him, you should take into account his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
That's his touching idea.
That's the right principle.
Tom didn't want to leave the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check it again.
Tom has a son-in-law.
I know it'll be impossible.
Do you have any of the headaches?
Children imitate friends rather than parents.
Tom's down.
Tom wants to play with friends over there.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus left.
Tom's in a black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where are you going?
Now they're nothing.
Did I try to talk to them?
Doing so was much harder than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt Tom could win.
Innovators fly and pick up our work.
Don't worry.
Bell phoned in 1876.
Are you going on your way?
Tom said Mary was fine.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, right?
So he still likes Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a medical doctor.
He went to the corner, and he didn't come back.
Collect your games together.
Doing so was much harder than it seemed.
I think I've got a bad feeling.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You must do what Tom tells you.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's hard to do.
Tom died.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but I'm taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the boaters.
I never lived in Boston.
That's important to me.
This boat was a sight.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I always wanted to sell it.
Tom said that, in his opinion, Mary would not be.
You let something go.
I called him right away.
You seemed interested.
This will help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I love her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
There's two cars in Kena.
I realized what my mistake was.
I like the rides.
Phone doesn't work.
That's what we want.
Tom's in the sunglasses.
Tom's doing a good job.
All you need to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you get a suit for Halloween?
Tom's busy and he can't help you right now.
I don't care.
You want to see a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why don't you sleep?
Does Tom really think anyone listens?
You don't have to!
Tom, you can say, fine.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to go earlier.
I met him accidentally.
Why does she like you?
The problem is that solar energy is too much of a road.
I'm very old.
Tom's got a smile.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't mad at me.
How do you say "thank you" to Japanese?
She's sleeping.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
You couldn't open the door?
You got it?
This sheet is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.

I'm not you.
I'm sure this information is true.
Have you ever been to Tom's house?
Go both to hell!
You think it's my fault?
I helped him open the box.
This lisie must've got a smoke on her.

I'm smart.
Don't repeat what I told you.
Get the fuck out of here!
I have a headache.
Tom made you.
Our trip is stopped.
Your names have been deleted from the list.
You're sitting on Tom, aren't you?
They don't respect you.
Thank you for your cooperation.
I'll answer any of your questions.
I'm so stupid... I'm trying to explain to you what I don't understand.
Whoever's looking for him will always find him.
Call me tonight.
Thank you for your letter.
Do what you think you need.
Tom didn't tell Mary when he came.
You don't want that?
Most of the opposers did not vote.
I know what you're thinking.
Do you agree with their decision?

Which beach do you like to walk?
I'll wait a week.

You need your family.
Tom took Mary for a ride.
Does that suit you?

Have you done your homework?
It's not surprising, I agree with Tom.
Give me five days.
You want us to go?
I just learned a new word.
It was Saturday night.
Let's go.
Is this diamond real?
He won't hurt again.
Does Tom like oranges?
Tom has to tell you something.
You have to plan.
And worse yet, he recently began to drink alcoholic beverages.
I'm starving.
This is what we have to do.
Were the Witnesses?
It was amazing.
What's going on in Boston?
Be careful.
Bjoules make honey.
Tom got the money and ran.
Tom's not sure.
Tom's been wrong all the time.
Do you have your own apartment?
It's me.
You have to sit with Tom.
"Do you realize I love you?" "Of course I know that."

His name was Robert, his father's honor.
Tom, it seems to be an honest person.

What's your favorite TV?
Do you remember what happened that day when we met?
Can you help me with this desk?
Stop trying to fix me.
My father will be back in the beginning of the month.
They built the city.
Tom's just kidding.
The village needs your help.
Mary's not going on her trip.
I'm married now.
Can you convince Tom?
That night, I was sleeping well.
I'm done.
The solution is already in progress.
I'll go with you.
He's got two keys.
We'll do it.
Is that "yes" or "no"?
She smelled like shit.
I got out of the way.
Are you dancing?
You know how much Tom hates to do this.
It's a gift for you.
I told you a million times.
You can get used to everything.
Are you all right?
He's a bad guy.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
I don't want Tom to be sad.

I'm worried about what Tom's doing.
Don't break the mirror.
I don't know.
Tom likes headaches.
You really need to do this.
Why are you looking at this rock?
Tom can cancel any closure.
I just saw Tom once.
You ever see French movies?
Then let me introduce you next time.
Can we do that this week?
What language do they speak in Brazil?
I don't think you're right.
You shouldn't lie.
Is this here?
The city has a lot of high buildings.
I'm just in Beijing now.

You're hurt?
Tom told me that he really cared about what was going on.
School sports increased.
I'll read French today.

The basic social problem of the country is poverty.
Can you lend me your bike?
They're from Greece.
I need a miracle.
Well, I think Tom will believe us.
I'd like some more water.

I'm tired.
He agrees with me.
Tom's sure Mary's right.
I called him a cab.
This is all about it.
I could say from my first point of view that something's wrong.
His life wasn't worth it.
Where's the store?
It's one of mine.
I'm a mechanic.
Let's say hello to him.
Mary is Tom’s wife.
Tom made a list of what he needed.
They left the tree.
Mary's in her car, waiting for Tom.
He put his hands on him.
You don't have to do anything?
I shouldn't be here.
Is he still in my office?
You hungry now?
I need to talk to them.
What do I need to give him?
Tom's on his way.
That's a pretty big number.
Tom came home shortly before he began to study.
I'll try to fix it.
I lost my faith.
What you say is true.
He has a deep voice.
Bring the dictionary, please.
Tom's brave, and Mary's not.
How safe is this city?
She doesn't want to go after him.
You said I had to do it.
It's a trojan of miracles.
The Russian alphabet is no longer that difficult for me.
I don't want to have children.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was native.
He graduated from Tokyo University.
Who told you that?
Keep the doors closed.
What do you need?
If you take the child out on the street and show her a month, she'll look at the month, and if you do the same thing with the dog, she'll look at the palm.
Tom's always on time.
I'm sorry I did that.
You don't have enough eggs.
I assumed that Tom was Mary’s boy.
My car won't work.
I'll go if you go.
What's Tom doing in Boston?
I've been watching Tom.
Don't you expect me to sing?

Tom forgot to bring home his homework to school.
I'm sorry to bother you.

It's like somebody's been smoking here.
Ann may have seen a sweet dream.
Did you play baseball game?
He's a member of the committee.
You think Tom's still worried about this?
They're afraid of us.
You're not as tall as I am.
Why are you telling the truth?
I really can't help you.
It's bigger than it's enough.
Tom's hearty, and Mary's not.
Have you already eaten the pirate?
You've got a knob on your face.
Who asked you?
It's our fault.
No one's telling me anything.
He kept working.
They're moving.
Tom's gonna do it for you.
It's not my password.

Tom was never married, and he never had children.
Tom didn't intend to go there alone.

What are you going to do next?
You're old.
She has a long hair.

I'll always love Mary.
He apologized and listened.
This story is especially interesting.
Welcome to our restaurant!
Hold him!
Answer me, please.

I'm listening to the music of the horse salesman.
Did you tell him about Mary?
Tom promised me everything would be fine.
Tom was better off than Mary.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'd like to swear, but I don't swear.
It's not worth it.
If something goes wrong, it'll happen.
You better not wait here.
We were able to understand each other.
When you called, I didn't sleep anymore.
My car's in the repair.
What are you doing tonight?
They called by themselves about six o’clock in the evening.
It wasn't my suitcase.
I'm wondering if Tom told Mary she doesn't have to do this.
It's a bullet.
These new cars are on sale.
It's time to tell you the truth.
Football is my favorite kind of sport.
What kind of snake has the longest needle?
I'm the only one who doesn't care?
What's your son's name?
Is there a place that's gone?
Are you leaving a message?
I'm thinking about it.

I'll win.
Tom's planning to take pictures.
You love fruits.
Tom's got a lot of rewards.
Tom, maybe he won.

His wife followed him.
Most people who died of tobacco smoke were not infected with tobacco.
Tom's got a headache.
I'm going to stay in town.

Tom told me what to expect and see.
What exactly do you have against Tom?
I'm up.
No one listened to the talk.

You couldn't say "please," please?
Sit down.
We're around the same age.
Let's make sure it's true.
I was almost overwhelmed.
He's aggressive.
You think it's boring here?
Aluminum is metal.
Selavi.
You told him why you wanted to go to Boston?
I'd like to see it.
Do you know who said that?

What do you think?
Give me two minutes.
Everyone can make a mistake.

Tom's kidding.
I bought a book yesterday.
Fadl continued his search for food.
It was so delicious tonight!

The teacher read the book.
Why didn't you come to me?
You all right?
Leave him alone.

Did you ask your mom?
You have to keep your room clean.

Is this where you're taking care of?
They distributed the proceeds fairly.
We'll help as many people as possible.
This is ironic.
She looks forward to the future.
How high can you be under attack?
This cannot be explained.
These feelings are not true, are they not?
I always trusted her.
Let him wait!
How could you start without me?
I'd like to introduce Mr. Brown to you.

Can you tell me what that means?
You led me.
We talked till the second night.
Why didn't Tom do this yesterday?
It's a lot of courage.
I don't love her.
Why am I so upset?
Parents provide protection for their children.

It's a very handy cross.
I'm growing orchids in oranges.
I'm going home, Tom.
I thought I was crazy.
Who's this girl?
He's very tired.
I don't think we did something wrong.
I'm ready to start.
If I had time, I'd visit Tom.
Are you alone?
Leave him alone.
Can that happen?
Didn't you do housework?
Mary, of course, is beautiful.
I'm sorry, he's not here.
I often go to the movies.
Is that too hard?
I broke up too late.
I don't know if it's okay or not.
I'm your king.
Three points that are not in one direction are uniquely defined.
Just ask them to give it to her.
I'm sure Tom doesn't want to do this today.
I hope they won't see us.
Tom won't sleep.
I didn't listen.
You won't help with the tears of grief.
Did you ever target her?
We're innocent.
What's wrong with you?
Tom Consultant.
Tom is a man on earth.
I don't need her anymore.
I've already written about it.
I forgot your name.
They humiliated me.
It's a new trend.

I don't think he would like to live here.
Tom's home, right?
I know Tom's a wonderful boy.
It's my tube.
Tom said we could ask him any questions we want.
I don't want you to lose.
My friend's teaching around the corner.
To the Lote Tree.
I need to apologize to Ann.
I'll add the tops to my coffee.
Red, unlike green, is a sign of danger.

No one appreciated his sacrifice.
Why did Tom get upset?
"Where's your house?" "There he is."
I'm so scared.
We'll work tomorrow.
Where and when are breakfasts given?
He threw something at her.
She came home very late.
I saw him on the steps.
I really hope so.
I worship the cardboard.
She's three years younger than he is.
You don't understand.
Give me my money.
I'm lower than you.
Remember these rules.
I'm fine.
He's not going, please.
I didn't know you wanted to work with me.
I like to win.
I agree with you guys.
Tom's running a little faster now.
I've been in London for almost a year.

Please give me the paper.
Tom said Mary saw how John did it.
Tom’s car is the only one on the park.
I got it.
You speak very clearly.
If you spend too much time on the sun without sunglasses, you probably burn.
Do we still have to do this?
You can go.
That's what the question is.
I'm afraid of spiders.
I thought you said Tom didn't like you.
I should just finish it right now.
Tom has children and grandchildren.
You have nothing to fear.
Do you really think Tom has nothing to do with what happened?
Your thoughts are important.
I don't want to work at work.
Who are our closest relatives among animals?
I want to move to the village.
At breakfast, Tom likes to eat an uncooked egg.
We can't calculate what Tom's doing.
We will take note of your proposal.
I'm alive.
I was wondering if, in Tom's opinion, Mary wants to do this.
Tom lives here for a while.
I was very upset.
Our policy is to please our clients.
Don't talk.
Tom can still die.
I don't understand this language at all.
I'll be busy.
Tom knows Mary loves John.
Tom says he was busy.
Tom's not okay.
Nice to see you again.
My wife, Lydia, is a wonderful, intelligent woman.
Tom was here thirty minutes ago.
We bought this man's house.
I promised to leave Tom alone.
I'm sick.
You can sit here.
Did I buy you rice?
Is Hiroshi here?
They're too many!
In the past, I was on the beach.
Mary's very shy.
Are these your sunglasses?
Sometimes I don't understand you.
Have you done your homework?
I think someone's calling you.
I'm just finished trying.
I've already promised.
My name is Tom Jackson.
Japan is at peace with its neighbors.
They flew to Europe.
I didn't do it.
I came here to play tennis.
She's eating the game.
You don't believe who came today.
It's always a parent's fault.
I have to admit you're right.
How old is this dog?
Our house is too small.
But the boy didn't come for a long time.
Here you go.
We went to the same church.
I'm wondering if Tom saw this movie.
I'll kill you.
If you mix three original colors, it's going to be black.
Is he breathing?
The speed I can work with has limits.
Tom cares more about me.
Do you often miss dinner?
Yes, we promise.
I'm so sorry about the mistake.
I'm sorry, no.
Aren't you sad?
Shoot the creature to kill him.
You have to go.
I think I like it here.
You need help, Tom.
That's what Mary used to say.
Tom, the only one who can help you with this.
Why don't you take a password with you, just for every case?
His grandfather is still as healthy as his age.
Tom bought flowers.

I didn't deny it.
Water is important to humans.
So she was not interested.
Tom's good at playing hockey.
Where's the dog?
We can't leave her alone.
She can't swim.
He stood wide open with his feet.
This will be very difficult to do.
They won.
Where's Dad?
Please, hold your tongue.
I'm a genius.
Do you know who they are?
The world will notice.
Dealer wants to sell a car.
Gods do not tolerate infanthood.
You know her?
Tom's got an ounce.
He's very modest.
It was Tom's idea, not mine.
Aren't you Tom's girlfriend?
I can't let this happen.
He doesn't know French at all.
He's teaching now.
I don't think it's an art.
I don't want to be rude to them.
I was trying to tell you.
You said it an hour ago.
Why didn't you tell him you couldn't do this without his help?
I heard you kissed Tom.
Go! Go! Go!
Maybe I was wrong.
Tom and Mary have already returned from Australia.
Do you understand French?
I bought it that week.
Apparently, Tom is not talking to Mary.
I have to go tomorrow morning.
I knew we could find you.
She likes the girl.
Do you have anything else?
I think you're telling the truth.
I can't answer your question.
Tom said he was interested.
I often have bananas.
Mary was looking for her hand.
Who's your favorite sportsman?
Temperature's falling.
Mozart died in 1791.
Mary lost her hand.
How much can I keep this book?
You know what she wants.
It's a cell phone.

I want my key back.
This can happen to everyone.
When am I supposed to do this?
His appearance has changed so much that you may not know him.
Six plus four is ten.
I can't swim well.
God forgive you.
I left the dictionary below.
Tom worships the pizza and the fries.
I've decided not to do this.
I broke your leg.
Today's second sex.
How many times do we do this?
Is that your money?
Tom was a brave soldier.
There's nothing going on with Tom.
Tom really loves you.
I was very happy to receive a letter from Tom.
We work every day, except Monday.
Is that really a spaghetti?
You're the heart of Tom?
She asked him to turn off the light on the exit.
You can't hurry.
What's the boy's name?
I'm always up to half an eighth.
That's what I asked you to do?
That's what Tom finally did.
I'm tired of playing.
Are you French or English?
He's back in line.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

We didn't know what to do next.
We took him to a hot spot.
People have abandoned their political rights.
There's a kit on the table.
Tom was Mary's first teacher.

That's why you bought all this?
When Ken’s parents get upset, he always protects his mother.

Sometimes the dog is a dangerous animal.
Oh, please, don't say that.
Wesna is my favorite bride for the year.
I think that might happen.

Did Tom really tell you that?
The Sami glasses are in the garden.
We're trying.

My phone number: two, four, six, eight.
Is there a remote station for the yacht?

I doubt Tom's coming.
He is concerned about what others say.
Tom got a sword.
Why is life so complex?
Some people are very upset.
I don't know how old Tom is.
Mary was the only girl in the club.
That's a complex problem.
Mary's at work, isn't she?
I told him to speak French.
Tom is a teacher, isn't he?
Tom's surprised.
I was trying to help you.
I didn't try.
No one's gonna take me to work.
Don't you want to have children?
Tea without ice.
Philosophy is not something you can learn in six months.
You want to take off the weight?

He sells cars.
They were my friends.
I found something very interesting.
I'm not afraid of your dog.
You live here?
Maybe, Tom's tired.
I don't think we can do this.
Tell him I'll call.
We're trying.
Tom shared Mary’s pain.
It's cool to play.
I can't forget her smile.
I hope Tom didn't do what you asked him to do.

Good job!

Look, here comes your turn.
This is my watch.
What are you looking for?
Life is beautiful.
It wasn't easy.
Do you like chocolate milk?
What do you mean?
You have renewed my faith in mankind.
How's your mother?
He doesn't believe in evolution.
I hurt my back.
Where were you working last year?
Your secret will be safe with me.
Tom would've written you a lot.
He came personally.
I really want to eat.
Tom died that same year, as did Mary.
We went to the street.
I think the exams are a song of education.
Very cold.
That's why you came back from Boston, right?
Did Tom believe that?
Actually, he was never in New York.
Tom thought that Mary and John might be engaged in a arms race.
I was pregnant then.
Here's your wall.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565.
I'm going to Boston with Tom.
I don't think you can do this.
First of all, you have to understand yourself.
I was there for a reason.
I'll wait here until he comes.
Tom has the ability to drive.
I'm reading novels.
I was going to tell him, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom made you.
I got up there about six.
I don't want to thank you, but I'm smart enough.
Does that mean it?
Can I give you a minute?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I wonder if you can be trusted.
What happened to her?
Are you drinking?
I'm upset.
When did he get here?
Where's your dirty shirt?
How's it going, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win the Europeans.
Where could Tom do this?
I think you're wrong.
I'm serious.
Do you have a passport?
I tried to forget my boyfriend.
Cats hunt the mouse.
You can go.

What kind of monster would Tom want to do?
Birds can see the magnetic field of the Earth with their eyes.
You need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
I'm hungry.
Are you planning on doing this?
Am I clear?
I'm free today.
Tom, perhaps they're sorry for what he did.
No matter what, Tom's happy.
There's no need to hurry.
Are you satisfied?
At first, I didn't believe him.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come on, please!
Get inside.
Tom can get rid of it if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
That's really absurd.
Tom is my oldest brother.
Tom told Mary that he saw John in the garden.
You always get up early, don't you?
She's always against herself.
They live in the same state.
My dog's following me where I wouldn't go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that in your place.
Tom's already in French.
The earth moved from the father to the son.
There's no trojan without chips.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, okay?
Tonight's a surprise.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do this?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He left his family.
Let's go?
You don't have to connect to Tom.
I'm hungry.
I'm the boss.
Tom's got a bad feeling.
You should go home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary were dancing all night.
Tom admitted he did it.
Tom can't drive the car.
Tom spent the day with the daughter.
Each student has his own party.
We were ready.
I'm worried about what they can do to me in court.
My family lives here.
Tom's listening.
I got it out of my hand.
Tom's good to speak French.
I know I'm learning a lot.
I went to fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The evening's over.
Unicicle has one college.
"Dad, look over there, shark!" "This whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very welcome.
I'm sick.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my mistake, not Tom.
The congregations have gone pretty badly.
This year's wind comes out of the ocean.
I saw Tom smile.
Gieda, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and kill this cop.
It's our car.
Hi, I'm Basir!
Tom bought Mary a trojan.
I'm sorry I did it.
Should I go to the hospital?
In her free time, she makes eggs.
I think Tom sings "cantry" better than anyone else I know.
He's drinking a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She'll worry about how she's dressed.
Did you see his new movie?
I'm good at it.
Why did he get away?
Tom said Mary's gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have supplies.
My unprejudiced opinion is that it's a terrible movie.
You're very elegant.
As you wish.
I could change.
That's real.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's in Tom.
Tom was a bosonic.
I did everything I could.
If you see an error, correct it, please.
We tried again, but we didn't.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure if I'm ready to do this.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
You're not crying for pain.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a wonderful day.
I need a break.
We want to climb up that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak English well.
He loved his parents.
Come on, I'll have to talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do this?
I hope you'll be back.
Tom wants to be a baseballist.
Love cannot buy.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What's this for the theater?
Did you see the white one?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom was not a very good witness.
I visited the grandmother.
I hate happiness.
I heard the door shut.
I can't follow you.
Mary's a great dancer.
My dad's from Osaka.
I want a massage.
Tom's such a lucky guy.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Have you been able to sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did this.
What do you think when Tom is here?
Are you going to sleep tonight?
Is that what's going on with you?
Are you meeting someone here?
I'm in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate apples.
The square root of two is an iridescent number.
He's small.
Don't you know what's going on?
Bad thoughts lead to bad actions.
Did you get a fan?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have a copy of this purchase?
Tom seems a little embarrassed.
We can't swim without water.
I can't pick up my thoughts.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in the village.
I would never have.
I speak French freely.
Tom wasn't mad at this time.
Push me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He drank a lot.
Tom claims he's satisfied.
How do you feel now?
How many boys in your class?
It's a big apple.
Choose a present.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The richest man in the world could not buy her love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new shoes.
The absence of the good news is good news.
Why are you late tonight?
Computers are wasting our time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm going slow.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I'm starting to cry.
We're getting married in June.
I'm wondering if Tom left Boston.
I left my bones.
A few pages of the book were missing.
I raised the coin.
I have to go to the meeting.
Tom never breaks a promise.
We must protect ourselves.
You know that Jamal and Sarah aren't very comfortable with each other.
Every student has his own party.
I spent 20 hours.
I'm still hurt about it.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's not your business.
Don't go.
Tom doesn't have any questions.
I learned to get to the corner.
I'm a resident.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
The news made her very sad.
I've got a lot of hours.
With New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I never killed anyone.
What's your name?
She keeps flowers in her hand.
Did you talk to him already?
We're used to that.
The old man's already nine.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Where did you get it?
We're done?
You from Boston?
Did you know her since 1990?
You do well to do this, don't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I take your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way of rest.
We were ready to attack.
When does the celebration take place?
Did she help you?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything about what we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom told us the truth.
Tom heard Mary got married.
I've learned a lot.
How much does this parasite cost?
They're both mixed up.
What happened?
This can be done.
Tom thinks Mary's pregnant.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class got infected with flu.
Do you remember when you first heard Beatles?
Did I hurt Tom?
I want you to come to my party.
There's no toilet paper.
The word is silver, the language is gold.
Please come here and wait.
I love this football.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I've been through the past month.
Tom, maybe he'll still be concerned.
I'll go to the airport.
Don't take it for granted.
I'm glad Tom will help us.
Tom's gonna be here in a minute.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
You like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How much time does that take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see you again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I asked her to see her.
You Japanese?
He looks scared.
When did you come to China?
Do you appreciate what Tom's doing?
Tom showed Mary a house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
That's a great opportunity!
I'm wondering if Tom told Mary she had to do this.
I don't expect them to win.
I fell asleep.
How is this my fault?
So, Switzerland, you've already had a drink in there?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay for his loan.
Try to look at this from Tom's point of view.
The window has been opened.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom had a pretty sick look when I saw him last.
Is Tom still meeting Mary?
You didn't even laugh.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I'm usually working from nine to five.
Come on, I'll take this with you.
Mary saw a romantic comedy.
Get him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom's such a fool.
Do you want another cardboard ring?
Tom sat down.
Tom's got a hair.
I have three questions for you.
I met Tom several times.
Do you use a text processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot together.
Please move.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint the lamp in a red color?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, don't you?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not.
Go home.
I've met Tom.
Tom took off his lunch.
I'll arrange for you breakfast.
Tom, I've heard.
Who broke this window?
Your idea is something old.
