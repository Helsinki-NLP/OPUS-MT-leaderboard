The victory of the best populists in Austria is 29 percent
The fall in the two sides of the academic college and the significant increase in the strength of the best populist parties led to the first results of the Austrian parliamentary elections on Friday.
The Austrian Népart (ÖVP), where the current president, Wilhelm Molterer's position, suffered a serious loss, particularly.
In this regard, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) of Karintia Province, Jörg Haider, is preparing a successful return to national policy.
On the basis of the previous results, the country's most powerful party remains with 29.8 percent of the votes in favour of the Socialist Democratic Party (SPÖ), but in 2006 it lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
It was even worse than the OVP, which will lose almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These two large parties have already achieved the worst results following the war in Austria, and in contrast, the result is disastrous, according to Népárt, leading the previous elections.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP coalition was released, the population was significantly benefited from prior to SPÖ according to the public opinion studies.
However, the voters were apparently punished for letting the government collapse.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been heard about the possibility of a divorce by Mr Wilhelm Molterer and the current appeal.
The observers believe that this can be held this week at the next meeting of the Bureau.
This development would probably facilitate the renewal of the SPA and OVP’s higher education, from the outcome of the election.
In view of the strengthening of the two best populist parties, the Austrian Free will Party (FPÖ) first received 18 percent and the BZÖ received a tenth of the votes, but at the same time the Social Democrats expressed their concern about the return of 1999 when the people were represented in the Common Government (the FPÖ was still united with the BZÖ in 2005), which was still in favour of sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I expect him to return to Becks in national policy, obviously he is counting on this solution.
The Greens Party, however, has come into Parliament, which is slightly lost from its population, and the third from the political parties of the districts has returned to the fifth place.
None of the other parties went beyond the quadrilateral threshold and did not come into Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can be excluded
If it failed to solve the problem of Czech scientists reported for illegal abortion, Mr. Karel Schwarzenberg said that there could be some confusion in Czech-India relations.
The Minister did this in New York after he met with Pranab Mukhhardzsi, an Indian partner today.
"If this doesn't work out, then yes, there will be a certain delay," he said after the meeting, which was taken from the encouragement of Czechs.
Mukhherdzi said after the hearing that the enforcement authority could be placed in a difficult position in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from prison and was convicted by a court, the central government could deal with the local leadership of the county of Darjeeling, which is subject to the law.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kucher, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukhhardzsi said, however, it would be best to appeal to higher courts.
Then you could ask for a free position in spite of the guards, and you could wait free of charge, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that the partner had similarly addressed himself during the negotiations.
"He proposed an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to save him," said the head of Czech diplomats.
The only way to defend the whole case is to give the alleged "competence of legal aid" to the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indians are already providing them with such help.
"We are primarily interested in maintaining the best relations with India with my many years of absence.
This is recognized by the Indians," Schwarzenberg said.
According to the ČTK, its partner stressed the importance of the Czech Republic's problem of Czech entomologists.
"We are, in fact, in serious trouble with the involvement of these Czech scientists and their position under the charge," he said.
The question was whether the Indian party had received a promise to deal with the case, the Minister rejected the answer.
"I've received a lot of promises," he noted.
Czech judges in the war for the seafarers
It is located on the low electronic map, where Australia and nearby sea areas are visible.
However, it doesn't matter what the land is, but it's a point that disappears in the ocean's green.
"The lake belongs to Australia and with it are the neighboring seas.
In the middle of the area, just as you are the continent," says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who belongs to a third-party labour force group in the ENSZ Division.
Chief, Václav Mikulka Czech law, the director of the division, is paying attention to the explanation that he sometimes prepares.
It's working and breathing here.
The marines are rich in natural resources, yet they are barely known to the world.
It is possible here that oil, iron and other sweeteners are present, but still do not know living organisms, such as the key to the production of cancer.
Larger marines in coastal areas
The parties are actively seeking new areas under the new sea in our day.
According to the UN Convention, the same rights have been upheld in 1982 by the German Montego Bay.
First of all, this is the area of the so-called continental policy, which is usually within a few hundred kilometres from the parties to that country.
Such a country has exclusive rights under the Convention for all sources of continental policy.
"Supply, we have a continental policy on the part of the sea and a narrow section below which is the natural continuation of the land under the sea.
On the shores of the eastern sea, it is often two hundred seabeds. It is just beyond the border of the economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by that country to the Commission for the external limits of the Continental Code should be supplemented by a detailed scientific and technical documentation based on a number of cost-effective research and measures.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"We have committed some legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has already addressed five questions, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries mentioned were successful," he says to Mikulka.
In the world, Australia has been successful in its successful return, which has mainly expanded its country under the sea.
But New Zealand has also won - approximately 1.6 million km from the territory of the Commission's seabed area, six times larger than the country's territory.
In both countries, it's worth more than a million dollars.
The future benefits of the seafarers will be unestimable according to their expectations.
Other countries also continue to submit their requests.
This can be done within ten years from the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental policy ends, the Convention begins the territory of oceans declared "the common heritage of humanity".
There's no single country here anymore.
The right to production shall be conferred on the international institution established by the Agreement in this field.
"The seafarers, however, are not Clondike," says Director Mikulka, adding that "some parts of the world could be around in the world and we can enter into a contract."
Czehek the Csendes oceanon
Seafarers are part of the Czech Republic.
This once-external block is divided with other countries within the framework of the Joint Interocean Metal Organisation.
In 1991 this organization received its status as a "trafficker" as an investor in some other countries.
He was entitled to be born in the Black Clipperton zone between the Mexican, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Csendes Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is much larger than the former Czech Republic.
It's about the coastal area under the Tatra one-way.
"This can be produced in all 75,000 square miles.
The area is a rich place of polymetallic effort containing nickel, rice, cobalt and manganese,” says another lawist, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Robert Sandev, the division's macadeon worker shows another specific example.
He remembered a bourgeoisie, or a little fantasy about Golemet's life-threatening paragon.
There were special forces at the time of liberation
The U.S. government asked Germany for help to solve the drought, and the experts came.
When the situation was complete, the special units were ready, but they did not enter.
More and more details are being made of the release of a tenth European tourist in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces also participated directly.
In addition to the German Federal Service staff, GSG 9, the German Federal Police Airport and the Federal Criminal Office were also at the point of release.
According to the week-olds in the ministry, the German forces did not need this information at all, since they were allowed to fly their shields, and they went away when they recognized the signs of violent persecution.
The Vietnamese government accepted the aid granted by Germany in order to enter into force as a supporter.
"This has not been a success," declared the spokesman of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 19 September, the attackers launched a group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight of their unsubstantiated explorers in southern Egypt.
After a revolt in the southern part of Egypt, the tribes of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad heard of them here.
Exemptors are always out of the way, such as details of the release of the stamps or possible exchange fees.
In the past, they arrived in the building in Cairo.
Steinmeier told me that the released tigers are under the protection of German succession.
He did not disclose any details of his release.
At first, there was no information available in Berlin about their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" daily, five tourists and special forces are willing to arrive at Germany by the German Air Force.
The U.S. Board of Directors will avoid the medical package.
The U.S. Congress's low-cost economy has generated some 700 billion dollars for the money markets.
The Dow Jones is in my head.
In spite of 227 votes, the U.S. Board of Directors has rejected the Government's pension package for the financial markets.
George W. Bush did not receive a majority despite the call by the president of the United States and both political leaders, the programme that wanted to reduce the impact on the financial markets.
Supporters have tried twice to convince the critics of the need for $700 billion package during a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic party's negotiators, called on the representatives even if the plan was not popular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that has not yet been done."
The Dow Jones has more than 6 percent or 600 points in the vote.
The investors were worried that the public health package could be corrupted.
In short, the index has increased before the vote is finished, and then it will be re-entered after it has been publicized.
Experts are also counting on the international financial markets with additional serious turbulence.
To enter into force of the programme, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must be approved.
The organizers are registering more appointments.
Good evening for German travel organizers.
According to one study, the turnover of travel for the following months increased significantly over the previous year by over 30 percent in the winter season.
Despite the weak conjunctural appearances, the Germans did not enjoy their trip according to the study.
In the past year, the travel authorities published 31 percent increase in sales for the previous year - known in Berlin as the German Travel Association (DRV).
According to the GfK market investigation, the number of annual investments has already increased.
In October 2007 the travel authorities sent 11 percent of their sales to the ODR.
These results are based on GfK data that evaluates the monthly data of 1200 German travel offices and then extrapolates the whole market.
The Authority took into account the travel completed by the end of August 2008.
Because of the low dollar demand, travel to the United States was especially sought - DRW announced.
There's an increase in the number of reservations here.
Germany's particularly popular destinations include Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as their home markets.
At least I've been looking for organized roads - Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
Due to increased energy and food costs, the costs of the organised road can be calculated "more accurately for passengers than for organised travel".
Travellers can guarantee money, including bookings, among others, to Laepple.
It was also very good for the harvest rate of the summer months, so that the previous year could be a re-producing growth - even though another study suggested that the previous year was a less German tourist.
The First October
Unscrupulating ballermann sludges, literate corsorptions, and dozens of popular fames.
Debt in Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, of course, don't have much in common with each other.
He's a smart, tele-stimulator, and he's been talking about dirty behavior.
My hair's black, I'm a student, and I bought my clothes in the truck.
One thing, however, involves us: We're almost three minutes from Wiesnen, we're already being taken by photos and killed by memory cards - very exciting, and all my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's what we can do for friends.
It seems that the white-fashioned bird makes enough of its provision.
As Wiesn-tourist from the white triangle, my comfort is still limited to the population.
But coming to Theresienwie, it's not that bad.
Almost everyone wears a shirt or a leather jacket; no one looks face-to-face or Chinese - it's all right.
It's just my ring ring ring.
A munchen woman calls to my attention that I was wrong to tie the chain: "You're free, you're in the middle, you're getting better, you're in the back of a rope."
In secret, I left the table on the left.
"It's all right," she says, and her name.
Others have smaller surfaces around fine flortztechnics, and a simple flickalapo hole "I'm too involved in lifting up" with the retaliation, and without question they show their unveilable backs.
Young Bob, who shows the exhibitionist games, is called, and he first visited October.
What you find very fantastic is that you've been giving up "aaaaaaa."
After all, she told me that she was free from the contents of her earlier cheese.
Nearly one of the fires that everyone looks at.
That's why Bob was one of the famous trills.
Others are not so lucky to be free from alcohol.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the nurses are finally on their way to the place and take care of the poor guys.
Injectors always appear in groups - once a row of four cypels sitting on a table.
This works as in most Wiesn-visitors: Getting up, leaving a lot of time.
You know, if you're going to get a drink under the pony, you don't see it.
"These are the ones who are totally ready" - one of the chancellors asked me about my question, and then in the store.
The police called the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old woman who lost a car in Essex and died in the hospital.
With Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, the accident took place on Friday afternoon with Carole Paulson in Shenfield Roadon.
The romford Queen's Hospital was transferred to the hospital, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with a suspicious charge.
Since then, they've been released.
Turkish tagging diplomatic horizon
Before Turkey was in favour of joining the European Union, the European authorities expressed their desire to have access to the Turkish border.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps only 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest reliquisitions of the closed bureaucracy.
Hydarpasha designed two German railways, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu designed a new style.
At least the passports write this.
The building is surrounded by the end of the pirons, on the top of each tower, and looks like a German foreign town.
The hair is beautiful.
The whole building's a little cloudy.
However, in view of the internal character of the replacement label, it is evident what a large-scale company was the most powerful one.
The state was opened by the German Consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "last future" of the holidays from Damascus through Baghdad, is seeking to achieve the ambitions of the Middle East to be set up by the driver of today's South Arabia.
The German driving forces were united during World War I.
The streets were flooded by the Arabians Lawrence and the Arab parties.
The relatively remoteness of the surrounding regions, caused by the outbreak of the Cold War, disappeared.
The British war machine came out of Egypt, and cut down the Turks and German alliances from Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha's condition was not better.
In 1917 a fire-fighting plant was destroyed and destroyed the well-formed roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was a Saturday action.
It's been a long time since, and it's been a long time since, and it's been a long time since I've been through it.
At the same time today, he serves as a diplomatic horizon for the whole of Anatólia and the entire eastern region, in a symbolic sense.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the ACP - has been working on a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relatively remoteness of the surrounding regions, caused by the outbreak of the Cold War, disappeared.
The new policy is reflected in the agreement.
It is worth noting that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, Iraq, Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I moved to the capital of Turkey, for the night in Ankara, to visit one of the ACP-led foreign policy experts, the Turkish parliamentary representative, Suat Kinniklioglut.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours after the earthquake, which in time gave the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail" rhythm, I also arrived in the capital of Turkey. The new city is the symbol of the new, world state, which translates back into the past.
However, the AKP is a paradigm in the conscience of the Turkish consensual.
This has caused some suspicion in the past, especially in Washington.
I went with Taxi to the AKP headquarters, a ultra-modern building, stone and steel, specifically in the building designed for this purpose - which is in your growing foreign district, half ready for shopping centers and coffee shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have introduced a better-relevant politician in any other European country.
He's dead, he's wearing a knife, and I'm sure he's got another Blackberry with him.
"The party's foreign policy aims to assist Turkey's re-entry into its immediate environment.
The Cold War opened up the order," he said.
Turkey's out of three countries.
Today, he had to turn to him and calm down.
He couldn't choose one of the two.
He had to open both directions.
"But it's possible that it's easy to choose sooner or later?" I asked.
"Turkey has never wanted an answer."
Then he stressed what everyone I spoke to here would be able to repeat by means of: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea countries as well as with the United States as it is with Turkey.
It is as if they wanted to convey the message that - translated into meaning - with Turkey - all of Europe can be reached along the road to Asia and the Middle East.
When I was back in Hydarpasha's apartment, I thought about Herr Ritterre and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who had completed the construction of this beautiful building 100 years ago.
It would have been amazing if they knew that Europe's Middle-Celtic ambition is now in the hands of Turkey.
And while I was waiting at the door for the compromise to go back to Bosporus, it was thought that at that time Turkey was called "European Patient Man."
At least at least there was no question about which land you were going to need in this exciting country.
Memories: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: since 1962, the head of the Guildford music, Vernon "Tod" Handley, led the Guildford Philharmonics Zenkart and Korust.
On the basis of the city’s music plans, the next year, Proteus was set up a wonderful career for youth.
They could have stayed in the song for only 21 years, but when Proteus died in 1979, many of us were already in our late 20s - we were simply not able to change from the cross.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological reformer) was in line with the tradition and ability of the corus to deal with any matter that is to be presented to him - whether it is the magic, or a grave in the Messiah; without a temptation, or a great temptation.
Such a young Korean music diversity was often frightening and always exciting, and we were grateful to the person whose inspiration for the song remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tom told us, "Let's talk about the song ourselves."
He always said, "The singer knows what he wants.
Everything's in the case.
So sing it!"
Karmesteri's technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or over.
Whatever it was with the music, she always grew up with it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about this:
If you ever lived with a hunter who was supposed to be a hunter, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the two years he led the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
In the last four years, I've written more than 100 concerts, but I've never been a victim of prejudice, and I've often been involved with them.
Tod Handley was together with the greatness and love, which was very rare.
He hated the cowards who, in his words, were just "a well-known pair of galyptics all over the world."
He'll miss us a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes the following:
According to historian William Woodruff (September 25, 1946), "his studies of economic history were carried out in Oxford, and in 1950 he was promoted by the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was continuously prepared for the acquisition of basic diplomas, master diplomas and PhD."
This is from the artist's list of the artist "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, the economic history of Nottinghami was taught in the United States, and at the same time under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, PhD, completed the distribution of British rubber, which was then referred to as "The Brit rubber" in 1958.
In 1950-51, it was actually held in the United States by a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in 1952 it was held in Illinois, New York and Harvard universities.
He finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois in 1953.
You can't tell Woodruff why he's been building this time.
J. Vicente Resino
"J. Vicente Resino" "Flamenco and Life" is an offer because black-white, documentary-style photographs are excellent.
The simplicity, strength, and dignity of the people involved in the photos were given to me.
It's an expression that makes sense.
I'm going to resuscitate the alarming moments."
The second time the sales record in Denmark
On November, Honda started the second generation jazz production.
True, the front was already large enough to build the inside area of the new model, but it was even more difficult.
It's all refined with a pair of machines that make the management easier and increase the fuel storage.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
It looks like second generation Honda Jazz.
Although in the new Jazz view it is very similar, many internal changes have been made to it.
These include, for example, the innovative design, the new carts, the larger sizes and the new mechanics.
But before we cross the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz has been on the market for six years after the first generation.
So for the first time, we can also prevent Hondán from being able to renew this model as well as other manufacturers for a short time.
In Europe, Jazz knows less, but he decides to sell records on other markets.
Such a market, for example, was Japan, where in 2002, and this year in 2008, Jazz was the most wanted car.
In Japan, for example, almost one million dollars have been received from Jazz since the market was sold.
The second market was the Old Continents, with an example of nearly half a million sold over six years.
However, Honda wants to continue to increase trade in the area with the new Jazz.
Since the Japanese company has sold 83.000 Jazz in 2007, the target is 100,000 car sales for 2009 which would result in 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002 the Spanish market has sold the Honda 8000 barrels of Jazz, which represents 6.7% of the entire Spanish trade in Honda.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish disaster are calculated by an example issued in 2000 during a year's drought.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly facilitate the return of Honda's Spanish trade.
By the end of this year, the company's equivalent 22,000 examples are well established, less than 4000 in 2007 data, i.e. a 16% reduction.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market, which increased by 1.6% to 1.8% of the total.
In 2010, I would like to increase this rate by 2%.
According to Honda's hopes, this will be achieved by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, an attractive and compact size - 4370 mm long - hybrid, from which the Japanese company would spend 200,000 dollars in the world scene.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the increase in the Insight market would be made by the United States while the gap between the Old Continents and Japan is widening.
The introduction of Insight's commercial introduction to January after the official Valencian presentation scheduled for January is carried out in the first months of the year.
For the first generation, the new Jazz has become more complex in all respects.
The length shall be 3300 mm (five centimetres longer), the width of 1690 mm (two centimetres higher) and the duration shall be 5 centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
In contrast to the quality, 1520 mm is unchanged.
Along with the sizes, the road has become more narrow.
The largest inner layer is the new corrosion, the second is guaranteed by the medium-based fuel tank - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the so - called double-packed container, which is now 399 litres, is growing with the capacity of the first generation by 19 liters.
Although the above amounts relate to the type provided by the 1.4 engine, the 1,2-Honda Jazz container is 379 litres.
Some external changes can also be revealed, such as the background light lamps or the option panorama, as well as the easy access of the rear seats.
In addition, the opening of the doors for the back seats was increased to 80 degrees, with the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second generation jazz engines are also new.
At the start of the transfer, this small model can be equipped with two, 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
The use of both sources of energy through i-VTEC technology is preferable to the previous model, as well as a smaller sendioxed oxidation and apparent mechanical compatibility, while the engine provides excellent performance in all respects.
The 1,2 litre power supply is 90 litres of 6000 and the maximum pressure is 114 Nm 4900.
This engine - which was 78 litres in the previous Jazz - will consume 5,3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
And the other engine that produced 83 Lorez from the previous generation is now 100 Lorez.
The 100-year-old 1.4-year-old Jazz will consume 5.4 litres, and its output is 128 grams of CO2.
The "méhautto" that's on the trigger.
In order to develop pre-hazard technologies, Nissan is now in the natural world, precisely the need for a new invention from the world of the oceans.
Japan's company has designed a robot that's gonna take the risks after the fish's fall.
Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step towards developing advanced technologies.
Nissan Motor Co. Development Center of the famous Tokyo University in cooperation with the Research and Technology Centre, this small robot was built in Japan.
Kazuhiro Doi, according to the definition of the Technological PR and Research Marketing Marketing Director, the extension of the four-year safety belt of the Nissaan BR23C means further extension of the Nissan belt.
The robot is more fully capable of accessing the company's products.
During the flight, every time you take your favorite personal area, it's very similar to Nissan's security guard.
However, the role is much more important for the meh composed of meh, which is seen in all directions in more than 300 megs. As a result, the meh itself can be recovered in its own personal area without interference.
To disable the complex eye function, the measurements designed a so-called laser Range Finder.
The device shall identify the obstacles within at least 180 metres before the BR23C, calculate the distances, and transmit the signal to the side microprocessor, which shall be immediately transferred to the device for preventing injury.
"As a result of the observation of the obstacle, the small robot immediately changed direction following the motion of the wind with the movement of the wheels in a smaller or larger direction in order to prevent the flow.
The system, in particular, differs from the currently available tools, in this case the opposite engine is automatically broken down.
If it wasn't, the robot could not respond fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and project's principal.
By way of derogation from the brakes, the steering wheel shall not be directed upwards or downwards, nor shall it operate in two dimensions only in relation to the transformability of the axles, i.e. not in an infinite direction and as in the case of the brakes.
That's why Nissan used a rotational function in the robot to avoid injuries.
"This structure must process the data in a few seconds and respond to it.
There is no need to store the data or the intuitious logic based on previous manoeuvres, so it can operate only with a few thousand KB memory without interruption.
This may sound great, but it's not really gigaby, but we're not even talking about megabyte big memories.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology that will serve to prevent immediate injury, which can be introduced into the serial production cars within ten years of Nissan’s assessment.
The robot works with lithium polymer accumulators that are easier and more durable than the lithium.
In the future, the establishment of a unit with the GPS's operating navigation system can mean that the vehicle will be able to reach its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
I'm sorry about the signal.
We need to know that the U.S. Kinktári University has more than a lot of investment funds than they do in the past.
As the crisis raged, and the Americans turned into leaders of taxable brands that could not be questioned, they created a fun and informative net game at the Bad Credit Hotel.
It's the "Breast believe Hotel"... it's her hero.
The hotel and mainly the picture of the receptional buscomor suggests that let's think again, twice, the truth, more than three times, is actually now the time of the reception.
And most importantly, where we need faith, because it's probably the purpose of this.
The available information on the website is useful, but less detailed.
It's more of a mess than a big community.
But what happens if we add the game?
For example, in the hotel, you'll see our dream room.
Of course it's something, because we're not going to dream about buying a apartment.
Morgan Stanley opens his head for the MUFG
Morgan Stanley reported that he is providing part of his capital to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank pays $9 billion for the company's capital by 21% after the purchase of Morgan Stanley's shares was high on the market.
One week after the prior agreement was publicized, the two banks said that the MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's inheritances at $25.25 per unit, i.e. $3 billion.
The accepted price shall be more than 19 % from the value of the securities as shown in the book of August 31.
The MMFG is another $6 billion in exchange for securities of value which will provide a 10% share and exchange rates of $31,25.
Morgan Stanley's statement is based on a 29-dollar average volume of 29 dollars, which is higher than 28% of my current price.
However, Morgan Stanley's participation rate was around 6.79% in the middle of Greenwichi, and it closed at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to strengthen the way in which bankholding is carried out," explains John Mack, director of the U.S. company.
Morgan Stanley left his new status last week to diversify his activities while under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with the MuFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires greater caution from the companies listed in Wall Street.
In contrast to the conditions stated in the week, the agreement was amended in the last days: last week, Morgan only reported that 20% of its shares were granted to Japan for around $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the participation would be made up of all ethnic groups," explains Toshihide Mizuno, manager of the MuFG in Tokyo.
"But because of the current market and economic situation, we would have failed to minimize and avoid potential risks."
With the weighted average, the MUFG pays more than 7% of the book's value for Morgan Stanley's shares.
As a result of the transaction, I'm getting to a share of less than 20%.
On the basis of the agreement, the MMFG may transfer its primary shares over a year, if the latter’s trading volume exceeds more than 50% over a given period of time, i.e. around 47 dollars.
This ensures that Morgan Stanley can use investment opportunities, improve size and increase liquidity resources through MMFG.
However, the Group's speaker did not want to provide accurate information on the two new strategic plans.
Following the introduction of the MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its tax capacity rate by about 15% according to Tier I, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan has declared that his measurements have been "determined" since the end of August.
In the past few weeks, a great deal of effort has been made to the group because the price of the shares has fallen on it while the cost of ensuring the risk of non-payment has been lost.
This cost was measured on a weekly basis, but still remained at about 12% high.
One of the big investment banks still remained "supply" after the purchase of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, who announced last week that it came to $15 billion: part of this is from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company.
Rafael Correa weekly statement, Quito
The re-establishment of the public in the spirit of the twenty-first century socialism.
This is the joint plan for the Venezuelan Hugo Cávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correá.
Following her presidential and friend's speech on Friday, Correa developed her ideas on the new Constitution.
It was successful because 64% of the voters were voting in favour of the official results for 80% of the votes.
It is said that 28% of the population voted, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the votes cast without a vote.
50% + 1 vote was required for the adoption of the draft Constitution.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polls and one civil organization carried out an audit of 63% and 70% of the total number of "yes" votes.
On the other hand, Rafael Correa has already discussed the triumph of the constitutional plan for the weekend.
"The Constitution has shown its first victory," he said, and thank the Ecuadorans in Guayaquil, about 180 miles south of Quittól.
As you know, Rafael Correán Chavez, Morales and the Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, also congratulated me.
According to the United States Service (OAS) monitoring mission, the vote was held in a calm atmosphere. The main theme was a 444-point text, which included the "new socialism" principles protected by the President.
The proposed Constitution establishes the power of the State to serve the economy, including the right to "development planning" for a country which is based on the production of oil by foreign companies and the exchange sent by foreigners.
The chosen Korean legislative plan in 2006 also reinforces the authority of the State, which may receive mandate for at least two consecutive years and has the right to transfer national opinion.
Correa has already announced that she would like to live with this opportunity, and she is renegotiating for the Head of State in February 2009.
On the other hand, health services and the freedom of education have been included in the Constitution, and the President has already begun his entry into the country of 13.9 million inhabitants, and the wife of the people is living under my presence.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign teams in the country, which can be concluded with regard to the use of an Ecuadorian institution based on American drug-free measures.
Released in the 19th Century
He was struck by an Egyptian commander on the shoulders of men who spent ten days in pursuit of ten tourists and eight of them.
The tigers are now in Cairo.
Ten European tourists and eight islanders spent ten days in the wilderness, where they were safely transported to the capital of the island.
During the afternoon, the guards released the prisoners in Csadád, a unitary commander.
Apparently in good condition, about four in the south, they arrived at the Al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to the Turkish international airport.
The prosecutors were banned from announcing the press and immediately sent them to a hospital in Maadi, Cairo, where they were examined.
The Turks are "healthiers", and the human rights defenders are "not paid" - declared the Minister of Foreign Affairs Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
On September 19, the towers were destroyed on Mount Ouanat on the foot of Egypt, Sudan, and Libya, where they took part in a territorial safari. The group then heard of one of the 35 unknown divers.
In the group there were 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Roman woman) and eight primates: two foreign leaders, four soldiers, a border guard and the leader of the Egyptian travel agency organized by the Safari.
One of the 30 members of a special commander's crew arrived at two helicopters on the scene, where they were directly caught in front of the attackers.
"A fire broke out among the teams, the men killed him, the others left," said the leader who asked for his name to be heard.
He also said that there were 150 special sections sent from the British Brigade to Sudan, where they were filled with German and Italian commanders.
The current Italian diplomatic leader in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, stressed the role of secret agents and the special Italian action groups.
"We need to know that this outcome would not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret servants and groups," he said, without further details.
In addition, he admitted that they would have paid for the sins of the priests.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army reported that they had been detained while driving on a territory where the people were traveling, killing six of them (we also the military commander) and arresting two of them.
According to the military's statement, the passengers were in contact with a Darfur relief organization with the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately under attack by the organization concerned.
Lettres - Culture "great majority"
In the middle of the press and the current electoral campaign, there is currently a debate on financing culture.
That's all we can do.
But our cultural life is still a mystery.
Who will mention the word to clarify the number of small museums, manuscripts, old houses, and national historical monuments in the wake of the famine?
What political reason is there to remind the federal government that it does not care about its art and cultural heritage buildings?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that actually provide effective protection for our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has only transferred three and a half million euros to the Chinese castle in Loire?
The Constitution of our American neighbours also states that protecting cultural heritage is part of American culture, and this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and every government body.
Within the framework of the Fédération des Sociétés d'histoire du Québec, the association with cultural heritage, literature and genetics has more than 40,000 volunteers involved in the research of history, as well as the maintenance of large-scale private archives and archaeological sites, with minimal budgets.
While these organisations are protecting our heritage, and they are opposed to the latter of the flood, when owners and decision-makers are directed to our old buildings and our abandoned foundations.
When will someone be chosen to protect the historical and cultural heritage?
The Fortis bank is one of the Benelux governments
In particular, the Benelux states are helping the United States because of the combined impact of the American credit market crisis - firstly in the Belgian and Dutch banks in crisis, Fortison: the three countries are supporting the money and insurance institution that is also in the interests of Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's responsibilities for competition.
In the euro area, Fortis banke is the first major crisis in the wake of more than one year's global financial crisis, so the decisions made in the bank can be regarded as pre-emptive in some respects.
On the basis of the decision of the day-to-day day birth, both States are buying the bank’s assets in close proximity (49 percent).
The bank certainly sells all its interests, including, above all, the activities of the Dutch AGN Amrotoul, mainly insurance activities.
The Fortis participants began to complain last week, and on the second side of the week, serious crises were already taking place at the institution.
Researchers agree, however, that the bank is too big to allow you to get into trouble with 85 percent of your employees.
The company's papers were only about 12 percent at five, 14 years of age.
Since January, the value of the shares has been reduced by more than twice.
The group's total market capital is around EUR 14 billion, but the corporate managers say that this is not real.
The company, on the other hand, has caused maritime market uncertainty regarding the adoption of a $700 billion package plan for the destruction of Fortis.
The papers have grown a lot this week.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new manager for the bank's life.
The fund was also looking for private buyers, but no one's ever reported with an interesting offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors should not rest, lose their money.
There's still no panic around the bank's clients. They haven't praised the boys.
In Hungary, Fortis has his own bosses, and he has also purchased lichen companies.
Rock in the kitchen
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to conclude an insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of the data obtained by people.
Data protection experts are keeping data from becoming uncontrollable by the market.
"There is a data protection programme which is responsible for the use of medicinal products for the purpose of contributing to the person concerned.
This should be done independently, especially in the Rocket's work" – the founder of Richard Dicket, a program that is suitable for the follow-up to Washington Post.
The insurance companies shall take into account the health situation of the relevant company and the amount of the insurance fee and damages, and shall not be subject to insurance if the risk is too high.
He was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Dick has found a much easier procedure for ten years: from the medicine store, it is easy to find out what medicine has been purchased in the last few years, and this program has resulted in what disease and what health status it is.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol reduction, it is because you are practically unable to treat the high level of blood sugar, which is actually a higher risk category.
The programme also has a number of changes in trade, some of which also identify a risk-weighting number, so the provider is almost left outside the paperboard, even if the difficulties arise.
Some medicines can be used for more purposes, such as certain medicines, such as migraine or hemorrhages, but also for depression.
The latter is a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurance providers, not the predecessors.
Special companies were established to obtain and process data, and before receiving the necessary information from the medicines, the patient is requested to be included.
The authorities are now obliged to do this, even though they have not been punished for their edification.
Some companies are re-processing the results of laboratory tests, and they are also linked to the drug use data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
A number of companies have access to data, and the monitoring of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a special health data law, but it affects only healthcare providers and insurance providers.
Before the Congress, there is a legislative proposal which also provides the authorities with a control framework for data-service companies.
Dick Richard concludes that this is not enough: therefore he further developed a programme that would be responsible for the transmission of the data.
Another question is that the person concerned can't accept the contribution, especially the insurance undertakings are not bound by the contract.
So, the tigers are still on the side of the rock.
Global Marseille
Rescinding trade between the European Union and India
Just as the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, this issue is also in line with the agenda of the 11th anniversary of the 1990s on the other side of the global problem.
Today, it's going to be a French-Indian kiss where it's mainly about nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is an impressive democratic power which should be given greater prominence in international affairs, but it has not yet succeeded in bringing Member States together to support a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This question was not raised in Marseille yesterday, and it's about nine o'clock in the afternoon.
Mr Sarkozy, President of the European Union, and Mr Barroso, Vice-President of the Commission, and Mr Solana, took the position of Foreign Minister Manmohan Szing, who also agreed to double for five years, to increase trade to hundreds of billions of euros.
Given that the price increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not too ambitious.
In this respect, it is legally concluded that a bilateral civil aviation agreement with India may have been concluded, i.e. air traffic could also be generated in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU.
Sarkozy promised, they'd make the deal.
The aim is to balance that while the first number of trading partners in the EU is India, once again only the ninth place is the role of EU partners.
The boy was paying attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, was subsequently discussed in all its forms and accelerated the gathering of the ENSZ conference.
The end of the Doha trade cycle was also delayed, although the two of them have a large share in the faggot.
The EU has confirmed that in addition to its energy and climate programme, it would like to reduce the spread of harmful substances by at least one percentage by 2020.
India also agreed that the future climate conference should be linked to a global agreement and that the production of greenhouse gases should be measured by five per cent by 2050.
I would also like to stop the increase in food supplies, and I would like to support the integration of international understanding into the context of the financial crisis.
The Indian government today goes to the capital of France, where the two-part meeting is designed to cover business for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they are confident that Indian nuclear reactors are being entrusted with a total of EUR 1 billion.
According to the Agency's findings, the Agreement shall be 15 years old.
More than three hundred Italian books in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers represent themselves in a strong field in the Frankfurt International Book.
More than three hundred Italians will now be at the most possible international legal meeting, at the 60th Buchmesse.
The temporary International Book of Frankfurt is expected to produce 7000 exhibitors from 101 countries, 171,790 square feet, with more than 403,000 books being shown.
In the days of the Olasz Pavilon, the Italian government, Francesco Maria Giro, the Ministry of Cultural Java and Activities, represents the state centre of the state: Italy is the same, through the establishment of a single Italian bridge, with 264 square metres of exhibition area.
The event will be open to the information provided in the "Room Structure" of the Buchmesse 5.0 Pavilion, where the information, trends and interpretations about the location of the Italian library are sometimes opened.
According to the data, the Italian retail market continues to reduce the size of foreign contractors, particularly in the areas of adult and youth publications.
Found a billion-year-old, Steve Fossett's plane
The remains of the billionth Steve Fossett airport were found, which appeared on 3 September 2007.
A 3,000 - foot - high [3,000 m] peak was reached on the shores of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and Nevada, located in Mammoth Lakes.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, from Madera's sheriff, published all the remaining doubts: "After establishing the airport situation, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure it's about the machine that Steve Fossett said on the day of his flight" - published on a press release.
The sheriff further confirmed that there were no human remains in the airport or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-olds were declared dead in February.
The U.S. Security Authority (NTSB) announced that several hours after the red alert, a test committee was requested to identify the machine and to establish that it was actually about 8 kcab, which appeared on 3 September 2007, on the day Fosset launched a three-hour flight from the Nevat-Yerington.
Last night in California, he did not leave the border, and a couple of Fossett found some of his personal maids near the house of Mammoth Lakes.
Two, Fosset's certificate, which was issued by Illinois's Federal Aviation Agency, some cash and a wallet.
After a month of disappearance, they gave up their search.
The billions of pieces that he wrote in his history have been set up.
In 2002, for six attempts, he was first able to cross the ground by a plane: two weeks of private flight.
Three years later, he hit the ground without stopping.
A number of records are still on the Andok's surface flight, at a height of 15,445 metres, completed with a secondary pilot.
GLK, amusing advertising
An unusual, yet original and determined form world-wide hobbie, large surfaces, and flexible branches.
In a few words, Mercedes-Benz's most recent "computer's territory", which the German car driver tried to bring to the market a fresh estate.
Therefore, because of the different content of the tradition, the introduction campaign of SUV GLK from 17 October to the Mercedes-Benz shows will also be amazing and unusual.
The same advertising software that tries to introduce a new vehicle is still alive with an unknown media communication tool, including 3D posters that have not been used by a car in Italy.
The oil plate action, consisting of three stages, will take control of Milan's central buyer route, Corso Comót until November 15th.
This new type of media communication begins at the first stage with the indication of the vehicle’s location, which will be made available in the new SUV, with the help of special features shared around Corso Como, almost in actual sizes and in three dimensions.
The image viewer will feel like the car will get out of the plate.
Next, through innovative Elumina8 technology, the new GLK will be able to display all the details simultaneously so that it will then form a single picture.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new with this promotion into the advertising world of the stereotypes.
Is it possible to raise the interest of the buyers in the market? We'll see.
We'll show who the Italian football team is.
Trivenetous young people, they're probably going to get them out of their pockets.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls who are now suffering throughout Italy? The members of the "Ultras Italia" group who have been following the election for years and who, in truth, has not yet caused too much anxiety.
They've never met the enemy surgeons.
The team's been working on magic.
The chief organizers come from Trivento.
From Verona, Pado, Trieszt, and Udin.
These were joined by smaller groups from Campania and Puglia in Sofia (in fact only a few units).
Olasz had been set up in the ruins of the city of the sculptors: they were sent on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English surgeons.
In Bulgaria, they were looking at a real Nazi circus with the Levski prints.
The Italian Football Association has apologized 144 notes for the availability of Italian circuses. These were brands, so it was easier to check the circus team.
The Ministry of the Interior also verified all of them: there was no one who had been involved in the proceedings, no one who had been prevented from watching the stadium.
Four Italian surgeons who have a prism related to the rebirth were denied the mark and the release.
The Ministry of the Interior is currently waiting for reports from the Finnish police and then takes the necessary measures: those who were arrested or identified during the siege can be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
It is an international ban, not only on visiting all European stadiums, but also on Italian.
So our football fans can't even put their legs in a single football game.
Good luck.
But we also need to keep in mind the fact that they are found among the followers of the devil, that is, they are joined by almost a hundred others.
"The fire must therefore be extinguished, not allowed to save someone who behaves like this," said the Ministry of the Interior.
So it's better if we keep our eyes open, especially because it's close to the weekend election day in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a smaller seed that supports the Italian valleys.
Tomorrow the Supervised Service will be held, but the Sport Safety Assessment Commission, which may include one of the details of the Internal Security Service, will be appointed to the secret services of the school staff.
"Duce-Duce's scandal and war under the Italian sky? No crime in Bulgaria..."
This led to the idea that it was extremely unfortunate, Domenico Mazzilli, who had been appointed a few weeks to serve the Ministry of the Interior (the post of Francesco Tagliente, and before he was arrested by Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been head of Triesz, the city where one of the supporters of the Ultras Italiana group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli is right is not true in Bulgaria to live in Ducce, but from this, it was still shameful for 150-200 surgeons to behave.
I'm not a sociologist, he made it to the first person in charge of the service, but crimes must be committed in the country in which the claim is based.
So far, this group hasn't caused any concern, we need to examine exactly what happened, and see how it's going to be more important.
But let's talk a little about the worship of the Italian god: it's not a crime, but, if I say so freely, it can't be called goodness..."
