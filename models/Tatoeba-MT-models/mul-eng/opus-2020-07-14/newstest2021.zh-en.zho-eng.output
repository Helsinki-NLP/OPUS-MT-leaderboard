New timing assessment: the successful return of farmers to rural life-New War Network
The village wakes up. It's the key.
Where's the man?
A great return to rural farmers is an indispensable life force.
The New York Society, the business of the sea.
On 26 July, the New York Society received a telephony title: Renewing the forces of the village's best agricultural workers.
A 34-year-old man who was born in the village of Qingjuang in 2010 gave up his job and returned to his home business in Beijing.
After a few years of oppression, his annual income for family farm farming has now been more than millions of dollars, and he has been elected to the village's two "banks".
In recent years, a number of rural agricultural policies, such as rural reforestation, have been stimulated by national poverty, and a growing number of excellent farmers have chosen to return to their rural business and have been stimulated by spring water.
My West Population Province, the Province of Labour Exports, which led to the implementation of the "Good Farming Return Project" in 2019 alone, is a record of the remaining 8,000 people from the Ministry of Rural Support of the Returned Rural Workers, 610,000 from the Rural Development Force, and 20,000 from the Development Party, providing strong assurances to combat poverty and implement rural Revitalization strategies.
It's okay. It's important to look at the old town.
Since the opening of the reform, a large number of young people in my country have increased jobs outside the labour force, and some have created their own businesses through pressure.
However, objectively, it has led to the different levels of "airization" in rural areas, particularly rural-based organizations, the registration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the character of the party's members, the age-old age, the low-school education, the lack of strength and the lack of response to the problem.
If the rural community has been on its way to the city, it has been in the state of "lost blood" for a long time, reviving is an empty word.
Taking those who are capable and conscious of attracting rural workers who are willing to return to their homes, leading them back into their rural business as a leading figure, from the mid-optimal training of the party, the Ministry of Rural Affairs, to the basic task force, is a way of resolving the ill-treatment of rural parties and grassroots organizations.
Good farmers are coming back, and they're gonna keep them, and they're doing good.
In recent years, the Quartet has been building hands in the hands of farmers' working parties, based on strict standards of choice, to create a better approach to farmers, service guarantees, training skills, system mechanisms such as capacity-building, safety at work, life-threatening jobs, a real-time job in rural areas, and a sense of success in the business of officials.
This year is the year of the war against the hard-to-citizens of poverty, which is the key factor in the eradication of poverty and the return to rural areas.
The Governments of all levels of the country ' s parties would like to give high priority to the group of best-returned farmers, which, through integrated measures, would cause them to be left behind to fight, to fight, to carry on unhindered task forces, to provide strong organizational safeguards and support for rural poor health and development renewal.
As a result of the infection, this year's university graduate was a special session, and on the night of 11 July, the Bibili Summer graduation song will be played directly on the special line for the graduates, the grandparents, the trees, the Lions, and the Meongs, as well as the musicians, for the graduation to sing and bless.
The well-known lord SealWu has also brought together a "tree," which he has created in the form of a song based on the same famous composition, which is very popular among young people.
Because of their relationship with the vaccines, many graduates were not able to locate the site and teach the students how to feel, they transferred their symptoms online.
Data show that over 2.5 hours of this time, air quality is more than 35 million.
"Let's follow your heart, take the chance to stay, no more consequences, and sometimes there will be unexpected receipts."
Although it's a graduation party, many of the songs also make it impossible for the graduates to live.
"The whole scene really wants to cry, and every youth is so beautiful and sad, but it's worth the effort to walk away."
Beijing's natural ecosystems continue to thrive, attract the remaining 500 cities of wild animals.

The capital's natural ecosystems continue to thrive.
We've got 500 species in Beijing.
The report (New York Times) was informed by the Beijing Young Journalists from the Urban Forestry Agency that in recent years, the species and numbers of wildlife continue to increase with the natural environment in the capital.
At present, there has been an increase of up to 500 species of wild boars in Beijing, including wild animals at national level, such as wolves, lions, wolves, lions, and domestic animals.
Whether it is a forest in the middle of the city or a small hill between the walls, it is not only natural for its inhabitants but also attracts wild animals to " settle in the city " .
In the spring season, a biofuel was found in the natural protection zone in the mountains of the north of Mount San Francisco.
There's only one dog on the side of the mountain, and there's two dogs on the other side.
Back in the head, a wild beast's tusk, which does not live on its own, is making it look like a tree. As of the end of 2019, the Director of the Natural Protection Area of the Mountain Country Department, who lived in a total of over 2,200 square miles [2,200 sq km] of green sea, lived in the country's area of protection of animal welfare and protection of animal welfare at the national level, including 178 wild animals, including wild animals, including wolves, and nearly one third of all species of wild animals in the city.
"In the mountains, wild animals are the real 'Lord', and our staff are the only 'protection' of the human family."
In order to understand the situation of wildlife in the protected areas, there are more than 30 professional patrols daily, with 16 carefully designed road patrols, and one "crossing" every month, with almost a day's duration throughout the protection area.
" In the course of the inspection, there is no need to check the record of biodiversity and also to check the installation of the worker's poultry, to save damaged wild animals, to install the outer camera, etc. "
More than 200 red outer cameras have now been installed in the natural protection zone of the mountain country, which records the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
As biodiversity is growing in these years, more and more wild animals appear now in the mirror, dogs and dogs have become "permanent in the province", and the second level of national animal protection" has become increasingly high.
According to the Director-General of the Department for Plants and Forests Protection of Beijing City Forestry, Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 in 1994 and has continued to increase in the species and numbers of wild animals in Beijing in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in cities has become more and more closely associated with the growing growth in urban areas in recent years.
In particular, the construction of a new million forest-building plants, which began in 2018, has been proposed to re-establish the urban environment, to promote the ecological function of the soil, highlighting the notion of "near natural" nearby.
The plan seeks to achieve interaction with the surrounding green areas, allowing wild animals to be "dwelling friends", and the kind of trees that the animals like, and food crops.
I'm committed to helping computers and our communications around the world.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
In view of such a situation, a modern computer visualization bill can tell you, there's a woman, and there's a dog.
It can tell you, the woman's smiling.
It can even tell you, this dog is very cute.
I'm dealing with this question, thinking about how humans understand and interact with the world.
Those ideas, memories and stories in such a situation, may draw people's attention.
Interconnection of the connection.
Maybe you've seen a dog like that before, or you've been spending time running on such sands, and you've got more up the memory and thought of the past holiday, when you went to the beach, when you've run away with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is to help the computer understand what it is, what it is, what it is, what we believe and how we feel, so we have the capacity to develop computer technology, in a way that is complementary to our experience.
So, deep into this, I started working to help computers produce stories like humans, from image series.
So, one day, when I'm using a computer, I'm asking what it's going on about Australia.
He looked at the picture, saw a bum.
It doesn't know what the dome is, but the computer shows it thinks it looks like it's a very interesting animal.
And then I shared with the computer a series of images about the house burn.
The computer looked at a picture, and it said, "It's a wonderful vision!
It's getting me cold.
Computers see a terrible, life-changing event, and they think it's a positive thing.
I realize that the computer knows the difference between red and yellow, and that's something that's worth an active evaluation.
Part of the reason why I entered the computer is the most positive image.
That's because when people talk about their experiences, they focus on sharing positive images.
When was the last time you saw your picture at the funeral?
I realize that in the process of improving human intelligence, it is a task to return, data collection, in understanding the computer, to create huge gaps, gaps and gaps.
At the same time, I'm doing it for different kinds of prejudices.
The prejudice reflects a limited perspective, from a data collection -- it reflects the same human beings, such as the scene and the impression.
I remember the development of that technology, so that I could reach the place I was in that day -- the first color picture that was calibrated to a white woman's skin color, which means the color picture was different from the black face.
And the same prejudice, the dark point, continued to be brought into the 90th century.
The same point of darkness even today is still in the field of knowledge technology, how to recognize the faces of different people.
In today's research, I've come to think of the most advanced technology that is aimed at putting our minds at a data collection and a problem.
And doing so, we're creating more blind points and prejudices, which will be further increased when we use human intelligence.
Then I realized that we had to think deeply, and today we're developing creative technologies, and how will it be viewed after five to ten years?
In the interaction between humans and the environment, man's time to solve the problem, so slow growth.
Compared with human intelligence, it's developing at an incredible rate.
That means it's really important, and we need to think about this now -- about our own blinding point, and prejudices, and how these prejudices affect the technology we're creating now, and discuss today's technology, what it means for the future.
CEOs and scientists have been able to measure their ideas about the future.
Stephen Holing warned: "Human intelligence will kill humanity."
Iran's Mark warns it's an existing risk, and we're one of the biggest risks to civil society.
Bill Jones said, "I don't know why people don't worry about how they work."
But these views -- just part of the story.
That math, model, the basic component of these people's intelligence, is that we can both get and use.
We have an open source tool for the public to learn the learning machine, and at the same time make our contribution.
Besides, we can share our experience.
We can share it in the field of technology and it's our relationship, and how it's going to make us rich.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the future, which may be more useful in the technical field, or as time passes, more problems may arise.
If we all focus on open discussion of human wisdom, looking forward to the future, it will help create a normal dialogue and awareness about human intelligence, what can it become? and everything we need to do to achieve our best results.
We've seen and understood this in the technology we've been using today.
We use the smart phone, the digital assistant, and the autosmokers.
Are they bad?
Maybe sometimes it's.
Are they useful?
Yes, they are.
They're not exactly the same.
There you've seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to begin with what we now create and create.
We started Domingo's bone function, and it opened up the path of human intelligence.
In our time, it's been designed by people who work intelligence tomorrow.
In order to weaken in the real technology, to revive the past world,
When people find it difficult to communicate, technology helps them share their experiences.
Based on online video technology, it can be used on auto-pilots.
Science, based on the understanding of images, develops the technology to help people with disabilities, and helps them to have a better view of the world.
We've seen technology, too, how it leads to some problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth, such as our skin color or the appearance of our face, to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data on sex or race to determine whether we can obtain credit.
All we've seen now is that it's only human intelligence in the process of making a quick picture.
Because where we are now, it's a moment of change.
This means that what we do now will affect future developments, and extend to the future world.
If we want human wisdom to help us develop the ways of humanity, we will need to determine strategies and objectives, and open the way immediately.
What I want to see is the development direction for humans, cultural and environmental.
Science helps us to treat neurosynthesis or other patients with disabilities, to make life as challenging as everyone else.
The operation of technology will not take into account your characteristics or skin color.
I'm concerned today about tomorrow and the next decade's technology.
In many different ways, human intelligence can be manifested.
But in this case, it's not a destination without a car.
It's a car we can drive while we drive.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose whether or not to rotate.
We choose the future of the people who will work wisely.
There'll be a wide range of competitions.
It'll become a lot of different things.
Now depends on our understanding what we need to do to ensure that the results of human wisdom will be better for all mankind.
Thank you.

Black Land " kind of "from the modernization of agriculture" - New-Water Network
On 26 July, the New York Society, Harlin, on the theme of the "type" modernization of agriculture in black lands
In Zhesha, two pharmaceutical aircraft crossed a two-way high-level model field from the second operating station in the fifth management area of the friendly farm, forming two white lines, with a few big characters in the green field with a black-and-white "the first place" of the day.
The Chief of Staff of the Operations ordered that this aircraft be capable of handling more than 6,000 anti-aircrafts a day, with an efficiency of about 8 times as many as without a vehicle and hundreds of times as a human worker.
This farm, located in the friendly territory of the first state of Valentina, in the province of Vernon, has passed through the words of Madda, which is now known as "London", and the traditional Chinese farms and farms have been transformed on this black soil.
In addition to the aircraft, satellites are also used in the modernized agricultural production of friendly farms.
The order emphasized that, on the one hand, they used satellite-sensitivity technology to achieve repair facilities, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technologies could improve the standardized level of operation between plants.
During this year's hydrocarbon production, the farm has expanded the operation of satellite navigation to 30,000 tons from 3,000 tons last year.
This technology allows for greater growth in the soil, which can maximize the use of sun and rain resources, and can also save some 16 people working costs.
The farm was trying to educate and develop new technologies such as intelligence, which formed the largest agricultural machinery in our country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm farms is currently 4.9 million (i.e., 99.8 per cent of integrated machinery in the field.
Agricultural operations accomplished 100 per cent of GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent of dry land intensively, and 100 per cent of dry land trucks.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture is a path to modernization of agriculture."
I'm sorry.
The modernization of agriculture is key to scientific progress.
In recent years, a model of modernized agriculture "aeronautics" has been developed for the first time in the construction of scale growth, standardization of production and industrialization, leading to the modern agricultural industry.
In the area of friendly rural areas, there is a farm borough of 350,000 square meters on the ground.
This is the focus of a multi-year introduction of the Iron Curriculum, which has been used for more than 140 plants.
These plants and plants have witnessed the development of our country's modernization of agriculture.
A small village for everyone - a direct transfer of the New War network to the Afro-Aung-Aung-Aung-Aung-Aung-Air River.
On 26 July, the New York Society's electricity: Small people are moving directly towards the people of the Andean Rivers.
The New York Times, the Royal Army, the village of Kashmir.
On 25 July, more than 4:00 p.m., the bride-in-law dressed in a dormitory shoes, from the front door to the back of the house, and the wife came back to pick up things.
"I got the phone from the village department to move, and I'm still in the field. "
He turned over more than 60 yards of water, and he had a good look at it, and said, "I've been fighting drugs yesterday, and I've got no tools. "
"No one wants to be buried in the house, but the little village is for everyone."
In order to cope with the constant pressure of high water levels and the possible drop in rain, the city of Anzion is ready to launch a flood flood on 26 days at the foot of the wells of the island.
The river is in the bay of the West, and the lake is close to the lake.
There are thousands of villagers in the capital and three villages that need to be transferred.
As at 25 a.m., my country remains at 13.2 metres high and above 0.7 metres above water.
The kitchen in the kitchen of the house is clean and has a kitchen table with a kitchenette, a kitchen with milk and some dishes.
"You don't think you're going to move.
I mean, it's a room in the house, and some big things don't even want to be put in a good place.
"First collect valuable items, refrigerators, TV sets can be temporarily sent to high-ranking neighbors or neighbors. "
The queen of the village gave her the idea.
The Royal Assembly is responsible for the transfer of 13 villages, and one of its members is informed that each person's installation programme is confirmed.
The most recent location in the Far East is the village of Susu, a small village, about 2 km away.
In addition to the large ones, there are more than 1,000 petals and new food items in the home.
"The food's ready to pull to the neighbor's house, the house has been unable to move."
The couple had a conversation with a woman who was sitting on the floor under a new bed and raised her bed about half a mile away.
At 6:00 p.m., the baby began to drive to a neighbor's property using three wheels, and the week went on to collect it at home.
At 11:00 a.m., the couple looked back in front of the house once, pulled the wire, ready to install.
"I hope the water goes back soon."
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
On 26 July, at 9 a.m., the journalists saw that the site had prepared well before the Flood.
The Colin Small House Team has a new network of young people.
The campaign's youth hot-blooded campaign "Moving for young people" officially landed in South-West Lake on 11 July.
The movement's team's team's sequence and the movement's assistant little house cross-border, and the London and the Parking Point has a variety of styles, and the heavy nuclear tops of the "very big" powered device, making the program more "heavy enough."
At the top of the campaign's 11 youth-intensive race, while the outside audience was surprised, there was also concern at the "strong conflict" against "strongly hard-heartedness" on the competition technology.
Among them, the "force of conflict" came from the A-threatening Jovin, who was publicly challenged by a "best man" in the race before the game, and the outside condition of the band should go to the dance show and even release the phrase "do not blow the bell."
The youth and movement forces on the ground were all in a hurry.
And the "strong fight" is more like a fight against the gods, which is honored by the same powerful storm as the Great King.
And their identity also makes people think that health is a well-being actor, that the band is a decommissioning team, and that the three brave soldiers are the winners.
At the start of the game, the two young men pushed their fingers out of the box as quickly as they could, and on the long-standing resistance to the presence of the audience, they threw a knife at them.
In a tense situation, the following section is one of the youth movement leaders, also in a serious battle.
In a brief review, he was also very careful, encouraging a young person who lost his game and helping every failure in the recovery process.
In fact, it was an act of violence against young people who had no appreciation for the practicality of the Internet.
It is much more satisfying to learn about the daily training of young people in the campaign.
The same is the style of the Lyndan and the Garden of the Movement's leaders, one of the anti-Semitic " prophets " , and one of the "stupid " girls with smiles scattered around " .
In addition, Gikkong and Hingong, as an assistant to the movement, and around the movement youth, have produced a number of headlines.
Fires of the Southern Church of France: volunteers in the region recognize fires, equal and good words - in the new network
On 26 July, the media reported that on 18 July, a famous St. Peter and the Church of St. Paul were badly damaged in a fire accident and that the winds were completely destroyed.
On 26 days, the local Prosecutor of the South has announced that one of the parishioners in the parish had been prosecuted, a crime called " the destruction of the fire".
He's admitted to being a fire in the church.
It was reported that the 39-year-old local prosecutor, who came from Rwanda, admitted that three fires were on his own at night in the Grand Chamber.
The lawyer of the person said that the fireman had done this a long time ago.
By way of escape years ago, he entered France and was protected in this fire-fighting area and was detained in the church.
The prosecutor noted that he had recently tried to update his visas and was communicating with the Police Department in connection with the dialogue.
But the church still shows a lack of confidence that it is very good and smiling at the same time, but that it will destroy such a beloved church.
On the day of the fire on 18 July, the volunteer had already identified a problem that was not logical and had accepted police inquiry, but was subsequently released.
The picture is designed to help firemen in the area.
On 25 nights, a new evidence was received by professional engineers from the Central Police Laboratory in Paris, which was again reported.
This time, men recognized their own fires.
It was reported that if the guilty were to be set up to destroy the fire, the suspect would be liable to ten years in prison and to a fine of EUR 15 million.
It is reported that this great fire has caused serious damage to St. Pierre and the Church of St. Paul, and that the wheel inside the church has been completely burned and the color glass window behind it has been seriously damaged.
France's chief building builder, Brune, believes that the restoration of the church of the South would take at least three years.
Comprehensive information: United States unilateralism destroys relations between two countries. International opinion supports China's support for the anti-American-New War Network.
On 26 July, the New York Society was informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs of China on 24 July, the United States Embassy, the Central Party decided to withdraw the licence for the establishment and operation of the General Council of the United States of America and to suspend all operations and activities of the General Council.
The international consensus was that the unilateral measures taken by the United States caused serious disturbance to relations between the two countries of the United States and that China responded to the unreasonably challenge of the United States and that countermeasures were appropriate and necessary.
The Director of the China Research Centre of the Institute for International Research at the University of Chile said that the unilateral measures of the United States destroyed the bridge between the two peoples of the United States of America, leading to the crisis of relations between two major countries.
China has informed the United States that the closure of its headquarters is a violation of unilateral measures against the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Professor of the University of the Catholic University of Argentina, Patrisio Justo, Director of the AI Research Centre, considered that the above-mentioned decision was the right and necessary countermeasures against the United States prior to the challenge, not against the ordinary population of the United States.
The United States tried to shift the attention of the United States population to the purpose of suppressing China ' s failure to respond to the new vaccine situation.
Banban Suljono, President of the Institute for Innovation in Asia-Pacific, Indonesia, said that the United States had taken a challenging diplomatic approach and had serious problems with relations between the two countries in Central America.
China informed the United States that the United States ' s closure of its headquarters was normal countermeasures, consistent with diplomatic practices, reflecting China ' s firm stand for principle of maintaining its own interests, and its legitimate advantages.
Frances Semwinza, a time commentator in Tanzania, said that the above-mentioned decision was the right and necessary response to the challenge of the United States.
The Central American relationship needs to be restored to normal, and the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interference with China's domestic affairs.
The United States should look at how China has gained economic and political victory and how it has benefited both peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Josephford, Executive Director of the League of Arab-China Associations in the Sudan at Headquarters, said that China ' s forced countermeasures were justified and necessary to respond to the United States without a reasonable and necessary response, in accordance with the basic norms of international law and international relations and with diplomatic practices.
The former United States requested the closure of the China General Council in Houston to seriously violate the basic norms of international law and international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will withdraw the relevant decision and re-establish the necessary conditions for the regular return of relations between the two States.
Singapore's joint press release said that the biggest strategic goal of the United States was to surround China and to prevent China from continuing to rise.
The United States' step-by-step, although it is unwilling to see the continued deterioration of Central American relations, it is necessary to take countermeasures.

Newspapers from the DPRK were informed on 26 July of the fact that, recently, the U.S. customs office, the public sector, had launched a major private oil group, which had initially identified the group as a total of approximately 12 million tons of private oil since 2019, worth some 8 billion people's money, and had been ransomed for tax purposes.
The DPRK, together with the customs private sector, gradually clarified the working and organizational structure of the group.
On 8 July, the Marine Police, Customs and Public Security Department conducted a unified network operation in Galway, as well as in the Gulf and the coastal region, with 4 vessels suspected of being seized, 4700 tons of oil-containing oil, and a number of financial accounts were frozen.
It is understood that this joint operation has led eight vessels, two helicopters, divided into several action groups, engaged in sea-trafficking, combating all links, such as illegal operations on land, and 35 main suspects in all cases.
The case is being further resolved.
The relevant authorities of the GPA indicated that the future will continue to maintain high-pressure conditions, combating all kinds of criminal trafficking on the sea, and maintain good order in the region.
"Hanna" is in the United States, or it's in the middle of a river storm and a new network in the mountains.
On 26 July, the interconnected media reported that at 25 a.m. local time, Hana's landing in Texas, U.S.A., would bring a violent storm on the state, a flood, and perhaps a life-threatening mountain.
The National Wind Centre says that the "Hanna" is expected to cause a storm of floods, droughts in the south of the state and in the north-east regions of the region of the East, floods or floods, as well as life-threatening mountain explosions.
It is reported that the most serious impact of the "Hanna" wind is the southern region of Kompur-Christi in the region south of the Grand Canal, where the Rio Grande de Janeiro Mountains are likely to explode.
"Any wind is a big challenge."
There are 32 refugees in the state because of the hurricane crash.
More than 3 million cities in the city of Kokerscristi have been closed to the library and to the museum, and the population is in serious danger.
Abbott also said that as the state is experiencing a new vaccine situation, it can no longer cause more damage to the state.
It is reported that the water drop in the southern part of the state is expected to reach between 6 and 12 inches in the night of 26 days and that the waters of 3 to 5 pounds in the north of Texas and the coastal area of Louisiana are also expected to rise from 3 to 5 pounds in the sea.
As a result of factors such as global warming, the "Hanna" was formed early in the Atlantic Ocean.
In general, the first windfall in the Atlantic is usually due to mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from Europe a treaty to prevent violence against women
The Ministry of Justice of Poland indicated that the following week Poland would take steps to withdraw from Europe the Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The Minister of the Government of the right of Poland stated that the treaty required students to learn the subject of gender issues and to exercise their right to parents.
The Minister of Justice of Poland, Mr. Günbro, would say that his Ministry of Justice would propose to the Ministry of Labour and Family a request for a treaty to be withdrawn on Monday.
The Treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements that we consider to be harmful physical nature. "
The law governing Poland has a close relationship with its law and justice parties and its co-operation with the Roman Catholic Church to promote a protected social agenda.
President Douda of Poland has been one of the main topics of hatred for homosexual rights during the successful joint elections this month.
On Friday, thousands of Polish people (most of them women) were protesting against the withdrawal of the Convention in Warsaw and some other cities.
In a protest march in Warsaw, Lempat said, "The purpose of the withdrawal of the treaty is to legitimize domestic violence".
Some of the protestors are standing around and writing on "the law and justice parties are hell for women".
The law and justice parties have long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The Government of the former Central Government of Poland approved the Convention in 2015.
The Law and the Government of the Justice Party indicated that the treaty did not respect religion and required social policies to teach free movement in schools.
However, the party has not yet decided to withdraw from the Convention.

In addition to publishing the latest results of the examination, Bosonaro also posted photos of himself on the social media with a hand-held chlorofluorocarbon box.
Bosonaro has consistently claimed that this drug can effectively treat new vaccines and has demonstrated itself directly through social media.
According to the Brazilian media, Bosonaro announced that a motor vehicle would travel to the capital of Brazil on the day following the outbreak of the virus test and meet with a national parliamentarian.
Previously, Bosonaro had been away from the office of President.
In its joint press release on 7 November, Bosnia and Herzegovina announced that the results of its 6-day new chromium virus testing were sunny and two tests were carried out on 14 and 21 days, resulting in sunlight.
Nancy opens the green road for a young man against the Hong Kong.
On 26 July, the Government of the People's People ' s Republic of China's occupying Office of the People ' s Republic of New York clearly met with priority for individuals or their children who appeared in this anti-Suspending disaster mission, in compliance with the conditions and physical examinations, and political nuclear testing.
" After the registration of young people, we will give priority to the recruitment of all young people in the community, the Ministry of Armed Forces and the Luminosity. "
The Vice-Minister of the Forces of the Ninth-Chief Zone said that they had been affected by floods and that they had been concentrated on three days of youth testing.
In the Ninth-Chief district, youth competition is a 22-year-old graduate of the University, whose mother is community staff, the father is a retired soldier of some Department of the Air Force, and parents who have been competing for decades have been avoiding the value of the tunnel.
"These days, in the press, I want to be people like them, seeing people's soldiers guard their homes on the opposite side of Hong Kong. "
The competition said that he had a dream from his childhood, and this opposition strengthened his determination to join the army.
The Ninth City also launched the anti-School threat as a "active material", which they as a community called for to participate voluntarily in patrols, value-added missions, and the nature of the people's troops in the present situation, strengthening their confidence in the United States of America.
According to the 9th Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China, it is hoped that, in a way of priority, the youth will be more responsive to the promotion of participation in the mandate and a good social environment of military glory.
According to the overcrowded press report, Gryvori believed that Viet Nam had made a significant contribution to the development of the Asian Union for 25 years.
Viet Nam is not just an Austrian member, but rather an Asian train leader.
Grewori expressed the view that Viet Nam was contributing to the expansion of its image.
He stressed that "Asia should therefore be grateful to Viet Nam."
The analysis of the peace initiative submitted by Viet Nam was indicated in Gryvoli.
Viet Nam is willing to share experiences with Asian countries and to propose constructive peace-building measures on issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East Sea.
With regard to the cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia under the Asian framework, Grivori believed that Viet Nam provided support for the cooperation between Russia and Austria to help Russia benefit from that cooperation framework.
The European Economic Union, including Russia and Viet Nam, is able to enter the EU military market after signing the Trade Agreement with Viet Nam.
Grewor recommended that the European Economic Union and the Asian Free Trade Area be expanded at the highest level and create a platform for economic and security stability.
At the same time, Grewori believed that Russia was moving towards the right path and that it would achieve its objectives.
From now on, by the end of 2020, the northern province will have the necessary conditions, especially in the areas of infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to promote foreign flows, in particular with value chains and transfer of advanced technology.
In addition, the Province of North China would be able to submit to the Government's Prime Minister a statement on infrastructure construction and operational projects in the West Bank and to ratify the inclusion of two industrial-city-service areas in the overall planning of the development of the industrial areas of Viet Nam by 2020.
At the same time, the Province of North China is working to speed up the progress of projects, particularly in the West Bank, the construction of infrastructure projects in industrial areas such as the Two-Inland Hemisphere, and to create land funds for commercial investment.
In the year 2020, the Department of Trade in the Province of North China identified industrial areas, industrial group planning projects, to be integrated into provincial planning.
The Province of North Ouagadougou defines the integration of the development area with the security of the country, the protection of the environment, the integration of food security and the promotion of industrial balance; the availability of comprehensive electricity, water, transport and telecommunications infrastructure, and the integration of urban construction, trade services, worker housing and health, and other social infrastructures such as education.
In the industrial areas, the Province of North China has been calling for high-tech projects in the fields of electricity, electricity, telecommunications, skilled machinery, industrial support, and clean-up investment projects.
In the industrial field group, the province called for small-scale investment projects in the field of agriculture, especially agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, North-West Province will speed up its investment in the infrastructure of the Logistics Centre in the north-west of the city, and develop synergy with the industrial field groups, in order to optimise goods, currency flows and to reduce production costs, to improve the value of goods, to improve supply chains and to develop multi-modal transport, thus creating attractiveness for investors in the province.
The first launch of the Russian armed helicopter at the end of the year 52M - New Warehouse.
On 25 July, the New York Society of Moscow, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence plan, was the upgrade version of the Russian armed helicopter (hereinafter referred to as violent) Ka-52M — Ka-52M will complete the first refurbishment and launch of the plant in the first year of December, which will have a greater increase in the investigation, communication and arms performance.
According to a report from the Russian newspaper, Verhika-52M, whose development contract was signed by the Russian military and military units in April last year, the first 2 members of the upgrade was currently in receipt of the conversion of the remote helicopter facility of the Russian Aerospace Group ' s " Progress" from the East-Aerospace Group, which will end in October 2022.
According to Russian experts who were familiar with the above-mentioned promotional work, the "suppressive cut-off" "precise" — the official list of VV-52 in November 2011, which revealed some weaknesses in the use of the machine, which was then modified for "supplementary panel".
It was reported that, compared to the Ka-52, K-52M would take part of a new type of protective material that would not increase weight, which would be strengthened by its flight crews to meet the new equipment of the missile attack, thereby increasing the level of survival of the war field; increasing the frequency of deployment of more complex electronic equipment for electricity; increasing the electricity system could detect and detect a higher range of other targets; and the launch of new light multi-use missiles of major armed vehicles and ammunition-mixed manoeuvre workers, up to 20 kilometres; and their weapons and communications equipment would be used at the highest level with air-attached targets, thus making it easier and economic to maintain relevant maintenance.
In addition, Ka-52M will have advanced electronic control systems, weapons control systems and navigation equipment.
The Russian expert also stated that it was of concern that K-52M would be equipped with telecommunications equipment for contacting non-aircrafts and thus have access to information about the presence of non-aircraft transmissions, such as images of non-aircrafts on the screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the KA-52M pilots were directly able to control the unmanned aircraft they associated with, thus increasing the crew's control and control over the situation in the field of war.
According to the Russian media, the Deputy Minister for Defence of Russia, Kryworuch, said last December that the Ministry of Defence was planning to purchase over 110 armed helicopters to 52M before 2027.
The new legislation stipulates that the province of Kampania must have a public place in the room from the start of the day, with a maximum amount of EUR 1000 per person per day.
On 1 June, the local time was Rome, the capital of Italy.
It is reported that, in accordance with the latest anti-dumping legislation issued by the Government of the Great Lakes, the population of the Republic of Cameroon has to travel to all public transport facilities, as well as to enter shops, bars, supermarkets and exhibition halls, all of which must comply with the protection requirement.
A maximum amount of EUR 1000 per person in breach of that provision.
At the same time, the Law stipulates that all visitors from non-proprietary countries entering the Grand Chamber must be separated.
The Government of the Region will authorize health institutions to coordinate specific hotel arrangements and to distinguish between those who suffer from sunsickness.
The Act entered into force on 25 July.
In less than an hour, three customers entering the supermarket were punished.
Since this year, 175 billion cubic miles of water in the river in the middle of the river
Newspapers in New York City, on 26 July (King of the Journal of the Rivers) learned that since this year, the river basins have been refurbished with water and local reservoirs, which have continued to flow to the Danube River, the 28 rivers and the White Seas, such as the Remarkable Sea, and have completed 175.5 billion metres of the river’s ecological filling.
The province of the North Sea is rapidly gaining access to the time-limits for the mid-North North-West Channel project to increase the flow of water, and the ecological water supply has been implemented by drawing water to the Danube, the Salt Sea, and the Danube River.
At the same time, the use of 9 large medium basins, such as East Atlantic, and the whitefin tuna, has been implemented to the Sun, such as the Sun River, and the pooling of water is more than 90 square miles [90 sq km].
In order to improve the quality of water supply, the Office of river basins actively organises river flow screenings, improves the consolidation and river cleanup, streamlines practicalization measures and enhances monitoring care.
By monitoring and focusing visits and timely solutions to all kinds of problems, the river water supply has been ensured in order to ensure the safety of river basins.
According to the relevant authority of the river basin, the implementation of the river basin eco-pollution has effectively restored the ecological environment of the river river basin, promoted the recovery and recovery of coastal waters, and greatly improved the environment of the coastal population and the economic development of the river, with significant importance for the achievement of the river management objectives of the "water, coastal, river basin and forest".
You should all know what I'm talking about.
I believe that inequality can lead to social division and corruption before the Great Revolution of France.
In contrast, we can now find evidence that we can identify the effects of inequality by comparison with society, by different degrees of equality, by understanding the effects of inequality.
I'll show you some data and explain why those data are really connected.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
(Laughter) I'd like to start my talk with one of them.
This picture shows our average life relative to the total income of the national population -- the latter measured the average level of wealth of the country.
You can see those countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, their wealth is Israel, Greece, Portugal, twice those on the left.
But it didn't affect the average life of their citizens.
No signs of interconnection.
But if we get to know the insides of society, there's a huge difference in their health situation in the whole society.
This picture shows, it's still the average life.
These are the little towns of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a big difference between the poor and the others.
Even those who were just under the roof, their health was worse than those who were on the roof.
So income in our society means a lot, but it doesn't make any difference in the relationship.
That contradiction is, in our society, what we see as relative income or social status, the identity -- that's the relationship between us and that between people and people.
If you have that idea, you should immediately think: What happens if the Conference expands? What if it reduces the gap? How will it expand or reduce the income gap?
That's what I'm gonna tell you right away.
I didn't use any guesses.
My data came from the United Nations — as well as from the World Bank — as from the income gap between these rich and democratic countries in the developed market.
The way we use it, it's easy to understand, and you can download, is 20 percent before each country's income gap and 20% later.
You can see that all the countries on the left are equal – Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden – their former 20% wealth is approximately 3.5 to 4 times behind 20%.
But on the other side of the inequality -- Britain, Portugal, the United States, Singapore -- income gap is going to rise once more.
According to this comparison, the level of inequality in our country (United Kingdom) is twice the number of other successful democratic markets.
And then I'll show you what this has to do with our society.
We've collected data on issues arising from internal differences in society, such as those at the most basic levels of society, more universal.
Internationally comparable data include average life, children's mathematics and language performance, infant mortality rate, suicide rate, prison population percentage, early pregnancy rate, inter-faith rate, pregnancy, mental disease — all of which are consistent with the standard classification of drugs and alcohol — and social mobility.
We're going to put all of this into one set.
They're all under control.
A country's share of these factors is averaged.
You can see, these numbers are relative to the inequality I've just shown, and I'm going to repeat these data.
The more inequality countries appear on various social issues, the worse.
The connection is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared to the figures of income from people and the total income of citizens, you'll find nothing you can find, and you're not relevant anymore.
We have some concern that people might think that we are choosing a specific issue to accept our theory and then to produce evidence for people, so we also published a paper on the United Nations Children's Welfare Index in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different parts, from other people's conclusions.
It includes whether children can communicate with their parents, whether there are books, how many immunization rates at home, and whether there is corruption in school.
Everyone's in.
This is the relationship between the index and the same level of inequality.
In an increasingly unequal society, children's performance is worse.
The relationship and its significance.
But once again, if you see it as a child's benefit and a relationship with people's income, you won't get anything.
All the data I'm showing you right now is the same thing.
The average welfare of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poor countries, but not so for rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position relative to others now seems very important.
I'm going to show you a few sections of our indexes below.
This is an indicator of mutual trust.
It means that most people agree.
This is from the World Value Survey.
You can see, on the other hand, there are about 15 percent of people who feel they can trust others.
But in a more balanced society, this percentage has risen to 60 per cent or 65 per cent.
If the participation of community activities or the assessment of social capital is re-examined, there is a very similar link between inequality.
I mean, we've resumed this job twice.
First of all, these rich developing countries, and then we've changed the test target, and we've repeated this test to 50 states in the United States -- the same question: are those more unequal states doing worse in all these assessments?
This is the relationship between the federal government and the inequality that has developed in a general social investigation.
A very similar distribution point is distributed on a similar level of confidence.
The same thing is still going on.
Basically, we have found that almost all the factors related to mutual trust in international investigations are also reflected in the 50 states where we are separately investigated.
That's not a coincidence.
It's a mental illness.
The World Health Organization uses the same diagnostic approach to collect data that enables us to compare the mental disease rate of each society.
This is the proportion of people with mental illness who have an arbitrary condition last year.
It's ranging from 8 per cent to 24 per cent -- this shows that the ratio of mental illness in the whole society is 3 times that of another society.
Similarly, these have a close relationship with inequality.
This picture is a crime rate.
Red points to the States of the United States, blue triangles to the provinces of Canada.
But look at how many of them are different.
Murder rates range from 15 million to 150 million.
This is the ratio of prison inmates.
This is a 10-fold gap, and the number of digits will increase this gap.
But the number of prisoners has changed from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But more is severe trials, or more severe trials.
The more society is unfair, the more inclined it is to keep the death penalty.
This picture is a high school situation for children.
Similarly, the gap is huge.
If we discuss the choice of society alone, we will find this gap very serious.
This picture is social mobility.
Actually, it's based on income-based mobility.
Basically, what it asks is whether the rich father has a rich child, the poor father has a poor child, or there is no relationship between these two?
On the other hand, Dad's income is more important than his income -- for example, England, the United States.
And in northern Europe, Dad's income is not that important.
There's more social movements there.
As we have often said -- I know there's a lot of Americans here -- if the Americans want to achieve their "American dream," they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause)
I can show you some other questions.
Those issues are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.
But there are poor social dimensions, which appear to be worse in inequality countries -- not just a little bad, but almost 2 times 10 times.
Think of the cost, the cost of human resources.
I'd like to go back to this picture that I've shown before.
First of all, through a duplicate chart, we found that the worst countries, whatever, seem to be the more unequal countries, but those that seem good, all of them are North Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between universal social confusion and inequality.
Not just one thing happened, but almost everything.
The other important thing I'd like to point out in this picture is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they're showing that they're very different countries in all respects.
The status of women, the degree of strict respect for small families, in rich developed countries, is in two extremes.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a huge difference in income, but it has tax revenues, national welfare, generous relief, etc. to reduce the gap.
Japan is very different.
Firstly, the wage gap is smaller than before Japan's tax.
It's less taxable.
It's a little less of a favor.
And in a study of the United States, we found a clear comparison.
Some states are good by redistribution, and some other states are good because there's a small gap in income before tax.
So we have to conclude that how to achieve greater equality is not important, and it's important to achieve this equality.
I'm not talking about full equality, but I'm saying that there's actually a situation in rich developed market democracies.
With regard to this picture, another thing of concern is not only the poor but also the effect of inequality.
John Dunn seems to have some sense: "No one is an island. "
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of each social class to the level of equality or multiple or less different countries.
It's just an example.
This picture is the infant mortality rate.
According to the British general socio-economic classification record, some Swedishs were highly treated with kindness for the death of a lot of babies.
It's a class of non-conformity based on father's position, so single mother becomes a group of data.
But we're looking at what's called the "social low-level" class, that's work without technology.
In the middle, it's a technical manual job, a high non-manufacturer job, a high level of professional work, a doctor, a lawyer, a manager of a large company.
This shows Sweden doing better than the United Kingdom, doing better in every social class.
The biggest difference is the bottom level of society.
But even on the top, living in a more balanced society has some advantages.
We showed the 5 different data, including the educational results of the United States and the international, as well as the health situation.
It seems generally – the most obvious differences between society and society at the social level, but there are also some advantages at the social level.
I should explain what's going on.
I believe that I am demonstrating and discussing the impact of inequality on social thinking.
More is concerned about superior feelings and humility, being valued and invisible, being respected and humiliated.
Of course, the feelings caused by the competition for identity have led to social consumerism.
But it also contributed to the uncertainty of the status.
We're more concerned about how others judge and look at us, whether we seem to be attractive, smart, or so.
Social values have increased the fear of these social values.
Interestingly, similar work has been done in the field of social psychology: some have found 208 different studies; in the study volunteers were invited to a mental testing centre and then tested their pressure hormones and their response when they performed their pressure tasks.
In this observation, scientists are interested in what kind of pressure is best able to raise the skin, the most important level of stress hormone.
As a result, those tasks that include social evaluation threats — threats to self-esteem and social status — can be effectively evaluated by others in these missions.
These pressures have a very special effect on theology of stress.
We have already accepted criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, and some find it very appealing.
But I should still tell you that when people criticize our sample data, we've never done that.
We have an unconditional provision that if our data sources contain data from the observed countries, we will include them in the analysis.
Our data source decides whether the data is effective, not us.
Otherwise, there will be a difference.
What about other countries?
In the periodic journals of the academic review, 200 studies were related to health and income equality.
It's not limited to these countries here, hiding a simple proof.
The same country, the same inequality measurement method, the question one by one.
Why don't we control other factors?
I've shown everyone the national income that has not had any impact.
Of course, others have applied more complex methods in the literature to exclude poverty, education, such as in the trials.
What about the relationship?
The relevance itself cannot prove the link of the factors.
We've spent enough time.
True, people have a good understanding of the consequences of these results.
The greatest change in our understanding of the long-term drive factors of health in developing countries is the long-term pressure from society to immunization and the impact of the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, violence in less unequal countries has become more and more common because people don't feel very sensitive about themselves.
I mean, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after tax and before tax.
We should limit income, restrict the culture of prize income on top.
I think we have to do everything we can to get our leaders responsible for the staff.
I finally want to conclude that we can increase our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
If we do that, we'll find that we'll suddenly solve the social and mental health problems of the whole society, that's really great.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the past two weeks, Spain has seen thousands of new cases.
On Saturday (25 July), the British Government decided to temporarily remove Spain from the security travel list from the list and to leave Spain for 14 days from the United Kingdom.
This decision, which was being heard by British tourists on Spanish holidays, expressed surprise and concern and even anger, as news such as it was unmanaged.
It was reported that the British Minister for Transport (Grant Shapps) is currently in Spain.
Prior to the publication of separate measures in Britain, Norway has also announced that persons returning from Spain to Norway would be separated for 10 days.
France and Belgium recommended that their inhabitants give up their plans to leave Barcelona and the surrounding region.
Seafarers in these areas are sick, people are unable to maintain social distance between people, and police are required to take measures to reduce the number of seafarers.
The tourism industry is an important pillar industry in Spain.
Spain: It's safe here
With regard to the decision taken by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated that the country was subject to control.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Arancha Gonzalez Laya, emphasized to the media: " Spain is safe, not only for Spanish people, but also for tourists. "
The Government of Spain will try to persuade the Government of England to exclude the Balearic Islands (Balearic Islands) and the Canary Islands (Canary Islands) from the separation measures.
The reason is that these two tourist destinations are far lower than the British territory.
In order to prevent the spread of vaccines, the ban has also been reintroduced in the California area of Spain.
The tourism industry is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most frequent holiday resorts in Britain.
This decision of the United Kingdom is expected to have a significant impact on Spain's tourism industry.

Spring Day: Beijing's permanent high temperature and launch rain patterns - New-Water Network
The New York Society's first day of the year was on July 26th (New York Times) on July 26th.
The 26-day winds of the Great Wind blew up the weather and spread to the high temperature in Beijing, and a new wave of rain will continue for days.
The Beijing metro level was announced at 11:00 p.m. on 26 days that Beijing had a dispersive rain (with low-power), a maximum temperature of only 27 °C; a low to mid-night rain (with low-mean power) and a minimum temperature of 23 °C.

The sun is the most warm, warm, warm day of the year, the most warm day of the year, the hottest day of China's people.
When they entered, the house was filled with mud.
According to current forecasts, the future will be three days.
The weather sector suggested that the public be able to minimize mountain games and prevent natural disasters.
It is understood that this year's "meaning" has 20 days, from 26 July to 14 August.

Eating can be selected in green, with a warm aroma, a healthy meal, and a tasteful meal, such as vegetables, can help promote appetite and cooling.
The engine may fire the FAA's command to search for 2000 bombers -- New Warehouse.
The United States Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) issued an emergency-adjustment order on 24 days to request an emergency inspection of approximately 2000 bombers, 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft registered in the United States, which could result in the explosion of the air-conditioning of the above-mentioned aircraft.
The Federal Aviation Agency reported that up to this day, 4 737NG and 737 Classic air traffic types had been reported on in the aircraft and that the purpose of the inspection was to continue to be suspended for 7 days and more than 11 times after the re-entry of flights.
The Federal Aviation Agency warned that the 5th level of the two engines of the aircraft would be reduced if they were damaged, that the car might be opening, resulting in the total loss of force of the aircraft and could not be relaunched.
This air regulatory body ordered that, once it was found to be contaminated, air carriers must replace this key component before the client is re-entered.
In response later that day, the Bosco company responded that the new vaccine situation had led to a decrease in demand, and many clients were archived or less used, " to prevent the return of the vaccine more easily from being contaminated " .
At the same time, it has been suggested that the air carrier inspectors should check the client's orders, and that if the problem is identified, it will provide inspection and replacement assistance in the area of return.
The U.S. reported that the U.S. main air carrier flag normally flew several times during a day, but after the outbreak of the new tsunami, large air carriers stopped; and with the need for a slow increase in the demand for passengers, some of them re-entered into operations.
The Federal Aviation Agency did not publish details of the four air traffic stop reports.
The Alaskan Air Force revealed an incident that occurred 24 days later.
In his statement, the air carrier said that a client flying from Westyatu, Washington, U.S.A., on July 15 was suddenly set off on the road to Ossain, Texas, and finally landed at the Osseni airport.
The Alaskan airline said that the engine had changed its engine and had been tested according to the Federal Aviation Authority's instructions.
The United States Air Force, the United States Air Force, and the South Air Force 24 respectively, said that there was no engine fire on the flag landing.
The United States Air Corps flag will be subject to inspection, and 28 air carriers will be subject to inspection by the United States Air Corps.
DAMI said it would check the flag on 20 passengers, but it did not indicate whether the engine fires had occurred.
A number of media reports that the Federal Aviation Agency's emergency navigation orders were another attack on Bosom.
On October 2018 and March 2019, 346 people were killed by each of the bomb 737 MAX clients in Indonesia and Ethiopia, respectively.
This series of clients subsequently stopped global, and this year, this year's legacy, re-produced in May.
In June, Steve Dixon, Director of the Federal Aviation Agency, admitted that the Federal Aviation Agency had been “misleading” on the control of Bosom.
"Study on the top of the line, teacher, next week on the top of the line.
There's a new integrated line.
An interactive knowledge-sharing program "School! teacher well" will be released on 20 July in South-West Lake.
Understandably, the program will create a new full-year-old classroom, and a number of highly skilled teachers will take the initiative to challenge interesting knowledge outputs.
In contrast with the strong impressions of the old teachers in the hearts of the people, "Studies on the top of the line! "The teacher is a valuable and skilled representative of knowledge.
They are both examples of youth knowledge from all sciences, or a group of packs, teaching the master's whole power "hands".
In the program, these excellent young people of knowledge will challenge the school of knowledge that is fun.
They need to take the audience to the side of the most interesting field of education by means of meaningful knowledge output.
There will be hundreds of changes in the location of the "Question Mission" in the age group, which will increase the difficulty of teaching the "Secrets of Knowledge" and increase the scope of the program.
It was discovered that this "knowledge Sharing Officer" included secondary professors of physics at the University of People of China, Liouu, who studied the teaching of the names of Snowwood and the excellent young teachers who had a ten-year-old experience, who would demonstrate to the audience in an unexpected manner the "hard nuclear" knowledge of various sciences.
In addition, the program invited the professor of economics to open a public school for "all young people".
Director of the Hong Kong Government Division: The situation is serious, full-time vaccine-in-new.
On 26 July, the Director of the Hong Kong Government Division stated that the situation in Hong Kong is still serious, and that if the vaccine conditions deteriorate, the Government of Hong Kong will take more stringent control measures, further restrictions on the operation of the premises and reducing public spaces.
However, the Government of the region of the present stage does not intend to impose "the residence order" or "the ban" on citizens outside the city.
On the day of the construction, a blog entitled "The Hard Situation and the Full Resistance" was published.
He said that this vaccine situation was the most serious in half a year, and it would be very critical in the future two weeks to prevent the spread of HIV in the community.
In addition to taking the necessary measures by the Government of the Special Area, self-determination and co-operation of citizens are also important.
He called for citizens to stay at home as much as possible and to reduce social contact and outsourcing.
Citizens should cooperate with the mandatory measures to protect themselves and others, focusing on personal and environmental health and work-cleaning, and should be more on the suspension of unnecessary friendly gatherings or meals and reduce to the city.
He said that the central attention had been paid to the change in the situation in Hong Kong and to support the efforts of the Government in the area to prevent vaccines and to respond actively to the latest request of the Administrator to assist in the expansion of the inspection capacity and the transformation of the Asian International Hospital in the work of a similar "road hospital".
It was suggested that the Government of the region had carried out a comprehensive examination of the free virus for specific high-risk groups, namely the Anno-houses, the disabled buildings and the nursing staff, the restaurant staff, the rental of the car driver and the business manager, involving more than 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about the infection of the Anan Hospital, and the Government of the Region had organized a specific temporary vaccination centre for its friends.
He said that the Government of the region was in the vicinity of the Oval Ouagadougou vaccination centre in New Zealand, which was expected to provide additional 700 separation rooms by the end of September.
The Administrator also announced on 19 December that the Government of the Region would be increasingly involved in the construction of the 2000 separation room at the Center of the Ouija board and that it would be expected to fall before the end of this year.
In addition, the separation centre has been in use by 800, which is expected to provide a total of 3500 separation rooms at the end of the year.
There are currently four separation centres operating in Hong Kong, providing approximately 2600 separate rooms.
In addition, on 24 days, the Government of the Region reopened the fishing park park in Hong Kong as a community separation facility for the recovery of patients with independent autonomy under 50 years of age.
A regular party history, a new "food" in China's history.

In the near future, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled in his visit to the four-pillar Memorial: " The Ministry of Leaders of China's Communist Party History, New China's History, would be very good to learn about China's history. "
The history of the party, the new Chinese history, is an integral part of the Ministry of Defence, and takes note of the necessary adjustments to the mission, from the heart to the heart of the country, and from the heart to the heart of the new era.
The history of a botanical party, a new Chinese history, recorded by the Chinese Communist Party's hard struggle and light-saving history since its birth, demonstrated the belief and loyalty of the Communists in the use of life and blood, as well as in the long-standing initial and mission.
History is the best textbook, and for the Department of Party Affairs, the new Chinese history is the most famous chapter in this school book.
Each party member's department will continue to strengthen its historical knowledge, to move to the future history of Savi, to establish a new agenda, to take the "responsibility" of the era, and to lead the long way of moderns.
In the heart of history, in the history of the party, in the new Chinese history, the initial mission was to be maintained.
The reopening history of the party, the new Chinese history, is filled with the constant initial mission of the Chinese Communist Party and the strong faith of the rock-like party, which shows that the Communist party has always been with the people.
Closely far from understanding the history of the Party, important events in the new Chinese history, important meetings, important people, not only direct frustrations, meditations, but much more deeply reading in the mind and understanding of the original beliefs, and knowing the proportions of the mission.
In the case of the Department of Defence, the desire to continue to give priority to the mission, always to this color, is to find our starting point in the history of the Party, the initial support point in the new Chinese history, to maintain a clear consciousness and firm position, to attract the strength of the nation's courageous pressure, and to ensure that the revolution is spread by blood and life-threatening Red Mountains.
In the history of the student parties, in the new Chinese history, it's a highly respected spirit.
Since the formation of the Chinese Communist Party, the spirit of the Red Sea, the spirit of the Red Sea, the spirit of the deep, the spirit of peace, the spirit of war, the spirit of Cyprus, the spirit of "two billion" and a series of great spirit, such as the spirit of space.
The great spirit in these historys has provided our parties with a strong spiritual incentive to overcome all the dangers ahead of the road, to fight, to escape, and to capture precious spiritual riches.
The process of learning the history of China is a process that is so intense and self-conceivable for these minds and self-conceivable, that it is a reflection of the noble spirit of the revolution, that it preserves the spiritual paradise of the Communists, that it can move forward to the great event, achieve a solid spiritual foundation, and that it can be inherited and revived and spread new eras of light.
Reading the history of self-esteem, learning the history of the party, and continuing in the new Chinese history.
In the case of the Department of Defence, there is no record of history that could bring more serious warnings than the history of the party, and the new Chinese history would be exposed and denied.
In the history of the party, in the new Chinese history, the faith of the old revolutionists has never been lost, and the belief in the existence of a great deal of things to achieve a certain goal-winning struggle, and the belief of some people has led to profound lessons about the revolution, and the proclamation and warning of our determination and will never cease, and the struggle has always been so intense, and there has always been a strong struggle, and there has always been civility, and the law has been reformed.
In order to be truly a strong believer, a very optimistic Communist faith, a faithful practiceer, need to think of "poison," a serious "skinned" infection, the history of the party, and the new Chinese history should be a self-examination of every party member, warning me of my own base.
In the history of the Party of Learning, it is the era of courageous challenges in the new Chinese history.
The Deputy Secretary-General had noted: "The history of the learning parties, the history of the country, is the persistence and development of special socialism in China, the continuation of the parties and the necessary reforms towards progress. "
Looking back to history, asking for the first time, for the glory to continue, to go to the future.
Each party member should follow the history of the learning party, the new Chinese history as a lifelong pursuit, the continuing life-cycle of the learning process, the courageous mission of history at their respective workplaces, and the responsibility and active initiative as a matter of responsibility.
Continuing to look at and direct the progress of an old revolutionist and to keep the political character of the Communist party alive, to continue to fight only in the face of war, and to develop a spirit of fighting that is more dangerous and more dangerous than before, and in the process of the great rebirth of the Chinese people, the writing is one of their own deceptions.
The new network in "Singing-Singing" is looking for a dream of the jungle.
(China's story of poverty reduction)
On July 26th, the New World Bank, "Ninky River Rissa, in the middle of New York City. "
It is encouraging that countless writers have produced a beautiful landscape of snowflakes, and now it has a "Ethical Priorities", a green development concept, and a "Gehenna dream".
The "Water Dream" of the river.
"The Sun Funginsha, the Sun River, 397 miles [397 km] away, is a "Mother River".
But with industrialization, urbanization rapidly progressed, the river lakes developed the use and management of the protection imbalances, over-exploitation, over-sea pollution, pollution of the lakes, pollution of the water areas, resulting in water blacks, water surpluses, environmental degradation and ecological degradation.
Now, Ninsha is promoting a wide variety of water ecosystems, and it's also trying to clear the river of the Gulf.
The water's going down from its head.
In the Ninsha Bank, localized "significant-restraining-grassing" means the centralization of the entire industrial area of pollution water, the total emissions from the urban water treatment plant to the standard level A, the destruction of the urban areas of black soils, and the successful declaration of the Third Group of China's Blackwater Sample cities.
In addition, Ninsha has fully implemented river management in 2017 and is now fully covered by the river basin management system at the fifth level of the village village of the district, and the river basin has become a regular part of the river.
The 64-year-old nurse lived in a village on the river Juju, where he saw the change in the river: "The former one smells, and there's no smell after it is healed."
It turns out that the environment has improved, and his life is much happier, and now he and his family are on their way to the river Juju.
Sang-san's "dark dream"
The beautiful sight of the birds, the green trees, the bays, and the water, under the cover of the "Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao's" pool in the Nin-Sawan River has become reality.
The GHG River has created river basins, lake basins, river basins, evaporation sites, and a wide variety of droughts, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water, as well as in becoming an international-scale migration route for birds.
Since 2009, the Ninsha-related sector has invested approximately 345 billion people in the project for the protection of landfills, currently covering 1,9 million square miles of land, 78.5 per cent of natural lakes, nearly 200 square miles of dry land, one in 5 national forest parks, 6 in self-government areas, 8 in urban parks.
The Deputy Director of the Banking Centre for the Protection of Forests told reporters that drought protection has increased biodiversity and is particularly evident in the species of birds, "the remnant is a endangered species, with only 20,000 species in the world and more than 2,000 in the world. "
At the same time, in accordance with the law, Ninsha has established a red line between the area of 500 metres between the two coastal banks of the Gulf River and provides that no unit and individual must develop and operate activities within the context of protection.
The Deputy Director of the Centre for Water Services in the Banking of the Sea, through the management of pollution, integrated river lake ecosystems and the final drought, has now reached 100 per cent of the water quality, "and now the water has become clear and the fish has grown and blossomed."
The "Water Dream" of Pughy's birth.
The city of Ninsha Bank has been called a "birth": the only city in the city of Qingju.
Since 2010, the water shortages in the summer of the summer began to confront persistent droughts, and in recent decades the "difficulty of water" has become a painful experience for many people living in high-level buildings, but in large-scale water sources, water shortages have become a problem in the urban areas, and water shortages have become a problem in the urban areas.
The improvement in the quality of rainwater is beneficial, and the use of clean drinking water is a good way to solve the problem of drinking water for the local population.
The Vice-President of the Banking Office of Water Affairs made it clear that, in order to improve the production of water for the inhabitants of the Banking City, in order to improve the production of water, Ninsha launched a water project on the western side of the City of Banking to replace the source of the land.
"On 29 December 2019, the water engineering works officially penetrated the triangular areas of the Banking City, in 2020, and the inhabitants of the province of China also drank of the rainwater. "
Dinging said that the Banking Water Sector would take into account the reform of regional rural drinking water and urban water integration, " Next, we will integrate rural water supply points into the western line for water engineering, and expect the urban integration of the region to be essentially achieved at the end of this year " .

For the first time in the United States, a counter-subsidy investigation was conducted against China with a "low rate of population exchange"
The United States Department of Commerce recently announced that it had decided to initiate anti-dumping subsidies investigations on products originating in China and to launch an investigation on the project " low-estimated population exchange rate".
The Ministry of Commerce of China noted that this was the first project in the United States of America ' s case investigation of the so-called "low-value of the population exchange rate" that the Central Party strongly opposed.
In this regard, the Ministry of Commerce of China issued a press release on Friday, 23 nights, specifically on the basis of market demand, referring to the adjustment of a single currency, the management of the flow rate system and the decisive role of the market in the formation of exchange rates.
The press release emphasized that, in general, the population exchange rate was at a reasonable level and was not underestimated.
Since 2005, more than 17 per cent of the population's money has been spent on the United States dollar.

The Ministry of Commerce noted that exchange rate issues exceeded the mandate of members to conduct counter-subsidy investigations in accordance with the World Trade Organization rules.
In February this year, the United States of America revised its rules of procedure to investigate counter-subsidy investigations on foreign exchange rates, which have been suspected of violating WTO WTO rules and which have been rejected in many respects.
The press statement states that even in accordance with the United States legislation, the complainant ' s claim content is a serious mistake, without financial funding, and that the grant of interest and the granting of the grant of the benefit and the allocation of the grant would be necessary.
China urged the United States to comply with the existing international rules and to cease the anti-subsidy investigation of so-called " low-value population exchange rates".
The tension between the United States and the United States had increased impact on the situation, and the border had a large share of US$ 22-day exchange rate, with a double down to $1 per capita rate of $7.0.
This is whether the US Ministry of Commerce intends to increase the value of the people's currency.
The people's currency for the United States dollar was at a rate of 7.0 over the next 23 days, which was collected at 6.9961.
The average price for the exchange rate of United States dollars for the official controlled population is 17 basic points below 24 days, reported 6.9938.

Banking: Division of approaches to support young children's stabilization team Vou-Newwa
On 26 July, the New World Bank (New York City Journalist Afmee) was affected by the epidemic, which had not yet been restored, particularly by the increase in the financial pressure of the population on the youth heritage, which had a certain impact on the stability of the youth education team and on the future development.
In this regard, the Bank has taken a number of measures, such as the provision of grants for the provision of childcare funds to the general public, the provision of a stable grant to non-governmental children, and the release of young children ' s housing, in support of these small children ' s stabilization teams.
In accordance with the relevant policies of the Banking City, for the time being in the vaccination situation, the organisation of small and medium-sized children (including small-sized children in the urban districts) organized a minimum wage rate of three districts to teach staff at least 1660 basic living costs per month, and the municipal finances will provide a per-year basis of 1000 per-year funding for teachers' and social insurance costs.
In the same case, for each month for the same staff member, non-privileged persons with a basic living cost of 1660, the Banking City will arrange for six-month grant funding as a stable grant for young children ' s teachers, in accordance with the funding criteria for each year's 500-year-olds.
At the same time, the Bank will reduce the rent of three-month housing during the control of the vaccine, and encourage other types of lease owners, such as the developers, to reduce the social responsibility for the rental of the child ' s premises and to release the child ' s premises for more than three months and to relieve the relevant taxes under the policy provisions.

The Department is expected to have an impact on the flow of water up to 60,000 metres per second after 28 days, and it is expected that the flow of water into the tank may reach 60,000 meters per second, the average flow of water in the river basin and the flow of water in the lakes will be restored and maintained by approximately 0.20 metres; the total flow of water in the river will continue to decrease; and the river basin will continue to slow down; and the river basins, such as the river of the Dead Sea, will continue to run out of the river.
It is quite reasonable to suggest that the river basins will increase the flow of water to the extent that they will be able to reduce the water flow of the Danube River as soon as possible and prepare for war and possible floods.
It is necessary to make a full effort to respond fully to the flood of rainwater.
He said that the region of the Pacific would continue to increase its external effort and to reduce the risk of the high seas and the tides that would occur as soon as possible.

The Swiss family: John Lewis is a fighter for the weakest.
A member of the United States Congress, John Lewis (John Lewis) was remembered at his follow-up on Saturday (July 25th) as a "war for the weakest".
The public follow-up to the show began on Saturday in Alabama.
On the first day, there were two follow-up meetings.
At a public follow-up meeting at the University of Troy, Alabama, on Saturday, five of the brothers and a nephew of Lewis spoke of him as a loving, fearless man who was a family member.
Henry "Grant" Lewis, the youngest brother of Lewis, said in the meeting, "He's committed to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother warned John: "Don't worry, don't worry."
He added that John didn't listen to his mother's warning, and he said, "We all know that John's going to be in trouble, always in trouble, but that's because he's right, that's a good trouble."
John's most famous argument was to create a "good problem" for the people at the follow-up meeting, which was just to be fair and not to avoid the cause of the incident.
John once applied for a place at Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but at the time he refused to attend school at the University of Troy in the White House.
This little time, John Lewis, who announced the good news to the dog on his farm, eventually graduated from the School of Religion and Philosophy at the University of Fisk.
Several years later, the University of Troy awarded Dr. Lewis honorary degree.
Doug Jones, National Council Senator of Alabama, said that the current protesters "are peaceful, non-violent protests", just as Luis did in the civil rights movement.
He said: "Even if President Tranquip had turned his back on a ship, all the opposition people would have been cruel, but he was wrong.
Protesters are lovers, and they want the United States to join a more equitable country. "
A series of six-day events to commemorate Zeus will be held this week at the funeral of the state of Georgia.
On Saturday's Sunday, the St. Louis tree stopped in public memory activities at the University of Troy, where people had previously expressed their respect for this civil rights movement.
On Saturday, six nights, a private ceremony was held in a small church in Selma (Selma) in Alabama.
On Sunday, Louis' remains will be passed through the Edmon Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and his demand for the right to vote against the black people were wounded by the police in the state of Alabama before this bridge, and the police were also sending them to the demonstrators.
Weiss was almost killed at the time.
This day is called "The Blood Week".
The remains of Zeus will be transported to the capital of Montgomery, Alabama.
Steven Reed, mayor of the city, encouraged people to walk on the team and to complete this final phase with Louis.
At the same time, officials requested that the public be involved in their activities and keep the social distance.
Kay Ivey, head of the state of Alabama, ordered half of the flag down on Saturday and Sunday to commemorate Zeus.
In the recent Memorial season, the remains of Zeus will be divided into the Parliament of Alabama, the Assembly of the State of Mongolia, the Assembly of Georgia, the Assembly of the State of Atlantis, and the United States Assembly of Washington for the sake of public reflection.
The President of the United States Parliament, Nancy Pelosi (Nancy Pelosi) and the Head of the majority of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, announced on the weekend that people could express their respect to the House of the United States of America on Tuesday and Tuesday.

It's an open-ended health regulation, and it's a new network.
On 26 July, the New York Society encouraged the use of biopsy and early detection of the population; prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; establishing a network game health review system; preparing a unit for special-service and health managers prior to the "Purchase Special Economic Health Regulations (requirement)" published in the Official Journal of the Economic Area, which will have its own "health law".
In order to encourage resident nationals to do physical examinations and to find out the problems of early detection, the health sector should draw up a basic directory of health examination projects based on different ages, such as professions.
The cost of health care in the basic directory of the health inspection project is paid by the social health insurance fund each year by the standard of each year.
In order to make it clear that individual units should reasonably adjust human resources, arrange time for staff to work, work more heavily for mental and physical work, and implement a rotational system to avoid excessive damage to human health or physical health while strictly implementing a worker's pension system.
In addition, personnel are required to be equipped with specialized and regular health managers and to carry out staff health examinations.
In relation to the health of minors, a proposal was made to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors while limited to the sale of alcoholic beverages and would be corrected by the market surveillance authority by order of 30,000 fines.
In addition to "containing alcohol", minors also need " multiple movements " .
In accordance with the request for an opinion, schools are required to schedule more than one hour of school sports each day.
The health control system at Internet service stations should be improved for network games, public, cultural tourism, web-based tourism, health control and health, and the establishment of a network game health review system to promote healthy communication between young people and cultures in order to promote the growth of young people's health.
In addition, in order to obtain an opinion, it is necessary to wear a mask in public places for patients who are infected with flu and medical institutions who do not consent to disclose private compensation for 20,000 dollars for the patient without consent.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical health of the population, it is also requested that deep-rooted sectors in the development of urban space planning and construction, in the industrial field planning and construction, in resource development, in use with environmental protection, in normative documents, and in the approval of major construction projects and in the implementation of major public services projects should be assessed on the impact of public policies on public health on the public.
Unassessed or evaluated would have a more serious adverse impact on urban public health or population health, it is not necessary to draw up or approve the implementation.

In recent days, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled in his trial in the province of Gilin, that it was essential to strengthen the leadership of the Party, to promote the expansion of the party ' s core and to provide strong assurances for the governance of the urban community.
Continuation of the leadership of the Party ' s leadership in all areas of basic governance is a fundamental requirement for good governance.
The promotion of the basic governance level requires the strength of the party's leadership, the strengthening of political leadership, the building of the battle gates, the accumulation of red forces, the political advantages of the party, the transformation of the organizational advantages and the advantages of the public work, the transfer of the party's strength and claim to "the last mile".
Focusing on satisfying the spirit of self-restraint and strengthening political leadership.
Strengthening the political leadership of basic governance must be well implemented by the "supplementary soul" project.
In order to deepen the understanding of the concept of special socialism in China as a primary mission for the new generation of China, to develop "not to forget, remember the mission" as a party's permanent topics and life-threatening subjects, to strengthen reading the principles of original education, to divide training, to exchange, to organize and further promote the innovative theory of the Party's peace of mind, to further enhance the "four senses", to strengthen the "4" self-confidence" of the Party's commitment, to make the "two maintenance" better fulfilled.
Through online means of learning combined with online, the wide-ranging learning channel of education, which leads to the genuine integration of learning in education and regularity by the Ministry of Basic Party organizations and members of the Party.
Focusing on practices of fraud, focusing on difficult issues in the areas of decentralization of the rule of law, concern for the people's concerns, resolve their concerns and resolve their problems, and strengthen their partnership and capacity.
I'm going to make a fight.
It is an important part of the basic governance system, and it is an important element of its governance capacity.
Promoting the normalization of the ground-based organizations, with the introduction of regulations for the work of the Department of the Parties, leading to weakening and falsifying issues, through the establishment of the above-mentioned mechanisms, the establishment of a dynamic mechanism, the establishment of the Department of Innovation, the normalization of the weak distribution, the establishment of a healthy decision-making mechanism, a service-making community mechanism, a solid basis, a framework, a framework for development.
In rural areas, the standardization of village-level organizations, the implementation of systems such as the standardization of building standards for the Department of the Party's support, the format of regular organizations, learning activities, management mechanisms, and the effective promotion of the "Three Meeting", thematic Party Day activities.
In urban areas, attention was given to street communities, research into the form of the establishment of the Department of Innovation, the concentration of weak areas, the "petch" of pain, and the active building of the Alliance of Urban Parties to effectively cover the work of the parties.
At the same time, the establishment of a system of sound and sound governance mechanisms, a common community of the General Assembly, a common one, a common one, an emergency communiqué, a difficult common understanding of decision-making mechanisms led by the CSOs, a mechanism for improving the integration of the CSOs, a public service mechanism for the People ' s Hearts, an increased access to the public service, a sense of happiness, a sense of dignity, and a sense of self-government.
Play the first role, gather the red force.
The Ministry of Base-Parties is the cornerstone of basic governance.
The development of the basic governance capacity, which focuses on enhancing the governance capacity of the Ministry of Deputies, focussing on the role of the " Red cells" in the core governance, and collecting the most powerful red energy in contact with the service population.
The development of governance capacity as the necessary training of the Ministry of Base-Parties will continue to strengthen thinking ability, professional training, practice skills, and the deployment of a spirit in the critical task force in this position of emergency and contribute to the modernization of national governance systems and governance capacity.
A wide range of " community slump, party members report " activities, link the difficult population through thematic party day activities, identify service projects, acknowledge micro-deserts, make reasonable recommendations, participate in community-building, management and services, and enable parties to play a role in community governance.
In order to play a full role in the role of rural non-combatants, through the establishment of non-combatants, the creation of a non-posting team, and the creation of a broad-based group of actors who are actively involved in the eradication of poverty, eco-building, confidence-building, sustainable development, the detonation of fuel, and better integration of the red force for civil service.
The base is strong.
The base-level party organization is the headquarters of the governorate.
The only way to strengthen the relationship between close party groups, increase the prosperity of the people as a point of view, build the party's leadership as a basic way of promoting the innovation of basic governance is to bring them out, to the top, to the Ministry of Degree and to the top, to the top, to the top, to promote the "soul" of the basic governance, to be orderly, powerful and effective.

Kokoshi's hiding sheep in the spring.
Newspapers from the three-year-old National Park Manager, Koshiri, were informed of the five-way protection stations in Koshiri, where the newly arrived in the Koshiri region of the Koshiry region, where the shepherd village of the island of Kashmir, who had died, was on its way to complete the nest and began to return to its native pasture.
The scene of surveillance near the five guard stations shows that on 25 July, about 40 male goats were the only three male sheep that were buried on the ground through the 3002 km of the hill road, and the five-wheeled northern bridge had begun to relocate.
In recent years, a quarter to five percent of the total number of flocks of sheep is collected in the flock.
The Deputy Research Institute of the University of Chechnya, the University of China, also stated: "In the early stages, the flock is at a higher risk of being caught, so the number of young children in the flock would be smaller, even if there were no children. "
According to the statistics available in the Koshiri Management Board of the National Park Manager, the total number of flocks of sheep is rising year by year and the number of flocks of sheep is only 4860 in 2019 and only 338 increase by 2018.
In fact, it is expected that this year's shepherding will be completed in early September and that the number of shepherds will continue to grow. "
Protect the animals at the national level of the flock.
At the end of May each year, from the spring to the west to the mountains of the mountains of Al-Qa`in, all the flocks of al-Qadar are heading to the lake of saltwater in the region of Kokoshi.
My country's conservation expert, and researchers from the University of San Francisco (Northern American Institute for Biological Research) said: "The conservation of sheep is a process that continues to take young children back to the breeding grounds. The population of the breeding community of natives begins to grow larger, but then the herd will return to their own breeding grounds according to different geographical groups. "
In order to ensure the safe return of the flock of sheep to safety, the journalists were informed that the Koshiri Management Office had organized its staff in the main area of return and continued to carry out video monitoring and judicial patrols in the area of the former three-year-old State Park Manager.
If hidden flocks were to be tried across the road, the patrolling team would exercise temporary traffic control for the first time and ensure that they are safe through the wild animal pathways and that they are subjected to the least possible human interference on their way back.
So, how do you figure out what it's like to be in everyday life?
The experts suggest that the best way out of summer is to avoid high temperatures and that it is best not to walk or work under the hot sun before noon, as the most powerful sun in this period is to occur in the middle.
If it is necessary to leave at this time, it is necessary to do a good job of protection, such as to wash the sun, to wash the sun, to wear the sun, and to avoid injury.
The best way to get dressed is to use the color, the temperature of the hair, the softness of the hair, the quality of the hair, the wear of the hair, so that you can't get hot when you're out of a lot of hunger.
When the temperature is warm, be prepared to drink enough water, drink in a timely manner, and do not wait to drink water, because when you feel that your mouth has lost water, you have to control the water to 200 milligrams each time you drink hot water and do not drink ice water.
According to the low temperature, the general staff drink 1.5 to 2 litres a day, and high-temperature workers and 3 to 5 litres a day.
More than one hour of hunger would be sufficient to supplement some of the water and fill the human body's loss due to hunger.
In addition, it is easy for the summer people to get tired and feel tired, and with tea and tea are a very good drink.
The high levels of water in the summer, such as fruits, vegetables, vegetables, and so on, and fresh fruits, such as wheat, barley, sieves and sugar, can be used to fill the water; milk products can fill both the water and satisfy the physical needs.
In addition, those working in high-temperature environments should be appropriately complemented with the ingredients of pellets and pellets.
The sun's short, warm night, the freshness of the human body, and the abundance, it's easy to feel hungry.
A full sleep can relieve both brain and body systems, as well as prevention measures for work and learning.
Experts claim that the best bedtime is 22 to 23 hours, and the best bedtime is 5.30 to 630 minutes.
When sleeping, be careful not to lie under air and electricity so as to avoid airborne illness and heat damage.
Experts suggest that in the event of an outpatient activity or high-performance group, it can be used to prevent the occurrence of dehydration at a place of work, including 10 per cent of water, human waste water, sanitation or sanitation.
I'd like everyone to think of a very simple fact that, to date, we understand most of the universe from light.
We stand on the earth looking at the night sky and we can see the stars in the sky with our physical eyes.
The sun is so bright in its own eyes.
We can see the light coming back from the moon.
From Galileo to his simple celestial telescope to the celestial bodies in the universe, to this day, we know the universe through the light of our eyes.
With the help of modern planetary telescopes, we have been able to collect a wide range of images of the invisible universe -- this series of images can be traced to a huge explosion.
But the universe is not a mystery, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell everyone that the universe has its own company, and that the universe itself is constantly playing because space can move as much as we can.
So when something big happens, it can send a series of voices to the universe.
Now, we want to be able to give this amazing vision of the universe a voice.
Although we've never heard a voice coming from outer space, we should be able to raise the volume in the next few years, and listen to what happened there.
We focus our attention on the black hole and the future it shows, because when the black hole is able to hit the air, it's going to send a very special sound, and I'm happy to play some of the sounds we predict.
One day we might be able to see a shadow, a black hole can remain a shadow in a very bright background, but it has not yet been observed.
Although the holes can't be seen, they may be heard, because they're empty when they hit like a storm.
This idea that the universe can send out the same noise comes from Albert Einstein, which is actually from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except for the extra lines above.
But if we fall free in the universe, even if we don't have these auxiliary lines, we'll draw these lines, because we're going to find us next to a direct movement, along a straight line that doesn't happen through the universe.
Einstein also realized that -- this is the most important part (but also "material" matter) -- if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe will collapse.
That's the vast contrast between Einstein.
Even the path of light will be broken.
When the explosions have reached a certain extent, they'll turn around the direction of the solar movement, like the earth around the sun and the moon around the earth.
It's a natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you cut the sun into a six-mile ball -- that is, if you cut down a million-fold material relative to the earth's quality -- you're going to create a hole, and this object's density is very high, so that if you leave it too close, you can't escape-- there's a big black hole in the universe.
But Einstein has always considered black holes to be just a mathematical point.
He doesn't believe there's really a dark hole.
He believed that nature would stop the formation of the dark hole to protect us.
After decades, people began using the word "black hole" and realized that the black hole was a real star -- in fact, they were some of the great qualities of stars at the end of their lives, and they had a disastrous post-mortem dying condition.
Our sun won't shrink into a dark hole.
It's not really big enough.
But if we've done some thinking experiments -- Einstein really likes to do this -- we can imagine that we're going to press the sun in six kilometers, and then put a small planet around its orbit, like on a 30-mile route from the black hole.
The earth will shine itself, because the sun is gone, and we have no other source of light -- so our little planet will shine itself.
You'll find out you can even put the earth on the track outside 30 kilometers away from the dark hole and make it run happily.
This black hole, in fact, is just as big as Domanhaton.
Before it destroys the earth, it may fall to Hudson Street.
But that's basically what we're talking about.
What we're talking about is one thing that's pressed into Manhattan half the size of the object.
So we move this planet to a place close to the black hole, 30 kilometers away – we notice it runs along a perfect orbital black hole.
There's some tradition that black hole will burn everything in the universe, but actually you'll have to get out of it very close.
But it's very impressive that from our perspective, we can always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light sent out from the earth fell into the dark hole, but some of it was broken down after we saw it.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If that's what you're fighting with the Sionians, don't hide behind the dark hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not shrink into a dark hole; its quality is not large enough, but there are thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them is in the pumpkin system, it looks like it's going to be like this.
We're going to see a shadow of a dark hole, a billion stars in the galaxy, and an elixir of the sunlight.
If we turn around to this dark hole, we'll see the light burst around the dark hole, and even when we start entering this shadow, we won't even feel some great changes are happening.
If we're trying to launch the rocket and get out of there, it's not gonna be good, because we can't run away, nor can the light run away.
Although black holes look dark out there, but there's no such thing in there, because all the lights of the constellations can fall together with us into black holes.
And even so, because of the relative timing, our time seems to be slow compared to the time of the galaxy, which seems to be as if the outer planets are speeding up, before we are destroyed by ourselves.
It's like the death of an animal, you've seen the light of the tunnel, but it's a perfect experience of death.
(Laughter) You didn't tell anyone you saw light on the street.
So far, we've never seen such a dark hole left, but black holes can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Imagine, in a true astronomical perspective -- imagine the two of them already have a long dark hole.
Maybe they were stars before, and then they cut into two black holes -- each quality was 10 times the sun.
Now we'll cut them in 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times every second.
At the top of their lives, they are rapidly approaching each other.
In a few seconds, they can pass thousands of miles.
The dark hole, when it hits the universe, causes space to collapse and spread.
These motions spread rapidly in space.
This computer model was completed by the relative group of Goudads of the National Aviation Agency.
It took almost 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes around the opposite side, these are the curves in the picture.
As you've seen, there may be some patterns-- you can see that the red ball is fired, and these are the lead ball.
They're actually the sound of the universe, and these voices will be spread out from these black holes in the process of interacting with one another in the black hole, until the two black holes are joined together into a dark hole that turns into a quiet circle.
If you stand close enough, your ears will produce condoms with these spaces.
You can really hear these sounds.
Of course, you'll find your head pressed and stretched out, so you may not understand what really happened.
But I'd like to play for you.
This is my group's research results -- a relatively simple calculation model.
Imagine a smaller black hole falling into a larger black hole.
The sound you heard came from a small-quality black hole in the process of approaching a large-scale black hole with space.
If they were far away, the sound would be very small.
But the loud voice becomes like a wave of thunder that touches the space, making space move like a storm.
We can predict what this sounds like.
We know that in the process of falling down, the little black hole will grow faster and the sound that is sent out will be more bright.
Finally, we'll hear the little black hole completely down into the big black hole.
I never thought this voice was so loud-- here it was actually raised.
When you hear it at home, it feels like it's a little too loud.
It sounds like, um, uh, uh, uh,
That's another sound that's modelled by our research team.
I'm not going to show you a picture here, because the black hole won't leave any useful clues, and the real space won't show you those fake curves.
But if you're in the middle of the universe, I suggest you run.
(Laughter) Better hurry away from this voice.
These two black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In such a situation, they're all being severely beaten.
And then, they'll be integrated into one.
The sound of the bell is a sign of black hole integration, and when it's over, the sound of the bell will sound.
This is what we'll see about what we'll do.
Luckily, we're very safe in the Governor of the Caribbean.
It's suspected that two black holes in some part of the universe have been incorporated together.
The same suspects that the space around us can also feel these over a million years of light, or ever since a million years ago, they've been able to spread light and finally meet us.
But these voices are so small that we can't hear them.
Some of the world's experiments need to build a lot of hearts -- one of which is called LIGO -- it will be able to check every four kilometers of distance, smaller than an atomic nuclear level.
It's a very serious attempt, and in the years to come, it's not going to be overemphasized -- it's going to be used to test space movement.
Another research project on the universe was expected to start in the next decade, called Lisa.
Lisa will be able to see a super-quality black hole -- those qualities are millions of times even billions of times in the sun.
We see these two stars in the picture from Hae-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Looks like they're stuck together.
Their center may be a large, high-quality super black hole.
But they're not slowing down, they're actually integrating.
These two black holes will be hit, and their integration will take billions of years.
That's why we're looking for the sound that they're sending out and that's beyond our feelings.
But Lisa can see that the last phase of the super-quality black hole that occurred before it was too early, is 15 minutes before they were integrated.
This observation is not only limited to a dark hole, but it can be used to detect any major disturbances in the universe -- the largest of which is the number of "the great explosion of the universe."
When this word was created, some people began to say, "Oh, who would believe the universe explodes?"
This is a short film I produced in Proton Studios' friends showing the scene from outside looking at a huge explosion.
We're really not going to want to do that; we want to put it inside the universe, because there's nothing like this outside the universe.
So, imagine you're in a big explosion.
There's nothing in the universe. Everything around you around the universe.
It's been 1400 million years, and it's still ringing around us.
The planets gradually formed, and a number of stars formed in the star system. On some planet, at least one such planet exists, suitable for life.
Here, we're going to go crazy and build a test, calculate, write computer code.
Just imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes broke up.
This sound has always been in the air all the time.
We're not even here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago, we're still painting on the wall of the cave.
If the sound we want is the explosion of the universe, it sounds like that.
Seriously, it's loud.
It's a white voice, a confused voice.
But it's nowhere around us, unless it's rejected by some other processes in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, for our ears it would be like music, because this quiet response comes from the moment we were created, from the universe that we are looking forward to.
So in the next few years, we'll be able to raise the volume of these music, let the universe show us in the form of music.
But if we can figure out the earliest moments, it will also make us understand more apart from the big explosions, enable us to track some of the most difficult problems, while the most embarrassing issues.
If we're going down to play the history of the universe, we can know that there's been a big explosion in the past, and we can even hear the mixed voice, but is our big explosion the only major explosion in the universe?
I mean, we're not going to stop asking if there's been a similar explosion before?
Will the future never happen again?
I would like to say that if we raise the meaning of this issue to this level of rethinking that TED advocates, at least in the last minute, we can ask some questions, which we may never answer.
But we don't forbid to ask: Will our universe not be just a part of a bigger history?
Or else, we would not just have a fraction of the vast universe -- each part had its own huge explosion -- maybe some of them had a dark hole, some of them might not -- maybe there was a conscious life, some might not exist -- they were not our past, they were not our future, but they were in some way connected with us?
So, we can't wait to guess if there's a multibillion universe, in the rest of the universe, there's life?
This is our life in this multibillion universe.
Is there any other life in the universe that they wouldn't even assume of our existence, considering their origins?
If that's the case, I can imagine they're just like us, they're counting, they're making computer codes, they're building a test machine, they're trying to figure out the micro-voices that came from their origins, and they're wondering who else is there.
Thank you, everyone.
(Applause)
I'm going to go to the market for the promotion of the art of graduate life.
During the season of the Schools 'Studies', the weekend was a hard time for the art of professional life on a difficult line.
However, it will continue to be open to the public until 23 August, both at the Medieval Museum and in the school yard, and it will be open free to the public.
Newspapers have learned that this 2020 graduate art exhibition is composed of the Central American Academy, the 50th/group of 57 young artists from the Chinese Media University and the University of Chemistry, and the exhibition of space from 2nd to 6th level, and the full use of medium-sized works from inside the building, with the highest coverage of the graduate period.
Under the circumstances of the vaccine, the significance of this exhibition is particularly evident.
The head of the U.S. mayor of Korea made the statement: "We choose to take back space from the graduation of the 'Sun', and we also want more people to see their own research and understanding of the world and to increase the healing power of the society and the spirit."
She explained that this exhibition was a collection of graduates from several universities of art and chose from among them appropriate commercial space, from traditional drawings, sculptures, to new media devices, interaction, VR overviews, and material and richness for the most recent years.
Among them, through the creation language of the machine and manual mix of machines in the first war of 2020, Liège expressed her feelings in this situation; by the production of "Sound Money" created in the middle of the area, he explored "encrypted money" , "trust created" , "trade" the theme of the house "cats" and the strong" animals that are often associated with humans , from which young artists can see the meaning of their relationship with animals; and the creation of the fish is a "believe - gift" that reminds young people of growing up when there is a day-to-day work, not to remember that simple and true.
In a number of self-deployed graduates, there are the honours that come from the University of São Tomé and Príncipe.
"I came to Beijing on 7 July, when it was a little worried about the vaccine situation, and three days ago I did a nuclear test, which was presented with a symmetrical and test report. "
His work was more complicated than the structure of the last day, and he had to be close.
At the same time, he also had the task of helping fellow students to repair damages.
"Show up to four and a half in the morning, and then refurbish it, it's hard, it's forgotten, it's a picture, it's a little sad."
He wanted to see his work when the vaccine was more stable and his fellow students came to Beijing.
(New York Times)
On the morning of the year 65, Bosonaro, who is now 65 years old, posted a photo on Twitter, on which he wore a sports shoes, did not wear a mask, sat on a table in front of a breakfast table, smiles, and a hand made a big ring, and another hand made up a box of chlorofluorocarbons.
He wrote: "Good morning, everyone! The results of the new vaccine test: cirrhosis."
However, Bosonaro did not mention when this new vaccine was tested.
On 5 July, Bosonaro was diagnosed with a new vaccine, and on 6 July he received the result of a virus test, and on 7 July he declared himself infected with a new vaccine through television.
On 14 and 21 days, Bosonaro once again conducted a new test of chromium virus, and the result remains sunny.
In a period of separation, Bosonalo has demonstrated its use of chlorophylls directly through social media, and has shown that chlorofluorocarbons have good effects on new chromium treatment, and that after their use, they have a good effect on chlorophytosanitary conditions, which suggest that Brazilian medical institutions use new chlorofluorocarbons to treat them.
According to the Brazilian media, there are currently five ministers and 10 government ministers in Brazil who have been infected with a new vaccine.
A small plane destroyed by Mount Alvins in Switzerland, and four of them suffered on the plane -- a new network.
On 26 July, a small plane destroyed in the mountains of Al-Qaida, Switzerland, according to a news report from the EU. On 25 July, the Swiss police informed the media that on 25 July, a small plane was destroyed in the mountains of Al-Qaida in Switzerland.
Two Swiss and two Austrians were in the middle of the accident.
Police statement from Wallis, South Wales, Switzerland, has been reported to have reported that a small plane destroyed more than 3,000 metres of the sea near Mount Albens, in the state of Valai, and confirmed that the rescue personnel had been hit by an accident, and that all of the four passengers in the airport had suffered.
The state police state police reported to the police at 12.25 a.m. on 25 a.m. and said he saw a small plane fall from the sky.
A few minutes later, the observers again informed the police that the airport had collapsed.
The police quickly coordinate fire officers, medical personnel and rescue personnel after receiving police reports and carrying helicopter relief sites.
After the rescue personnel arrived at the airport, four of them found themselves in difficulty.
The police verified that the victims of the accident included two Swiss persons aged 50 and 66, as well as two Austrians aged 46 and 50.
The police indicated that the police were currently working with the Swiss Transport Safety Investigation Commission to investigate the cause of the accident.
It's a new network in 33 districts, and it's raining.
On July 26th, the newsmagazine was announced from the Reincineration City Water Station, and in the past 24 hours, 33 districts were flooded, 16 of which were flooded with torrential rains.
The storm caused a heavy downpour of 71 small rivers, which had previously been launched by two flood warnings.
According to the monitoring of the main water stations in the city, most of the areas were in a storm, and the earthquake was in the area from 8 to 26 hours a day.
The tsunami, the tsunami, the river, the 33 districts of the river, the faithful city, the open state, the 16 of the districts of the Himalayas, and the largest day of rain falls in the mountains of the South China Mountains, 197.5 mm.
There are between 1 and 7 metres in the middle of the river, which is the highest level of water protection.
It is expected that between 8 and 27 p.m., small river flows may occur in the vast region, and that individual river flows may occur in excess of the water supply.
At the same time, the locals will also pay attention to the dams and the river basins that may be present in transit waters.
CBA came to the first audience after the rehearsal, and wanted to see how the post-second session was to focus on these new networks.

According to CBA's official news, the CBA's online client's website finally arrives at the first stage of the game after the game is re-entered, according to the CBA's official news.
On 31 July, the current watch game included staff and doctors, teachers, public security personnel, and more people who contributed to society during the period of vaccination, officially engaged in the post-CBA campaign, which would also be formally re-suspended on the sale of ballasts.
Infected by the vaccine, the CBA began replaying on 20 June, after a period of almost five months.
Although the audience was few in attendance on the 26th afternoon, it was clear that there were people in tears, while others were silent.
The football team's relatively low level is also in the Chamber, and such a picture has not been seen for a long time.
In the afternoon, if you want to watch the scene, you'll have to pay attention.
The location of this open-label ballistics polling station is a diamond sports centre in New Zealand, which sells full-time shopping tickets on the line, under the system of real-time inputs, all games are 12 years old, and has a record of 48 hours of nuclear testing.
It's worth 50,000 dollars.
On 26 July, the North Sea Report (New Zealand Journalist Lynch) announced that a significant contribution was made by the local disaster point monitor to the São Paulo early warning, and that he was sent to $50,000.
At the same time, he was called by the Department of Civil Affairs to learn to perform his duties, to be careful, to take the initiative, as a spirit of dedication.
On 21 July, the village of Malao-Maahu in the city of En-Sao, which led to the clear formation of the river of the river into the lake of Seine, a 58-year-old light, was the first person to warn the river.
On the afternoon of 17 July, it became clear that the walls of the village were broken and that they were immediately searched.

New drugs at the University of Australia are expected to be used for the treatment of new vaccines.
Research staff at the University of Monash, Australia, were developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and respiratory problems on 26 July, and hoped that such drugs could be used to treat cancer caused by the new vaccines.
Researchers have found that before a heart attack or a heart attack, a clot in the blood will accelerate the clotting of the platelet.
Therefore, they develop a drug that can temporarily inhibit blood clots and thus prevent blood clots and prevent heart disease and heart failure.
Studies indicate that these drugs can interfere with the convulsions of the blood vessels only when a heart attack occurs or a heart attack.
Because similar blood clots have been shown to be one of the main causes of the deaths of new carcinogens, researchers hope that this medicine will be used in the future for the treatment of such patients.
At present, the drug has had a good effect on animal model experiments and researchers are preparing to undergo human hospital trials at the next stage.
The results have been published in the United States of America's journal "Scientific Transformational Medicines".

More than 6,000 dollars per five-sided solar clocks, each 48-metre-meter round, such as a bank "to the sun", moving from the sun to a 200-metre-higher solar power station.
This event was seen on 25 days by journalists in the mid- power plant of Izong-Mahumi Lake, New Hammy.
"The so-called thermal heat source is that the sun can be re-rescinded through the mirror into the heat formation, and that it can be converted into electricity through traditional power generation technologies. "
The Deputy Director-General of the Central and Central Chemistry Electricity Limited reported that the sun should be collected in the same way as the original sun used in rural areas in the north of China.
The electricity station was launched in October 2017 and was completed and online at the end of the last year, with a total of 6,600 tons and a total planned installation of 14,500 clocks.
"Its greatest advantage is that the combined heat storage of the sun is also possible at night. "
It was said that the 13-hour heating system of the project could maintain the continuous operation of the CDC and not be affected by light change; it could also be able to accommodate the flow of electricity quickly based on the needs of the Internet.
After the project has been fully built, the annual output of $198 million can be achieved, which can save more than 6 million tons per year, reduce more than 60 tons of CO2, more than 60 tons of oxygen, about 20 tons of tobacco, more than 15 million tons of CO2, and provide ongoing energy for local sources.
In addition, there is another color "to the sunflower field" in the mining industry in the city of Hami.
The Hamining Sun power station has a capacity of over 2,300 litres, and 714 electric equipment has been built in the same direction as the sun, keeping the sun and the panels at 90 degrees.
" We will maintain electricity efficiency on the basis of the high-strength adjustment of the sun by using double-track lighting technology, by combining combined control. "
The station's high-end dreamer said that, under a bright climate, the more traditional electricity generation technology could increase by about 20 per cent.
In the last half of this year, the power station has reached more than 700 million power stations, complementing local power requirements.
The city-based lighting industry is now the largest of the new units, the most complete model of the lighting industry, with 38 electricity projects, totaling 88,000.
More than 1 billion electricity outputs have been completed in the last half of this year and 6 per cent increase in the same period in 2019.
Hamin is one of the best areas of China's solar resources.
The average annual average sun radiation is more than 6200 m/h, and the average daily rate is approximately 3200 hours.
In recent years, the city's highly developed lighting industry, which is a good "to the Himalayas".

The U.S. media has opened up a new network to shut down China's capital building in Houston.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Central TV: Sustenance Editor: Sustenance
The U.S. media has opened up the truth of China's closing the General House in Houston.
On 24 days, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the United States Embassy that the Central Party had decided to withdraw its permission to establish and operate the United States General Council and to suspend all operations and activities of the General Council as a measure against the United States General Assembly on 21 March as a direct request for the Middle East to close the General Assembly in Houston.
The United States Government is concerned about this act and its political motivation has been challenged by foreign media and scholars.
Why would the Central want to close the General Chamber?
Many external media have claimed that it is not clear why the United States is elected as the capital of China in Houston, but for the purpose of this movement, the external media has expressed itself unambiguously: for the general election.
The United States online television news network (CNN) 23 reported that the United States demanded that the Central Party close its movement in the Hussein General Chamber to cause people to question their political motivation.
The article states that the United States Government's response to the disaster of the new vaccine situation has led to a lower rate of civilization support by President Tranop before the major elections.
The White House officials claim in private that the strong strategy for China is to save the support rate of Tranop, while also to transfer the responsibility for the failure of the White House.
The article considers China's General Library in Houston to be a "political drive" chosen by the United States, a very careful "objection," and the US Government elected it "to create a strong attitude, while avoiding the risk of major conflicts".
The British Broadcasting Company (BBC) also believes that the United States economy has been severely affected during the United States elections and that Tranop has "the political advantage of China's card".
The current situation is a "study-up and counter-attack fight", which, to a certain extent, has been driven by the US Government's approach to national perspectives, and only the tension between the Americas has become even worse.
The American Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS) reported that Trenup's joint prospects were hampered by the outbreak of the epidemic and that he was again accused of being indicted by the state of China.
The United States has almost every day a new approach to the so-called "China Explosion of the United States of America".
"The Hoston General is very important in establishing two countries' contacts."
The United States commented that the United States requested China to shut down the General Library in Houston to increase the tension between the world's largest two economies.
In addition to the diplomatic implications of the closing of the Chinese General Hospital in Houston, it is also difficult for citizens of China in the South of the United States to have access to consular services and to seek visas and other services.
A business group in Houston regretted the fact that the United States requested China to shut down the General House in Houston that the General Chamber had played an important role in the establishment of trade, investment and cultural links in two countries.
The U.S. believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy website "The U.S. Web site considers this movement to be part of a series of challenging initiatives that will only undermine the relationship between the United States".
Since the establishment of a comprehensive diplomatic relationship between the two countries of the United States of America in 1979, it has been suggested that no movement could be compared to the United States' action towards the General Council of China in Houston, China.
Hong Kong's "South War Early" reported that the American movement was not previously in the 40-year diplomatic relationship between the two countries of Central America.
The analyst believes that this movement could lead to lasting damage.
The China General Hall in Houston was built in 1979, the first General Hall in China, established in the United States.
At present, China has a embassy and five general hospitals in the United States.

New changes in the control of vaccines have occurred, and since 17 July, the National Trade Union has responded to the call of the General Labour Union in the region of self-government and has been actively involved in the prevention of vaccines.

Speaker at the Embassy: China Government is a strong defender of network security - new network
On 26 July, according to a news website from China to the British Embassy on 25 July, China's spokesman in the British Embassy asked about the network attackers concerned.
The speaker stressed that the Government of China was a strong defender of network security and consistently opposed and combated any form of network attacks and network crime.
Journalists have questioned: According to the media, a British company's network system has been breached by a British company's network that attacks British technology companies with patent data and attacks on the EU's national government network.
The speaker stated that the Government of China was a strong defender of network security and consistently opposed and combated any form of network attacks and network crime.
There should be sufficient evidence to be found in the case of investigations and static network events that cannot be denied.
The speaker said that a series of events, such as the old "Speech", had shown that the United States had been engaged in the most extensive global network operation.
The peace and stability of the network space is in line with the common interests of all States.
The speaker noted that China's achievements in technology innovation were not stolen, not stolen, but were struggled with self-reliance.
In 2019 China submitted approximately 5.9% of its applications through the "Clarity Cooperation Treaty" (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, becoming the largest country in the submission of an international patent application.
China has become the great country of the right to innovation and intellectual property.
The Bank of the People ' s Bank of China has shown that in the last half years, new loans for agriculture and micro-enterprises have increased throughout the year more than 2019.
In the last half of this year, the Bank of the People's Bank has used several monetary policy tools to lead the banking industry to increase its lending strength and provide adequate financial guarantees for the prevention and recovery of vaccines.
The majority of the U.S. free carbon testing areas in the U.S. are essentially completed.
On 26 July, the new Central Network (New Zealand Journalist and Human Rights) announced that the majority of the work areas of the Uruguay City Free Nuclear Control had been thoroughly completed on 26 days, informing of the latest vaccinations and testing of acids in the city of Urumumi.
The National Hospital Expert Group and the Self-governance Area, the City of Urumezi, are assessing the development of vaccines based on the results of the nuclear tests and the research into communicable diseases.
The 26th press release of the News Office of the New Zealand Self-Government Region was convened on 26 days to inform the press about the situation of the New Zealand virus and the prevention of it.
According to him, from 0 to 24 July, 22 cases of new lung cancer in the city of Urumazi (of which 5 cases were transacted by non-communicable infections), 38 cases of new infections.
As at 24 July, there were 135 cases in the city of Urumazi, 147 cases of unsympathetic infections.
The 25-year-old new non-sympathetic infections are also mainly identified through the free testing of the entire city.
On 26 days, the Director-General of the City of Urumezi Health said that most areas of the work of the Uruminian city were essentially completed.
He also said that from experience in other parts of the country, there were many factors that affected the results of the tests, such as the sensitivity of the test medicinal products, the time of infection and the time of eradication of the test personnel, the time of the labelling of the testants when they were taken, the level of professional activity of the investigators (problems likely to result in the absence of the label) and the level of the examination of the test personnel.
For various reasons, carbon testing also results in falseness.
The so-called falseness is that the investigators are indeed infected, but the results are toxic.
In addition, it is usually necessary to exclude two cases of chlorofluorocarbon testing for cases that appear to have been closely related to the disease.
In the case of individuals in high-risk areas in the past, if there is a fever and respiratory disease, there is a possibility that there may be a false presence of a nuclear test, and it is therefore necessary to avoid two nuclear tests.
In view of the above, for the physical health of the entire population of the city, Urumuzi has since begun to conduct a double-free nuclear review of mountain areas, such as Shavabak districts, and a "exploration of wastes" .
It is reported that the mountain range, Shavai Bakk, is a high risk area of infection.

Fuchy stated that some areas of the United States are currently struggling with the situation of the anti-fired vaccine.
Despite the differences in the situation in the area, there is a need for local response programmes, but the diversity of anti-dumping policies does not mean that there is no close link between the regions.
The situation in one area will eventually affect other areas.
"Now that we're not content," Fuchy said, "our work has not been completed, we have to intensify our efforts, and we have to remain alert to the uncertainty of the future."
The American medical expert, the author of the treatment of HIV "Currency Treatment Law" at the meeting, noted that the U.S. new vaccine conditions have not yet reached the top.
"Every one of us must do our utmost to reduce the spread of this virus."
It is a great call for the public to make time for scientists to accelerate the development of a new range of medicines and vaccines.
The International Leader Foundation is a non-profit organization that seeks to promote international exchange activities in the United States and in the Asia-Pacific region, which is committed to improving the Asian status of the United States and to developing international youth leaders.

Brazil's study showed that chlorofluorocarbons are not effective in treating cancer-in new networks.
A recent study in Brazil revealed that new cancer patients are not effective.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The study conducted a three-fold study of 667 patients in 55 hospitals in the national hospital, mainly for the use of chlorofluorocarbons or for the combination of other antiviral achiosones, and analysed whether it would help to improve the incidence of new cancers and middle-aged patients.
The results show that chlorofluorocarbons are not only effective in treatment but may be harmful side effects for the body.
The study was completed jointly with the Brazilian Medical Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Institute for Responsibilities (BRICRI) (BRI) (BRICNET) (HCor), the hospital for heart disease (HCor), the hospital for Lebanon (Hospital Sirio-Libanês).

Four sectors are running a new round of App's governance to protect personal information security-new-new network.
Newspapers from the National Network of 25 July, New York City (New York Times) were informed on 25 July that the use of personal information management in the recent days of the abuse of the law of the App was a major issue of the public's efforts to combat the problem of personal information from behind App.
It was reported that the governance of App was carried out jointly by national networks, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Public Security and the National Market Management Directorate-General.
It was suggested that last year the Task Management Working Group, composed of four sectors, accepted the information of the rest of the network effectively, conducted a verification of the 2300 remaining App, 260 public disclosures, and subsequent sanctions.
According to the relevant Heads of the National Network, the current number of Apps has been over 5 million, and the problem of violating the law of collecting personal information has not been resolved at all.
The governance work in 2020 will intensify further efforts and, on the basis of App verification, further expand the governance scope to SDK (software development tool package) and small procedures, etc.

United States Trade Representative Meeting in August
On 25 August, Hong Kong quoted an unknown informant as head of the Trade Group in China, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Ministry of State, co-chairs with the American Group, and the trade representative of the Red Sea could be expected to hold formal talks on August to assess the implementation of the first trade agreement between the parties in the United States.
It is reported that although China has significantly increased the number of United States agricultural products in the past few months, there is still a gap in the number of commitments made in the trade agreement due to factors such as the new pandemic virus.
Analysts say that in recent years, inter-sessional and other disputes can undermine any progress made by both parties in terms of trade.
The first phase of the trade agreement in Central America entered into force one month after the signing of 15 January, in which it provided for a high-level trade framework group, which should hold a meeting every half year.
It will be an important turning point for both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, he also said that if tension in the United States led to a lack of willingness to negotiate at this time, both parties might agree to hold a telephone meeting on 8 May, that is to say, in the course of a one-half-year discussion in the Trade Agreement.
Since this year, the Central American relationship has rapidly deteriorated, including a series of issues such as the origin of new chromium virus, trade, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Sea and Idea.
President Trannon of the United States has always been making progress at the beginning of the year in the first phase of the agreement, but the trend has changed.
He said at a press conference on 23 days, although China had bought a record of the number of U.S. mines in recent days, "but this trade agreement now meant that it was not as early as it was."
A well-known Beijing Government adviser also believes that a new round of trade negotiations could not be carried out because of poor relations between the United States and the United States.
He explained, however, that the 23-day meeting of the relevant Chinese Trade Unit was still under discussion on a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "we have already made every effort to buy, so any additional procurement would be difficult."
The Vice-President of the National Trade Commission of the United States of America, Jean-Marie, said that the continuation of the first phase agreement could be more important than ever, and China pointed out that this year China had made progress in further opening the financial market for the United States of America.
The independent research company analyst Plenum said: "It's better to talk than to talk, even though it may only be done."

The head of the province of Nasdak China: now is the best time for China's company to use IPO -- economic observation -- professional finance through the news website

And in the near future, we're looking for a car, and we're looking for a hot spot in the city.
Under the epidemic and the average crisis, is China's business the best time for a beautiful city?
"In the recent IPO cases and in the case of a company that wants to rent up the city, IPO has actually not been affected, but now the market is very good, even now is the best time line for China's 10 years. "
The Chief Representative of the China Region of the Nasdak Bank trade said at the "Communication of the Citizen-Chief of the Year 2020" held by Snowball.
In April this year, the United States Board of Auditors (SEC) and the United States Public Company Accounting Board (PCAOB) issued an " important statement on audit quality and control of access to audit and other international information - on the challenges of the current access to information on a large number of American companies in China " .
While international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the United States regulatory sector remains in existence with regard to access to information, SEC and PCAOB continue to face legal and practical challenges, and in line with that document, the list of top-ranking companies and their audit agencies are listed in large amounts.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States of America issued additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies in the United States.
It appears that the crisis in the stock market did not affect investors' mouth.
"The news has raised the fear of all people, and it is all possible to go to the United States in the future, but we have discovered that these issues are not a matter for investors, that investors may ask these issues in the recent American IPOs, even as a standardized issue, but that is not the important reason why investors are not investing in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that everyone take the utmost care of the current situation.
Of course, this appearance may appear to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but it has not been affected by the investor's mouth.
So from the end of this year or the United States elections, the temperature of the American IPO will continue. "
On 9 May this year, Kinshasa officially took over the city of Nasdak in the United States and became the first Chinese company to take over the U.S. IPO.

According to the authors, the high quality of Chinese companies in the United States of America in the last half of the year, which have a strong basic and growing quality company, would be more likely to be attracting investors.
From a short, medium, long time ago, the Chinese company continued to maintain a positive attitude toward the Chinese company IPO.
"The short term is that the temperature of U.S. IPO is still continuing; the mean is that China's company has more options, the Unit A, the Port Unit, the United States, and the reason why the United States and Central America will be elected as market choices and time options; it is a long time to see that everything will be restored to normal, that all market fluctuations will be cycled, that there will be political and economic cycles, that will eventually return to normal phase, that the city will be moving ahead."
"In this year, however, it is not more certain that the factors are comparable, but in the case of quality companies, whether the market is good and bad, whether it is real or can be seen by investors, other factors are relatively desirable and investors need better investment. "

People's Day commentators: focusing their own efforts on creating a new advantage for the future — while learning to follow up with the Deputy Director-General at a business conference -- Newway Network
New York Society, 25 July. People's Commentary article on 26 July: Focusing on their own efforts to create a new advantage for the future.
At the moment, the global epidemic and the world economy are still very complex, and our development challenges have not yet been met.
Maintaining strategic strength, strengthening confidence, and focusing on doing our own things is the key to our response to various risk challenges.
In a recent meeting of business households, it was recalled that in the context of current protectionism, the world's low economy and the external environment of global markets, we had to focus our efforts on improving our affairs, developing a fully-fledged domestic market advantage, gradually forming a new, inter-national, inter-national, inter-national development agency, promoting the modernization of the supply of industrial chains, significantly promoting technological innovation, speeding up key core technologies, and developing future new advantages.
The blind are wise, the deaf are defeated.
In the external environment of economic globalization, markets and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of my country.
Now, the world that is under attack is experiencing profound changes, facing more instability, factors that are uncertain, economic globalization is facing a turnaround and a turnaround.
A better time to prepare and prepare for ideas and work on external environmental change, to promote the deterioration of our economies, to be able to move our economies in the long run, and to move the world's economic recovery to expand and meet its internal needs as a strategic basis for development, and to take full advantage of its own advantages through the prosperous domestic economy.
We need to be fully aware of the need for a complete system of self-construction and relations between my country's long-term development and long-term security.
The central trial situation of the Party clearly presents a strong implementation of the internal needs strategy, which is the need to respond to the outbreak of infectious diseases, the need to maintain the long-term health development of our country, and the need to meet the needs of the people for a better life that is increasing.
The economic advantage of the great country is internally circular.
My country has the world's largest industrial system, the largest production capacity, the improved integration capacity, the availability of more than 10 billion market subjects and more than 1 7 billion people with advanced education or professional skills, as well as the large-scale market needs of more than 14 million people, including more than 4 billion middle-income groups, which are in the new type of industrialization, informationization, urbanization, the rapid development phase of modern agriculture, and the huge potential of investment needs.
Public administration is a topic, a multi-ethnic economic common development, a broad distribution of labour, a broad range of forms of distribution, a fundamental economic system of socialism, such as the socio-economic system of the social market economy, which can stimulate the effectiveness, liberation and development of the social production of different types of markets, and can contribute to efficient and equitable integration and continue to achieve common wealth.
We would like to put this strategic base in place within the context of expansion, production, distribution and dissemination, more and more depending on the positive cycle of the domestic market, and to provide a clear strategic direction for structural reform, to promote overall supply and demand balance at a higher level.
In order to speed up the internal needs of the whole system, to promote technological innovation and other innovations, to accelerate the development of the digital economy, to generate wisdom, to create new and strategic innovations such as life and new materials, to create a more new growth point, to make it a subject of growing growth and progressive development in the country as a whole, and to promote a new system of inter-national bilateral development.
Open up and make progress, and then close down.
The Deputy Prime Minister recalled several times that the gates opened in China would not be closed but would only expand.
It is not a matter of shutting the door to the functioning of the internal circle, but of enabling better communication between the internal market and the international market, and making better use of two international domestic markets and two resources to achieve better sustainable development.
At the same time, the expansion of internal needs and the expansion of openness is not contradictory, and the internal cycle is more flexible, more conducive to the establishment of an open new platform, and more conducive to the creation of an international cooperation and new competitive advantage.
While international protectionism is now growing, we need to stand on the right side of history, continue to deepen reform, expand open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy and promote the building of a community of human fate.
In the history of the Chinese people, there have been many hardships, but they have never been pressed, but they have been courageous, constantly growing in adversity and rising from oppression.
On the way forward, there is a strong leadership of the central, central and central parties, a strong advantage of China's special socialism system, a strong mobility capacity and a powerful integrated strength, a united struggle for the peoples of all nations of the Army, and we must be able to overcome all the obstacles to maintain our country's economic well-being, to build a whole and healthy society, and to successfully launch the new process of building a comprehensive modernization of socialism!
The rest of the money's been saved from "90" instead of "recovery"?
As long as the balance is earned, "90" is not just running away from the balance, but starts "recovery" saving money?
The "90 balance of cash report " (2020) published by the Institute of New Economics of China, published before the Christmas Day, showed that "90" was more popular in the last half of the year, and "90" was almost four percent higher than in the year 2019.
It's interesting to say that after 90, it's more likely to start falling from a "small" coin, where there's six percent of the average amount of each coin worth less than 20 dollars...
The rest of the money is expensive, and it's like "90."
Data show that among the remaining 7 billion users, 1.34 million users are "after 90".
China has $174 billion after 90, which means about three out of every four "90" in the country.
Currently, the 7-day annual income of the MMF is higher than 2 per cent from the start of the year, with a decrease of approximately 1.5 per cent.
Even so, it doesn't affect the pace of the '90s' after.
And in the context of the growth of the "money-generating effect" of the balance, a number of young people who used to use the balance of the balance are also transformed directly into "kids".
The payment of value data shows that as of 13 July, a new "kids" paid over a month is more than 1 times more than the increase, and more young people are increasingly able to achieve a "failure" phase.
There was an analysis that the financial flow from the balance sheet into the capital market was also an important reason for a clear decline in the share of the money fund in June.
The report also shows that "90" women are more inclined to spend more money than men and that they are twice as high as men; 6 of the users with funds on the pay-up platform are men, and women and men tend to choose a more stable financial approach.
After saving the money, what's the plan after "90"?
The payment of value data shows that "after 90" has the habit of making a target and making travel the most of the users of the currency target.
The impact of the vaccine was that many of the "90" money was prepared for post-mortem travel; the film industry was restored, and new ways were provided for the transfer of the money from the vaccine to consumption.

The Red Party flag is highly proud of the Hong Kong, free of any personal sacrifice, and is responsible for it.
In times of crisis, a member of the Party was shown to be at a time of serious threats to the lives of the people at the time of their lives, the Ministry of Defence, the Minority of the People ' s Army, taking into account all peoples, without dedication, and to be careful to fight against the threat of nuclear disaster, as a full-scale testing capacity, as a wind, as well as the threat of nuclear war, and access to such an indiscriminate and dangerous spirit, which greatly encouraged the confidence and determination of the people of the disaster to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism.

Professor Jong-in-Chief, Deputy Director of the Bloodless Section of the University of Mining Hospital, has been interviewed by the media.
The CSB is the first independent university in the province of Fouling, which has long been committed to the prevention of infectious diseases and outpatient diseases, and which has been approved in 2018 by the Section for the Construction of Rehabilitation at the Ministry's level.
In the area of initial treatment for infectious diseases, there is a wealth of experience in rapid depletion of infectious diseases, in addition to catalytic and active cirrhosis.
"The Section for Blood Transfusions of the University of Mining Hospitals from the history of development, the scope, difficulty, complexity, and many aspects such as surgery, is very complex in this region, so this time we create a collaborative centre, in addition to the motivations, can also work in medical, educational and scientific aspects of the treatment of diseases such as malaria. "

At the meeting, the journalists learned that blood transfusions were the first cause of death in China, that they were active as heads of the human organs, and that they played an important role from the heart to the heart.
The occurrence of active infectious diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and difficulty in treatment, and the most severe route to 4cm, when a blood clot is formed, or when it occurs, or when it is caused by a catalytic breakdown in the blood vessels, will cause a high risk of bleeding and very dangerous.
In recent years, as people change their way of life, their lifestyle has improved, China has become the first major countries in the world to have high blood pressure, and the disease has increased, and today, with the development of surgery and industrial materials, has become less and faster and more effective for the treatment of the disease.

At the meeting, journalists were aware that, with the development of operational technology and industrial materials, the treatment of infectious diseases is now under way to a small, rapid and effective approach to sustainable development.

2020-07-26 17:34:48 Source: China Newspapers Authors: Chung-Yong-Kong-Kong
A picture of a three-way construction site.
The Central Bank's group's design.
On 26 July, a new network reopened by 26 journalists from the China Railway Group was informed that about 189,000 square miles [18.9,000 sq km] of high-level triangular tunnels were crossed throughout the day.
It is understood that the triangular tunnels are not only the longest in the area of the three-storey districts, but also in the projects currently under construction in the country, which are designed to reach a maximum distance of 350 km/h.
Ten thousand high-powered areas in the South, North of Lakes, in three urban areas, in the north-west of China, in Beijing, Thailand, and in the south-west, are an important component of our country's high-speed and high-speed railways.
On the 26th day of the 26th, the entire line is crossed.
I'll take a picture of the scene.
There are thousands of high-powered cities in the province of Guangdong, in the south-west of the mountains, in the south-west, in the south-west, in the south-west, in the south-west, in the south-west, and in the south-west, and in the south-west, about 818 kilometres long and 350 km long, and in the heart of the country, and some 184 km deep.
Among them, the Ouija board has been operating for the first time on 1 December 2019, and the reconnaissance is increasing the progress of construction.
The 26-year-long triangular tunnel is a full-scale control project, located in the vicinity of the city, with a total of approximately 18.9 km long, with a maximum depth of 890 metres.
The station began its construction in February 2017 and runs on 26 July 2020.
According to a survey by the Project Group of the Chinese Bicycles Project in China, the Government of the Government of the Government of the Government of the United States of China has presented a very complex geographical situation in the location of small triangular tunnels, facing the risks of rock, sludge, high-risk tunnels, high-level design and construction.
"In the construction of the project, we are using spatial investigation law, overarching of objects and over-exploitation law, with a special design program for all sorts of holes in the remaining 30s. As designed to build a 24-foot bridge, cross the tunnels over 10 meters long, and a large hole over 55 meters away from the decline of the tunnel, the Royal Army says.
According to the factory's midway office, when the tunnel was built, it took a combination of tunnels to guide the tunnels through the construction of the wells, to raise the water level, to strengthen the structure of the tunnel and to build the water treatment station, to ensure the orderly progress of the project and to avoid damage to the water in the small areas of the triangular area, and to overcome the adverse conditions such as the long-distance of 7 km, with the highest volume of water rising up to 157,000 metres per day.
After the construction of thousands of high-powered railways, it will become our central destination in the south-western part of the country, and the new fast-speed road transport routes in the north-east region will be important for improving road skills and quality in the north-west region, improving the regional road network, speeding up the development of coastal resources and urbanization processes, and promoting regional coordination development and promoting the implementation of the West-West Development Strategy.
The expert said that through the United States Census of Populations, the collection of migration information for the distribution of seats for the public is a violation of the Constitution.
Several civil rights organizations and several United States cities and villages accused the United States Federal Government of attempting to eliminate migrants without proof that they were unconstitutional and unconstitutional.
The census of the population of the United States will decide to allocate the seat of the Assembly of the United States of America.
"It's impossible to do this. "
She then said that Tranop asked for the identification of the citizen who accepted the census in the census and that " it was not reliable. "
Another Civil Liberties Organization organized proceedings on Thursday, with a challenge to the Tranup administrative order.
In New Jersey, some cities in Georgia joined in the proceedings.
On Friday, Ahlton, Virginia, joined in the proceedings.
"The Constitution of the United States requires our people to be properly cleaned every 10 years. We must be able to clean up every person who lives in the city of Ahlton, so that such illegal attempts to frighten people and suppress our migrant communities can be prevented."
Other organizations and individuals commend President Tranop's administrative orders.
The Minister of Justice of Alabama said that the administrative order was a "winner" of the state.
He said, "When the seats of the National Assembly Hall and electoral missions in each state are divided, the number of inhabitants in each country must be based on the number of inhabitants and the number of persons who are legally resident. "
Last year, the Supreme Court of the United States of America had prevented the involvement of the Tranquil Administrative Authority in civil identity issues in the 2020 census.
Earlier this week, President Tranop signed an administrative order to regulate data from uncertified population data received by the Minister of Commerce of the United States Census Office to exclude these uncertified population census figures from all states, thus determining that each state would be either an increase or decrease or retain the seat of the House of Parliament.
Every 10 years, the United States has to relocate its seats in the House of Commons on the basis of population change.

Engines are the main forces of the South-South industry, but two-thirds of the combined enterprises are still in space and potential.

A thorough study of the research industry, the development industry, the development industry, the pursuit of a more efficient business environment will be able to win more investors' profits.
The front wind is gone, but the flow of winds has become an industrial project building throughout the province, leading to high-quality development.
This crucial period requires good study and careful follow-up to the critical guidelines of the General Assembly's series of reviews of the spirit, which will effectively address the uncertainty of its work on the external side, keep it in order to promote industrial projects, build together hot, dry water, and ensure "135" and fully build up a healthy society.

As an artist, communication is very important to me.
Through my art, I tried to explain that humans are not separate by nature, but that everything is interconnected.
About 10 years ago, I first went to South Asia, and I saw the ice.
I'm afraid.
My heart's moving fast, my head is shaking, trying to figure out what this is all about in front of me.
It's just a strange flower, covered in another snow, and it's a year-on-year-old.
The formation of the ice is when they break out of the ice or break out of the ice.
Every ice has their own unique characteristics.
They have a clear way of dealing with the environment around them and their circumstances.
Some ice-creams refuse to agree, and some ice-creams can't tolerate ice-creaming in a moment of intense tension.
When you see the ice, it's easy to think that they're all isolated, they're independent, unique, more like our human beings at times.
But the reality is far more than that.
As ice melts, I breathe into its old taste.
With the melting of ice, it released the pure water of mineral matter, and they fed everything.
I'm going to take pictures of these ice-creams, and it's like I'm taking pictures of my parents, and knowing that at these different times, the ice-creams exist in that way, but they're not going to exist any more.
It's not death when they're released, it's not death; it's not an end, it's a continuation of the path of immortality.
I took pictures of the ice, some of it was very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice, over a thousand years.
I'd like to show you the last picture I've ever seen on Kekertsutsak Island.
It's a very difficult opportunity for everyone to actually see a snowflake.
That's why it's like a picture.
You can see a small boat on the left.
It's a boat about 15 feet away.
I want you to be aware of the shape of the ice, the shape of it on the surface of the water.
Here you see it goes down, the little boat moves to the other side, and there's a man standing there.
It's a medium-sized Greenland ice.
It's about 120 feet high in the water or 40 feet in the water.
It's a real movie.
(Music) Like this mountain, they show everyone the different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.

"We hope that everyone will be more concerned about the future and help the feeding group," Juana said, "our dairy products will also be carefully selected and controlled in accordance with national standards, guaranteeing quality, while helping farmers to protect the rights of consumers. "
Since 22 July, there has been a continuous decline in rain, and since the 6th of July, the group of villages in the outlying areas of the Al-Qaida region has been rescinded from the mid-Biburg, which is a large-scale fluctuation, completely halting the flow of the river and forming 13 metres of pre-water, which is estimated to have a total of 550,000 square metres of water content.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the maritime sector has decided to implement temporary traffic control on the long-range rock surface and on the seabed.
The weather and water sectors are resuscitated and, from 25 days to 25 days, it rescinds in the north-west and north-east regions to the rain, some of the region's rain, and the earthquake.
There will be the highest water station on the 26th day of the year, and the highest water will be close to the protective water station.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the maritime sector has decided to implement temporary traffic control on long-range rock surfaces to the area of the sound waves. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the context of the review of urban defence and weather, water, water, and emergency business research, the Department of Urban Prevention of Drought has decided to publish advance warning information at river III and to launch emergency response response at the NIV level.
The Department of Urban Prevention calls for a high concern of rainwater conditions, in particular rainforests, hurricanes, tsunamis, tsunamis, tsunamis and tsunamis, and the threat of tsunamis, including the threat of floods, floods, tsunamis, flood change, advance analysis of the investigation, increased surveillance, determined the proliferation of hazardous populations in the region, timely mobilization of emergency relief teams and materials, and rapid disaster (risk) conditions, and avoid the occurrence of deaths.
The Minister of the Venetian Embassy in Lajua has given his advice and has participated in the priestly ceremony in the Association of the Old Vietnamese, the General Assembly of the People of Vietnam, the representative of the Government of China and the representative of the Old People ' s Association of the Old Age.
The Church of England is held in the atmosphere of the Great Wall, and representatives continue to smile at the British and praise the British for their success and for their greater special solidarity.
In his speech, the Minister's Counsellor stated that this was an opportunity to express his deep appreciation for the great sacrifice of freedom of the two countries of the former Viet Nam and the people of Laos, together with the opportunity to express appreciation for the great sacrifice of independence of both countries, as well as for the people of the two countries and to work together to combat the common enemy, to achieve national independence, national unity, to build a common country development, and to strengthen relations between the two countries.
On 23 January 1946, 74 years ago, 28 soldiers of the Old Tight Fight Union bravely sacrificed their lives at Ponehe point.
This step has been won as a historic victory for two countries in the initial phase of the struggle for the liberation of the peoples.
Ms. Xiao's heart stressed that the two peoples had always remembered that the British victims of the struggle for the liberation of the two nations were strong, while stressing that the younger generation of the two countries would continue to develop the old and strong tradition and contribute to the continued success of the old relationship and the prosperity of the two countries.

International Milan's 3,000-threatening Olympics - New Network
On July 26th, Beijing's 26th morning, the traditional international Melanie was at the time of the Olympics.
According to the Italian media statistics, the client's mission to Pothona is to be the 3,000th anniversary of the International Military History, and the Blue Army is also the first to launch this series of games.
Since the re-establishment of the League in 1929, Milan has been the only unintended team in the world, and the only one in the world has never been downgraded.
According to the Italian media, the international battle between Milan and Tunisia was the 3,000th in the history of the Black Army.
In the course of this campaign, the three international Milan clients won the Henana War.
This service opens twice, and Sanchez is also contributing to the replacement.
From the beginning, the game has entered the international show in Milan, and the attack has finally turned into a ball in the 34th minute.
On the left side of the street of Belgium, the streets of Lukakaku broke the door.
In the 82-minute international Milan, like the law enforcement, in the post-Muslim crossing of Sanchez, the train in Sanchez, completed the second half of the course of the terminal, was sent out from Brussels to direct, and Lucas entered the area to launch an empty door after Romero, which would be separated from the definition at 3:0.
The International Mian client 3:0 has won Henana and has joined the Sustenance Summit to the Second, and after the fall of a multi-stakeholder leader Yuvantus 4 points remain in line with the hopes of the contest.
In addition, in the 3,000-square-square-square-square, the international Milan won 1489 of them, reaching 834 and losing 677, with 49.6 per cent winning.
In the middle, the ball hits 5038, it breaks 3102, it's going to 1.68.
The Blue Army has gained 18 league championships and has never been down.
It was said that this unmanaged machine was in the country when the mission was carried out near the "Blood Line" between Israel and Lebanon.
The declaration does not mention the reasons for the failure of the unmanned aircraft.
An Israeli media report says that this unmanaged aircraft may have fallen into disaster.
It was reported that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence of Israel, Gantz, had indicated that on the afternoon of the visit to the northern region of Israel, Israel would continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long viewed the Lebanese People ' s Party as a major security threat and has accused Iran of sending weapons to the Lebanese People ' s Party through the Syrian territory, in the context of the situation near the border.
Israel has fought the organization several times and has launched an air attack on the targets in Syria.

The show described the joint sub-political agents of the Southern Police Department, Mr. Donton (Jongwon), who killed Japan's chief officer and broke the Japanese army's surprises.
"Victory" is based on the fact that the material is taken from the Soviet military archives that have been blocked for years.
During the Mosco War, the Soviet Union continued to support the East Coast, while the Japanese army "Northern Progress" felt that there was an opportunity and a desire for the military.
In order to address the threat of hate, the Modán Ura plan was implemented jointly with Soviet intelligence personnel.
On the basis of this historical background, known as the drafting of the originals of torture and the burning of the body.
Zhaoong is the head of control and man at the same time in the "Victory".
In his play, he was the Chief Criminal Section of the Lingala Police Office, a happy, even a bit jealous of the Taliban police, and a true figure was a member of the community.
The women's main dream of the play is the head of the Lingala Security Agency, who has deep appreciation for the blessings of the Japanese Division, and who have an inexhaustible relationship with the Dongs.
Su has tried many different types of roles in recent years, and from those "we're young" to the "intentions" of the "intentions" in the field, there's a deep impression on the audience and the art is recognized.
This was the first time the Soo-Oo-Oo-Oo-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O
In addition to the two main corners, "winnings" include the playwrights, the Leighs, the Money, the Reahams, and many powerful players, such as the Army, and the old-fashioned actors, as well as the playoffs.
It is understood that the "winning" is also a very good thing, that the team has crossed the bridge, and that it's a little bit more than 2,000 miles from the province of Maine.
In order to re-enter cities in the eastern part of the Middle East, a team of U.S. industry was working at night, carefully researching the sights and every detail of the building and furnishings, making the film of the medieval scene more attractive and historic.
The earthquake in the two provinces of West Yemen led to the death of 16 people -- a new network in Yemen
The news from Sanaan, New York City, on July 26, reports that on the 26th day of Yemen's local media, there was a strong floods in East India and Haj Province, which killed at least 16 people in 48 hours.
It is reported that 13 people died from floods caused by the floods in the Netherlands, and three people in the nearby Haje province died in the floods.
In addition, dozens of houses in the northern part of the Netherlands and in the southern part of the Haj area were destroyed and some roads and farms were also damaged.
The continued military conflicts have caused a close breakdown in Yemen's health system.
Statistics from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs indicated that since 2017, Yemen has infected more than 1 million people and more than 2000 people have died.
Yemen's medical institutions are concerned that persistent floods will result in a resurgence of hospice.
"Tomorrow attack" shows the life of the New Warships.
The film's "absolutely hit" is officially featured in Ecky's online film, led by the youth's high-ranking coach, William, the East, and the Prince's.
The video told stories of the fall of the Emperor Vinas and the battle for dignity and honor, showing a period of bloody vengeful despair.
The film "extremely" has been promoted by Thailand as the starting point of the Song of Solomon's Falling King Vinas' dream, and the whole story has been carried out in an amendment to traditional Chinese cultural values, whether the determination to lie to his father for his father, or the subsequent efforts to rejuvenate him as a noble warrior in support of his friends and loved ones, both of the men in the traditional Chinese culture have shown great love for his family and his dreams.
In line with the classic Galway Films and the strong team of professional groups in both Central and Central Thailand, the "absolute" will not only reveal the effect of internationalization, but will also stimulate different types of audiences.
At the same time, the "absolutely hit" shows the dramaticness of thievery and training, the intense and hot blood in the face.
In the video, a small game designer from the east-eastered game designers, who used the game to help Vinas, who was replayed by William, re-entered into the theater and removed the scene of a new fascinating high-tech and hot-blooded competition, also showed a small and white-eyed brotherly affection that looked like "a different way", the real goal.
In addition, the deep love between Venus and Creole is also very impressive, and the silence of Venus has always been supported and the firm commitment of Venus to the Creole has been made to see the "Hungaryness" on Venus, and many people have added their feelings to it.

Initiate App violations of personal information management through the new network
2020-07-26 15:18:27 Source: Central TV, author: Jún-zún, Editor of the responsibility: Jún-
Launching the App in violation of personal information management.
The National Committee for Standardization of Information Security, China Consumer Association, China Internet Association, China Network Space Security Association, and relevant professional assessment bodies participated in the meeting.
App used the micro-communication of personal information collection (“App Personal Information Notice”), two specific channels (pip.tc260.org.cn) for violations of the privacy management working group, reflecting the guidance and issues of the broad-based network on the abuse of personal information.
At the same time, large-scale netizens can report and reflect illegal acts on platforms such as the Centre for Infringement and Bad Information (www.12377.cn).
General, the journalist.
Open a new round of exchanges, transfer of 17.5 per cent of the capital to the overseas countries -- the economic observation network -- professional finance through the news website.
On 26 July, the Journalist, the Green Control Unit (6006.SH) published "a notice notice of the transfer of the part of the company's shares by the State-owned shares to the public by way of public collection of assignees".
The content of the press shows that, for further deepening the country's financial perspectives, the optimisation of the State-based structure, the improvement of the structure of the Green Group, the limited company in Haiti (hereinafter referred to as the " Upper Haiti ") and the limited company in the Upper Sea (hereinafter " the " Upper Sea Towns") are intended to transfer the shares held by public collecting the assignees and not more than 17.5 per cent of the total of the Green Stocks.
The cost of this proposed transfer of shares is not lower than those of the two: the average average value of the daily average price of the 30 trading days prior to the notice day (20 July 2020) and each net asset audited by a recent accounting company.
At present, new strategic investors in the land remain undisputed and, according to public information estimates, the new strategic investors are required to pay some $11.5 per cent of the shares transferred from the Green Exchange.
It is worth noting that after the transfer of this component, it is expected that none of the entity's shareholders and actual controllers remain outside the green area, but more changes in the control structure may occur.
Since the establishment of the Green Control Unit, several institutional mechanisms have been reformed: 1992-1997, run under the rules of marketing in pure countries; in 1997-2013, the establishment of and continued improvement of the national control units, the division of the employment units; in 2013-2015, the introduction of strategic investors, the formation of non-public capital transfers units, and the combined arrangements for each other; and in 2015 to date, the entire city is becoming a public company.
The current GHG is similar to the GHG, and in December 2019, the GHG has been implementing a high-strength project with a capacity of 416.62 million hand-held powered power plants (000651.SZ) 15 per cent of its share power, and the GHG is relocated to small components, after which the GHG has completed.
In the case of Haiti, the capital injections to the Group of National Enterprises, which has been fully funded by the MFIs, and the Chairman of the Green Controls Unit, the President-in-Office said that the Green Sea, in accordance with the central demands of the party, promotes the integrated reform of the country's MFIs, speeded up the important initiatives of a new phase of the country's financial capital reform, demonstrated the full impact of the new ideas for the construction of the mass-restraints, introduced new strategic components of the MFIs, and supported companies to further improve their marketization, increase their freedom of business management, and speeding up their overall release.
Cross-professional return.
On 25 July, at 1220 hours on 25 July (New Yorker Leap), 200 passengers on board the D771 motor vehicle were successfully arriving in the city of Lingala, which was also the first cross-country travel district in the country since the fall of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on 14 July.
There are many popular sights, such as the town of Lannan, in the Middle East, in the region, and in the region, where 200 seafarers will guide one of these sights in two days.
Lilly, Deputy Director-General of the International Railways (Group) Limited, said that the company was not sending products for a week, in line with the latest policy, to cross-country travel needs, for the first time in contact with the city of Lancao, and for the careful promotion of "On the Sea of the Sea" and "On the second day of summer" products.
The Grandmother from the sea said that because of the plague, this year there was no door.
"It's been a long time at home, seeing a crowd of people, and immediately sharing the news with friends, never come to London before, so much waiting for this trip."
It is understood that last September, the project cooperation agreement with the international travel company (group) on the upper sea railways was concluded with the plan to launch 12 high-level travel projects in the West Bank in one year.
Do I face myself?
The U.S. White House Adviser has been rehabilitated early in the state.
The U.S. White House Adviser has been rehabilitating all states.
On 23 July local time, the number of cases of new cancer in the United States fell by 40 million, representing 30 per cent of global disease.
In the months following the month, President Trannon repeatedly called for the restoration of state-owned rehabilitations, and until the day of the change in attitudes, the initiative was in public custody, and his consultants were more "restraint" than were used to rehabilitate some state governments.
On 22 May, the Council of Presidents, Mr. Kalian Conway, said at the press conference that some government governments had not complied with the redundancies and had recently reopened a place like the bar.
Conway also pointed out that the previous statement on the President's "exclusive power" was a false statement of the State's remand.
"The President is a federalist, he believes that all states have sovereignty."
She's protesting for the Tranquil.
However, the "apocalypse" in Conway was spoken by Tranup on April 13th at the White Civic News.
This is the most self-defense action that the netizens call "record history".
Karen Conway wants to write history. She's a liar.
Trannon is generally known as the governor of the state of Michigan, Grayon Whitmore, as she adhered to the medical guidelines and kept her job.
Tranquil wants to promote the rehabilitation, so he can hold meetings.
This isn't the first time that Karen Conway has been arguing.
On 15 April, when the Fox News received an interview, Konwei released: "This is COVID-19, and not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to understand "19" as a version, and the netizens are crazy: they don't know how to read the paper!
Recently, we've seen the impact of a network attack on the business world.
Like Morgan's general, Jai, the family's wealth and the cash of these companies, led to the loss of billions of dollars and even billions of dollars.
Again and again, the whole world economy will collapse.
There is no way to escape from public areas.
From 2012 to 2014, the U.S. Office of Human Management revealed very serious data.
Security licenses and fingerprints have been stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard that some government-funded blackouts, trying to steal data, affect the big election results of some countries.
In the last two cases, together with large amounts of data from the Federal Assembly of Germany, together with the National Committee of the Democratic Party of the United States of America, e-mails.
The network threats have affected our democratic process.
And there's a strong trend.
The more computer technology is developed, the more vulnerable we use to protect data.
In particular, a new computer technology, called a machine computer, it uses the microchip of the natural environment to significantly increase the operating capacity of the computer.
Its operational capacity is strong enough to break the many encryption systems we use today.
So we have no hope?
Should we start gathering electronic living equipment to come to the end of the coming day?
I don't think it's yet.
The computer is still in the lab, and it takes a few years to get rid of actual use.
More importantly, there have been many major conflicts in the encryption area.
For me, it's a very exciting time in the history of security communications.
About 15 years ago, I realized that we had to unlock new skills that could create quantifiable effects that would not exist.
Using the basic laws of physics to promote the expansion of technology, this idea no longer motivates me.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have advanced this technology to the stage of actual application.
That's right.
We're going to use the measure against the measure.
How's it going to work?
First of all, let's quickly understand the classified world.
You need a wallet, you have some important documents to send to your good friend James Bond, lock it up, secure it.
Because these materials are the best secret, we're going to use a super-progress package.
It has a special password lock, and once it's locked, it's going to convert the contents of the document into a random number.
So you just put the document in, lock it, this time the document has been converted into a serial number, you're sending this leaflet to James.
You call him when he's not here.
Once he gets a copy, enter the password, complete the document, and complete it, perfect, you've been able to pass a encrypted message to James Bond.
(Laughter) It's an interesting example, but it's a three-point point.
Password -- we call it a encryption key.
You can imagine it as a password.
Tell James's phone.
We call it a secret.
It assures us that we can send the security of the key to the designated location.
And the key to encrypted documents.
We call it a code of secrecy.
Through the key, it transforms the contents of the document into a random number.
A good bill can do this, and it's hard to break the password without the key.
The importance of the bill is that if someone gets a copy of it, opens it, no secret, no encryption, they can't read the contents of the document.
It's just a few sequences.
Most of the security systems depend on the safe means of conveying the secret to the right place.
However, the ability to calculate fast growth has threatened the many ways we are using.
For example, we're now applying a very wide system -- RSA.
When it was discovered in 1977, it took some 4 million years to break down a 426 RSA secret.
And by 1994, just 17 years ago, this code was broken.
As computers become more and more powerful, the password we need is increasing.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096 passwords.
As you can see, the struggle between the secretaries and the secretaries is under way, and they want to win.
In the next 10 to 15 years, when the computer comes, it's going to break more complicated mathematical calculations, which are the basis of the encryption system we use today.
Actually, the computer's going to turn our safe city into a closet.
We're trying to protect our castle.
In recent years there have been a number of research institutions, and research on how to use quantify effects to strengthen them.
People's got some exciting crashs.
Remember three secrets that were encrypted, high quality secret, safe secret transmission, and very strong logic.
However, scientific and engineering progress has been at risk for two of them.
First of all, it's the key.
Computer numbers are the foundation of the secret.
But by today, they're no longer a real match.
Now, we're born into a secret, based on the digital frequency of computers, based on software, we call it a random number.
The number of procedures or mathematical methods, there will always be some, maybe not so clear rules in there.
The sequence of these numbers, or the terms of the term, including the letters, is going to be easier to predict.
In recent times, some gambling sites have been attacked, and the way they are attacked is very creative.
They took a little time to take a picture of the machine, and then analyze it.
Network offenders, using reverse engineering, produce a reverse-reversible computer generator.
This is how they're going to have a lot of rates, predicting the transformation, so they're going to make a lot of money.
The secret is not safe either.
It's important to have a real serial number generator for producing a password that's safe.
For years, researchers have been trying to create a real digital generator.
But most of the design, whether it's not enough or not, it's not fast or it's hard to re-use.
But the world of mass is a real match.
The use of this true traceability is very important.
A device that can measure quantify the effect can become very rapidly and continuously quantified.
The crime just mentioned is not possible anymore.
The number of universities and companies from all over the world is in the center of the production of real satellite digital generators.
In my company, our computer computer generator was born in a 2-metre 1-metre lighthouse.
Then we cut it to a box size.
To date, you can put it on a PCI card, insert it on a common computer.
It's the fastest in the world. It's a really convenient digital generator.
It can produce 100 billion sequences per second by measuring the quantification effect.
Today it has been widely used throughout the world to promote the security of suppliers, banks and government agencies.
(Applause) But even if there's a real computer computer generator, we're also facing the second major network security threat: that's the security transmission problem.
The current secret transfer technology is not able to counter the computer.
And to this issue, the quantification program, called the distribution of the quantification key, called QKD, has used a basic anti-semitic nature.
Watching the microchip, it'll change the angle.
I'll give you an example.
Let's go back and think about it. We're going to give James Bond the password.
But this time, we don't call him, we're using quantified effects, carrying this password, sending James through the ordinary light bulb.
We assume Dr. Sinno wants this password.
Luckily, Dr. Noe's trying to capture this amount of secret will be left with an electronic fingerprint, James and you will notice.
That's what's going on.
And the rest of the secret can provide great protection for data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the basic principles of physics, the amount of computers, or any future supercomputer, it can't be broken.
I'm working with my team, along with many top universities and the defence sector, to improve this exciting technology, to develop the next generation of security products.
A high interconnection period was predicted, expected to have 250-300 million Internet access equipment by 2020.
If our society is to function normally in the Internet, then the trust of these interconnected systems is crucial.
We believe quantification technology is very important to build this trust, it will ensure that we enjoy these wonderful innovations, enjoy these that make our lives rich and rich.
Thank you, everyone.

Is there any reason to argue again after being charged at 3-year-old school?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Day of the Day of Law Authors: King of Human Rights Editor: King of Human Rights
The scene was broken. After the kid was taken to the school, he was charged again.
□ Reporter, General
A 3-year-old boy who played at a university-run game accidentally hit his head when he was played by a football team.
After a claim was made, Mr. Wynn, as a legal representative of the minority, appealed to the court for a complaint against the school's claim in the place of execution, and paid medical costs, such as psychological damage to the pension.
In the near future, the People ' s Court of the Sea of Beijing held that the school had set up a protection network in the context of the case and had fulfilled its proper security obligations and had been repared by someone who had appealed to the complainant on the basis of the judgement.
Mr. Wynn complained that during the summer of 2019, he had a small boy playing at school, and at the time the football team was training.
In order to avoid the risks posed by this, young people, Mr. Wynn and many other young friends and parents are active in the security regions designated by the football team.
But then the football team said it was going to get off the ball, and it led to the passage of the ball into the security area and hit the middle of the head.
Mr. Wynn immediately went to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed as a headache.
Mr. Wynn felt that the facilities of the school ballpoint did not comply with the relevant security provisions and did not effectively manage the team and the related facilities.
The failure of the school led to the above events, causing great pain to the minority and also caused greater suffering to his family, which should be the legal responsibility of the school.
In this regard, the school argues that schools have already set up a security network at the disposal of the operating system and have imposed administrative provisions, training, notification of access to the premises to maintain safety distance with training sites and alerts to their own security, and the prosecutor cannot prove that the school's "non-safety obligations are not met", so he disagrees with the compensation.
The Court considered that the location of the case involved an open location for the public, although the school had a security obligation to manage the operation, but that security obligations had only to be met with general attention.
In the course of the course, schools have established a network of protection and have fulfilled the appropriate security obligations, and some have been reimbursed to minors in accordance with the above-mentioned compensation agreement, with two thousand dollars of losses, such as transport costs, which both parties agreed to resolve once.
After the case, the Chief of the Minority has again claimed compensation for school and, if possible, the Court has ruled that all complaints against the complainant have been rejected.
Both parties have not appealed, and the judgement has entered into force.
In accordance with article 37 of the Act on the Immunities of my State, schools as administrators in public places have a security obligation; in the event of damage caused by third parties, third parties are liable for violations, but not to the extent possible, the public administration of the security obligation should assume the corresponding responsibilities.
The judge stated that, as a public-sector manager, the most possible knowledge of the actual situation in the area was about the risks and damages that might occur, and thus the most possible measures could be taken to prevent or mitigate the damage and avoid the minimum cost of damages, so that the law provided for the obligation to ensure that they were engaged in social activities.
In the present case, in respect of non-specific entry into the public-free operation, the school-based security obligations should be adapted to the social activities it operates, and in particular, the basic security measures should be taken and the obligation to inform the public about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is also not necessary to impose too high security obligations on public administrations.
If schools have already adopted a network of protection and have complied with their reporting obligations, it can be determined that the school is not in error and that there is no legal responsibility.
In addition, in respect of the third party ' s violations, even if public administrations such as schools have failed to meet their security obligations, their responsibility is also as a supplement to compensation for damages and, in accordance with the most recent civil law, the administrator may be reimbursed to the third party.
In such a case, the victim should no longer extend the scope of the claim after the victim has received the compensation of the direct offender.
Today I want to show you how we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our building and machinery will be able to organize itself, self-recovery and self-recovery.
So I'm going to show you the current situation in the manufacturing industry that I think is, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have a building of the moon for two and a half years, up to as many as 500,000 million, very complex, using new technologies in iron, copper, and lead.
We have a moving machine that can bring us into space -- five hours, two hundred and fifty million pieces.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million kinds of protein that can break in a thousand seconds, we can repeat DNA with about one hour.
It's the complexity of our natural systems, but they're very efficient, they're more efficient than anything we've created, and they're more complex than anything we can create.
They are more efficient in energy.
They're a very small mistake.
They'll be able to rebuild themselves.
There are things that are extremely interesting about the natural system.
If we can convert it into our building environment, then the way we build things will have a lot of potential.
I think the key is self-assessment.
If we want to use self-assessment in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
First of all, we need to figure out all the complexity of what we're building -- that's our building and machine.
We need to define them as a simple order -- basically our building's DNA.
And then we need the part that we need to plan, this part can accept this order and be used to break or break.
We need some energy to activate, so that our parts can be broken down according to the procedure.
We need some sort of sort of bug solution to ensure that what we've built successfully is what we want.
So, I'm going to show you some of the projects that I and my colleagues are doing to achieve the future of this self-organization.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale restructurers — 8 meters and 12 feet of protein.
They're plugging in the computer, transmitter.
You need to decodify the way you want to break up, make a series of angles -- 120 degrees, 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, 120 degrees -- things like this; a series of angles, or shifts, can switch this order over.
Each unit has its own message -- for example, it rotates 120.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working for this project.
I believe that this item is really revealing: is it really possible to expand?
I mean, it's worth thousands of dollars a lot of people to make this eight-foot machine.
Can we really expand it?
The next problem is to look at mobility, or try to make regroupable.
But it's going further, it's trying to actually calculate.
It's essentially incorporated most of the infrastructure modules, digital logic doors, directly into various parts.
It's with the door.
Each door for calculation has one fourth, two entrances in four.
One of them comes from the user's input, just like you're building a hole.
The other one is the entrance of a well-placed band before it comes.
And then it's going to give the exit of the three-way space.
This means the user is building a shell in the way they want it.
It's based on what it's done before and on your orders.
Now it's starting to move in three-way space -- up or down.
See left, [1,1] input is equal to 0 output, indicating below.
The entry at the right, [0.0] is a output, indicating up.
So this real meaning is that our structure now includes the blues we want to build.
Thus, information on what you want to build has been fully included in it.
This means we have some kind of self-copying.
In this case, I call myself a copy because your structure contains a precise blue picture.
If there's a mistake, you can replace a part.
All local information is included in it, telling you how to fix it.
So you've got something you can do, read it and one output.
It is directly embedded; there is no external command entry.
The last project name I'm going to show is a top-case link, which might be the most exciting example we've ever seen in the self-repaired system.
It has a reversible and structured system that makes it a fully motivated system.
It's basically the element you've got a line.
Every element is exactly the same, and they're different.
Every chain, or each element wants to turn to the right or to the left.
If you're going to wear a tie, you need to plan for it.
To tell each unit to turn left or right.
When you move this chain, it breaks into any structure that you're coded for -- so in this case, a circle, a fire like this, two interconnected bodies.
Basically, you can schedule in three spaces -- or one, two -- this link is fully activated.
What does this tell us about the future?
I think this tells us that these are in our body structure, in our building and in our machines, the possibility of self-recovery and self-recovery.
There are new organizational features in these sections.
You can get a new possibility from there.
We'll have space calculations.
Imagine our building, bridge, machine, and all the holes can actually be calculated.
How amazing and estimating and disseminating computing capabilities and new design possibilities.
It's an exciting potential.
I think these projects I've shown to all are just a small step forward, if we achieve these new technologies for a new world of self-organization.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Under the control of the immune system, people's enthusiasm for their health is high.
With the gradual release of the cross-professional tourism operation, the tourism market will also be restored.
Since 21 July, the provinces have resumed the cross-professional tourism operation, and the first weekend after the opening came as a guesthouse for the purpose of the tour.
As a tourist destination for Hot May, many visitors arrived on the weekend.
The railway station is expected to send 3700,000 passengers to the airport, with students, tourists, and visitors.
In July, the tourism market was slowed down, and 440 flights were conducted every day, and 80 per cent of the domestic flights were restored before the vaccination.
Air carriers have signed doors to the upper sea, Beijing, Chunging, and the Central City's airway, such as the West Bank, and have taken over after-suspend travel markets.
At present, a number of cross-country cross-country travel products are part of a multi-trading travel society that is mainly dominated by the team's external points.
At the train station, the airfield airfields are high, the relevant units are at a value-added airport, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the development of an improved "8-related health code" in order to achieve the sharing and mutual recognition of health data between 31 provinces and promote a orderly recovery of the tourism market.
"Do you know how to break out of the new-new-wave network?"
"Expert 2" will be announced on December 24th as a video that will be recorded as the top of the old archive.
The second is still the lead of the philanthropist, the Watch Tower and the President, and the whole new story.
It was reported that the accession of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second century also made the challenges of this bomb expert more difficult, predicting some of the horrors of a single mirror, a heart attack, a massive explosion of lightning, a fire-fighting airport, and a rather alarming situation.
Three years ago, the "disarmed expert" of the former Marika was awarded the five-room championships of the year and received seven nominations in Hong Kong Film Awards, as well as gold medals in the eyes of the audience.
This "Dublin 2" expert is also re-expected to see if it can wipe out a new flame for the king's team.
"Expert 2" told a whole new story: the former bomb expert stormer (Wideway) fell in the scene of the explosion and was listed as suspects by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to seek the help of a good friend of the bomb expert.
The women's inspectors were quickly involved in the case, and were also included in the case of a pre-war girlfriend.
It is still an expert on explosives, but it is possible to experience the complex role of the Dwarves: cut off the leg, put on the shoulder, and chased away by the bomb expert, and ordered action by former girlfriends.
What was the relationship between the three of them, what was he doing at the hotel in Hong Kong, what kind of job did he do, what kind of job did he break into, and what kind of job did he experience?
It is understood that the film's main role is the world-wide landmark building in Hong Kong, as well as the top-up special production team, which has led to a real visual explosion.

On 26 July, the Inter-Russian Satellite Network reported that on 26 July it was the day of the Russian Navy and that the main day of the Navy's arrival took place in St. Petersburg and Cassau City.
President Russia, the Russian Federation's highest military force reached Beijing City, where 15 ships and submarines were applied for.
On 28 July 2019, the local time was held in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It was reported that Beijing celebrated the Marine Army Day with a small boat on the side of the ship that was to be admitted to the Navy in Finland and was subsequently visited by troops at the headquarters.
Putin indicated that the Russian army had included the latest ships and special equipment and that the equipment level had been increasing.
Putin, in his military service at the Russian Navy, said: "The Russian Navy has a high-strengthened army, strategic submarines and multi-purpose submarines, modern aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment. "
On 24 June local time, Russia celebrated the victory of the National War in the Red Cross for the 75th anniversary of the victory.
He also indicated that the Russian army would have a unique advantage based on digitalization and effective means of defence.
It is reported that the main maritime forces of the Russian Navy were held in St. Petersburg and Cassetted, where 46 ships participated, including the "Casatonovs", the "Curakovs" in the "Curakovs", and the Great Islanders, the Small Missiles, the Guards, and the Patriots.
The series of ships were held in silence at the bridge of St. Petersburg, where the most impressive goal was to be the first Russian warship "Poltava" in the 18th century.
In order to avoid the spread of new vaccines, only local residents and special guests can enter Khartoum City during this year's military service.
The last Sunday of July each year is the Russian Navy Day.
Beckin's New Year's Eve's Day, 86-year-old.
On 26 July, the Beijing Music Group announced the announcement of the Beijing Music Group, the founder of Beijing Music Group, the famous Chinese commander, the music educator, the life-study member of the Central Music School, the year of the school of professors, the disability of the medical profession, and the death of Beijing at 1355 on 26 July 2020 at 86 years of age.
Photo from the Beijing Association of Music.
He was born in 1934, the son of Seung Kyung, from his early childhood in love.
In 1951, the South China People's Radio Radio Team Command, which was reviewed in 1951 by the Great Music System of the East Sea Masters, was reviewed by Professor Huang and the German Commander Hizman's instruction, and retrained the course for former Soviet expert Alzamanov.
In 1958, he was taught at the Beijing Academy of Artists' Music, and in 1973 he became a song director at the Central Music School.
In July 1983, the Beijing Association of Music was created.
For the past 30 years, he has embraced the purpose of "love and dedication" and has led this group to sing around the world, and has won several prizes in the most important games in the country.
In the past, the Central Music Group, the Central People's Dance Group, the Eastern Music Group, and the 30 other groups, such as the upper Sea Music Group, were held in a multi-stakeholder concert and a combination of music.
The books are "School Training", "School Training", "Song Two", "Singing" and "Singing" and "Singing" and the paper "Singing" and "Singing" on the music levels, as well as "Singer Law" and "Denglish and Voting languages".
Do you know how many plants?
There are 250,000 species -- at least we know there are so many -- 250,000 plants.
And flowers are a problem.
It's really hard for plants to grow.
A great deal of experience and many resources are needed.
Why would it bother you so much?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
There are so important reasons for sexual reproduction -- there are many other ways that plants can reproduce.
It can be used in an integrated way; it can be a gender-based breeding; it can be co-infected.
But they really need to distribute their genes in combination with other genes, so they can have an ecological environment.
That's how growth works.
The way in which plants transmit this information is now through flowers.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a way to see these scans.
How many plants have different kinds of flowers.
It's really useful for legal medicine and medicine.
Most of them will cause us to suffer from the fluffy flowers that come from the winds and spread the plants that are very low in efficiency, and that's why they always run into our nose.
Because most of them have been abandoned, hoping to include the reproductive cells in the flower, the hormonal reproductive cells, will fall into another flower.
All the trees, that means all the hills, and most of the trees, scattered by wind.
But most of the species actually use insects to complete this process, it's smarter to some extent, because it doesn't need a lot of flowers.
The insects and other species can carry flowers, move them directly to where they need them.
Clearly, we note the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a common relationship, whether it's a bird or a bear, they can all get a return, and usually a return is a flower.
This community relationship sometimes leads to a remarkable adaptation -- a beautiful adaptation of the Red Cross.
Plants have also been acquired, and the sky has spread the flowers elsewhere.
Plant growth, where it creates a tunnel, the honey may be lost.
Many plants look like other insects.
These are hundreds of flowers, very beautiful, so when an unknown insect falls at its top, it turns around with a lot of flowers and hits the back of it, so it can follow the insects to other plants.
There's a flower that looks like there's a common flower. At some point it says it's true; it's forced to pop up, it's raining, and it's bringing flowers to other places.
And there are at least 2 000 oranges -- a variety of surprises.
They have a variety of flowers.
They have to try and attract fans to help them complete this process.
It's called Darwin's flower, because it's been studied by Darwin, and when he sees it, he's given a wonderful prediction.
The basic thing to do is -- when we come to the flower -- it's inverted in the middle of the middle part of the tree to get the flowers.
Darwin said, look at this flower, "I guess there's something going on together with it."
There's no question, it's insects.
When I mean, it's usually full, but after it's extended, it looks like it.
Now you can imagine that if flowers such as these valuable things are high prices for plants and can attract a lot of fungi, then, like in human behavior, people may start to deceive each other.
They might say, "I have some flowers.
It's a plant.
These plants, which they like about the insects in South Africa, have developed a long-term oral system to get the fruit from the bottom.
It's a model.
This plant is a plant before the simulation.
There's a long mouthpiece that doesn't get any flowers from a liar, because a liar doesn't give it any flowers, it thinks it can.
So, no, but no flowers from a false plant, and -- if you're very close to the top of your head, you'll see some flowers there, they'll be spread to other plants, if there's no farmer coming, and they'll put it on a blue card.
(Laughter) Such lies spread across the whole kingdom of plants.
This flower with black spots: they may look like we're black spots, but I'm telling you, for the right kind of horoscopes, it looks like two very very sexy sensitivities.
(Laughter) When the insects arrive and go up to the ground, they will, of course, be taken to other plants, and if you see that every family should have an image of an electron-significant microscope, you can actually see some of the pictures there, three-square.
It even makes you feel comfortable, looks good.
These electrons appear to be a micro-smoker -- that's a flower that's lying on a planet -- you can see for our eyes that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and that insects may feel very different.
It's a form of metallic light that has been seen on a few microchips.
You can see this face -- it's very different from the other faces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant models into a insect, even if we look like it.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or animal.
It's beautiful and amazing.
It's the smart part of it, it's called black rock.
I think it's kind of weird sometimes.
For a suitable type of honey, it looks like another very aggressive honey, it'll fly through and hit it many times and try to get it off, of course, it'll get it to the flower.
The other thing it does is this plant model becomes another flower of the rich, delicious food.
But there's nothing.
So it's cheating on both sides -- it's hard to believe.
(Laughter) What we saw was an Irish, a part of the intense taste.
I actually felt it before.
These flowers don't really need to be so beautiful.
They spread wonderful flavors, attracting any interesting insects.
It doesn't smell like that.
This flower, it actually feels really bad, and once again, it's evolution, it looks like it's corrosive.
That's why he likes it.
He's gonna fly in and help him learn.
This is the White Sea, also known as the Dead Sea.
I don't know what it smells like to die, but this flower may look very much like.
It's really scary.
Green hair doesn't stop.
Get in there, get in there.
On the top of the plant, I think it's a good piece of meat, and it doesn't know that there's no food here, but it's going to die here, but at the same time, it's going to be useful, because it's hard to clean up, it's lost, and it's going to rain to another flower -- it's amazing.
It's a marine plant, the European Sea, the Yao Yau Yao, in this country called herb.
I took this photo last week at Tossette.
This guy's temperature is about 15 degrees higher than the environment.
If you look at it inside, it's a little bit like a big thing, and it's hot -- it's a kind of fungic chemical substance -- they're stuck under this container.
They're having sweet flowers, and then they're getting a little confused.
In the night, they were covered with flowers, under their wings, and then we saw the hard hair on the top, and it turned out that these little insects were able to escape -- it's hard to believe.
If you think it's incredible, it's one of my favorites.
It's spring green.
Those who come from Brazil should know that plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
It's about a mile long.
It has a capacity that I know does not have any other plants, when it spreads -- it's in the middle of the flesh -- about two days, it's produced some kind of kind of kind of antagonism, some kind of anemone.
And there's no fat, it's food for plants, it's got a lot of color-like fats to burn it at the speed of the fat, burn it, thank you, about a cat's speed.
By weight, it's a bird's energy output twice -- absolutely amazing.
It's done something unusual.
Not only will it warm up to 155 degrees, 43 or 44 degrees, two days, and it will remain warm.
There's a temperature adjustment mechanism to keep warm.
Why would you do that?
Now you don't know, some bacteria like to share this temperature.
They're in, they're full of flowers.
(Laughter) Plants pour flowers on them, let them go and teach them.
It's so weird.
Now we think most of the fungi are insects, but actually in warm areas, many birds and whales also have fungi.
Many tropical flowers are red, which is because they're yellow and birds, like us, we think it's very good to see red.
But if you look at the lights, the birds and us, we see the red, the green, and the blue.
The insects see green, blue and purple lines, they can see all kinds of dark blue lines.
There are other colors behind here.
"If we can see those colors, "I hear you ask.
Yeah, we can see.
So what do you see?
Last week, I took pictures of these deserts, half-days, in Tosset.
As we've seen, these are little flowers, and they're everywhere.
That's what it looks like when it's visible.
If it looks like it's going to take off red.
Most of the honeys don't feel red.
And then I put the outer camera in front of my mirror at a certain rate of time, and then I got this photo.
It's like a really weird heart.
Now we don't know what honey looks like, and when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We can't know what happened there, whether it's insects or other humans' brains.
But it looks like it's like that, from the background.
It's another little flower -- somewhere between different angles, different angles, to match different mussels.
It looks like that.
In order to avoid feeling that all the yellow flowers have this feature -- in the process of filming; just put it on three feet, not pulled down -- under the sky, and look at this.
It can be a defense base, because it's working through absorbing radiation.
It may therefore be useful for its chemicals.
Finally, it was a night of dreaming that Bjorn Rosslett sent me to Norway -- a strange hiding pattern.
I like this way of hiding.
I think that's very clever.
This is the main use of this mirror.
Of course, the planet is a god of love and birth, it's a flower language.
Just like the flowers spent so much energy trying to attract the fans to accept their invitation, they don't know why, they also successfully convince us that they contain richness when we're born and dead, especially when you think about it, that at this moment the genetic material moves from one body to another.
Thank you very much.

On 26 July, the new Central Network reconvened the Commission on Urban Development and Reform, which, as it is currently withdrawing 4404 fishermen, accounted for 42.54 per cent of the total population involved in fisheries.
This year, 53-year-old Leather received an interview with a new online journalist who said that his father was fishing in the Rondong River when he was 11 years old, he was fishing with his father, fishing on a boat, riding on a boat, riding on a beach, and going on a long way down, leaving home every day for 10 days and living on a fishing family.
But since 1997, as the rural population has moved to the village, the population in the city has increased and environmental pollution has increased.
It built a paper factory, a factory, a plantation, and water pollution.
By 2007, in 2008, the Lung River had become a waste of water.
"All the fish's caught is black, and then it's black."
The country of Lithuania says it is becoming more difficult to catch fish after the river is contaminated.
The locals began to pollute the waters of the Great GHG, including fresh, fertilized, water-based resources, etc.
The country of Lithuania also withdrew from the fishermen and became a member of the patrol, protecting water resources.
Since 1 January 2020, total arrests have been carried out in urban areas for the conservation of living water and related waters in the capital areas.
Based on the data from the Commission on Urban Development, as at the present time, a total of 3403 fishing vessels have been recovered, 4643 fishing agreements have been signed, 63.3 per cent of the three-year overall mandate, 86.3 per cent.
A total of 42.54 per cent of the total number of people involved in fishing has been withdrawn from 4404.
Of the 4404 persons who have been arrested, 4267 persons have been recruited and accounted for 96.89 per cent of the people who have been kidnapped.
The old insurance guarantee covers 2691 persons, representing 61.10 per cent of the fishermen.
The next step will be the deepening of dedicated management actions to speed up the progress of the phase-out border management using project cleaning, complete a new cycle of the river discharge census and carry out appropriate cleaning operations, essentially completing the mandate of "Three" (i.e. mining, mining and stone warehouses), the reform of the small water treatment process, the further expansion of the two coastal greening operations, the strengthening of the construction of the green mines, the consolidation of the mine infractions, the illicit recovery of the target results, and the deepening of the deepening of the deepening of deep-root detention.
Strengthening of Israel's prevention of the response to the sanctions -- new networks
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: Light Day writer: King's Responsibilities
Strengthening of Israel ' s prevention of the recurrence of sanctions
The outbreak of the outbreak of the outbreak of the new flu epidemic was a clear consequence of Israel's control measures.
However, with the gradual decoupling of control measures, the number of new vaccines in recent Israel has increased significantly, and the Government of Israel has taken more and more urgent measures to strengthen the prevention of vaccines.
On 28 February, the Israeli soil was the first example of a new case of lung cancer that was taken quickly to close all exit gates, stop the unnecessary industry, retraining schools on the Internet, restrict public transport and non-required social activities, blocking serious vaccinations in the city, and joint military defence control initiatives.
This series of measures soon had a positive effect, and by mid-May, the new outbreaks of leprosy were re-entered into a number of places.
With the control of the vaccine situation, Israel's prevention measures are completely blocked, and since June, new vaccines have been reconfirmed by a number of reconnaissances.
In particular, post-July, the rate of spread of the vaccine is increasing rapidly.
In recent days, there have been eight days of the new Israeli daily outbreak of the disease as of 25 July, with 916 new cases being completed.
As of 25 July, Israel had a true case of cancer, with a death rate of 448.
The Government of Israel has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen its prevention of the situation.
On 6 July, following the outbreak of the exact number of infectious diseases, the Israeli Government closed health-care centres, swimming pools, bars, and public places, such as the General Assembly at night, while imposing restrictions on public transport policies, providing that every passenger in public transport cannot be more than 20 persons.
On 17 January, the Government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of the "Blood Towns", which included the implementation of the "Blood Towns" at 5 p.m. on Friday to 5 p.m. each week.
During this period, the public will be able to leave, but shops, shopping centres, restaurants, beautiful hotels, libraries, animal gardens, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist places will be closed, and basic services such as supermarkets will remain open.
At the same time, in all dates and periods, more than 10 persons are prohibited from meeting, health-care facilities, workplaces, restaurants and coffee offices will be closed, only allow for the provision of out-of-sale services.
At the same time, the people of Israel did not pay sufficient attention to the seriousness of the vaccine situation and could not form an alliance with the Government in combating the vaccine situation.
Following the return of Israeli sanctions, many people were on the street fighting for their own economic interests because of government control measures.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people held demonstrations in Tel Aviv, which considered the impact of anti-personnel policies on the economy.
In the evening of the 21st night, thousands of protesters gathered in the presence of Prime Minister Nitaniah Huu in Jerusalem, protesting Prime Minister Nitaniah Huu proposed a ban on the restaurant and did not provide adequate compensation for preventive measures such as the coffeehouse food.
In addition, many people did not comply with the provisions of the two-metre security society, which were not allowed to be punished by the police because of not wearing the mask, while many people simply put their shoes on or tied on their hands.
During the period of vaccination, schools were a major area in the spread of new vaccines, and it was found that young children's teachers and students were not able to carry their shoes, nor were they able to keep a distance of two-mile security society, hiding the virus for a large number of teachers.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the National Security Commission for Israel ' s National Anti-Visitant Expert Advisory Mission, said that Israel was heading towards the " dangerous situation", noting that the measures taken by Israel currently were not sufficient to close all breaks, recreational places and schools to control the situation further.
Waksman said that Israel lacked the overall plan for combating the vaccine situation, and that Parliament and the Government should reject their various interests as soon as possible and reach agreement on the issue of the vaccine, and to develop clear steps, including the relevant restrictions on the various sectors.
This is Telaviv 25 July, this is Telaviv newspaper.
Nin-Sahan's farmers, but the old-fashioned farmers, and the old-fashioned couple, they sat in the car, from house to house, to the Cultural Museum.
Although these two years' legs are impossible, 77-year-old Day's well-being is still expected to "come here and play."
This is an invisible building in the state of the ancient city of ancient times, unlike the General Farmhouse, which is often the source of the rain forest, as well as the beautiful film, the landscape, the traditional pineapple, the pineapple, the pineapple, and the pineapple.
The Lord of the Throne, the Ancient.
More than 10 years ago, he started to build a cultural library.
The cultural life of the villagers has become rich.
Newspapers have not yet entered the Hall of Fascism, and the music of the opera has already been broadcast.
The choice of singing for the villagers is that of the village village's villagers.
She's a young girl who has had a little reputation in the area now, and she'll come to the Cultural University for the show for her neighbors.
More recently, Barry has been playing live online.
"There's a stage to make more people see their performance, it's a happy thing."
On the stage, the performer's eye is one eye, the player's singing one song, even though he's a lover, but he doesn't lose his enthusiasm.
Like the style of agronomist's garden garden, it comes out of the corner, with the art and non-general cultural face of the Grand Shrine.
The House has also collected farm materials from various generations, traditional and handmade wafers, cuts, cracks, paintings, and more than 300 natural items.
The poem drew the journalist's cell in the hallway, showing his collection of old items, old wines, three-sixes, and a line car.
Why does a common farmer build a cultural building?
"The film is my home story, and I've been learning it since I was 15. "
The Museum of Cultural Heritage was established in 2012 as the first "non-material cultural heritage in Ninsha village" and is a model building for the protection of cultural heritage of the former city.
In addition to the Huang culture building, there were more than 120 cultural halls in the city and 79 civil exhibition groups, of which there were more than 50 in some sizes of the Cultural Library, such as the House of the River, the Royal Museum of Culture, the House of the King of Yao-Quo-Quo-Quo-Quantu, and the towns and streets of the province.
These geologists lived on the ground, enriched the cultural life of the people, and satisfied their spiritual needs.
"The more we live, the more traditional culture can't be abandoned."
"The Lord of the Wars" comes back again and again to the Countess of the Countess of the Countesss against "the New War"
The 40-year-old "winning" game will be launched on 16 July in Beijing.
"Victory" is based on the fact that it has been written in the cave for many years, the first Soviet military file.
In the midst of the drama, a popular actor, who was known as the "smoothing" in the drama, challenged a cheerful "smoothing agent".
In recent years, the "professor"-faced roses, such as the "smoker" and the "smokers" all prove that the art of war has the power to win.
Unlike the former warheads, "Cultify the world" to extend the history background to the eastern part of the Soviet Union.
It was based on the final phase of the war against the Day of 1944, which described the failure of the intelligence staff in the Middle East to carry out, under the leadership of the People ' s Republic of China and the Director of the United Nations High Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the People ' s Republic of China, "Mudadura" of the Sudan.
In a number of battles, men's main brains as a high-level wave, one of which is the air, the highly intelligent, the perfect image.
But it seems that such a person is not fit to be an interstellar, "I should be the one who can't find the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's not the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's not the other."
So, in the "winning", Don't be so eager to design the master of his performance as a happy "stupid agent".
Another "winning" event was the gathering of the world's capital of the Office of the Chief of the Police of the Japan Police, which was held in Zhaoqwa.
The two forces of the North and South had added a lot of high-powered views to the whole.
"It's really a game, and they're two special dreams, and they're very exciting to me. They're often 'now', like we're writing about half-page lengths, and I'm not stopping when I'm filming, and they can't be played all the time."
There is no playing between the top and the top, and no playing, and when players are in their role and ensure their own human status, not only can they play a role from a human perspective, but they can bring more perspective to the audience, and they can say that this is a good thing.
In the drama, you can also see a number of familiar faces in the "Chief Wars" and three of the "F4s" in the name of the "Winds" were also gathered in the "Chiefs".
This time, the left-hand side of the boat was played by the Anabaptists and the Ouagadougou.
"The two of them have nothing to do with them, they're just in that time, and they're flying around in that environment."
"We're going to have a feeling. This feeling must be bad for people around me, bad people are enemies, but we're going to develop them, and our team's going to grow."
In the drama, these two men were also carefully designed, and he was confident that a satisfactory reply would be given to the audience.

Four of the students were killed in a flood in the Nemongua Valley, official: the incident hits the alarm-in-new network.
On the night of the 25th evening of July, in the middle of the new network, the newspaper was informed that four students in the area died from thirst.
At 1550 hours on 24 July, 110 reports were received from the Department of Public Security of the Afghan People ' s Republic of the Congo that six primary students were in the area.
Following the arrest of the police, the local police took the first time to the scene, rescued two students, then the local emergency department, the water station, and took part in rescue operations.
It was suggested that the rescue site had formed public security police, forest police, fires, hospitals, and the rest of the rest of the population, sent three leather ships to continue fighting around the water area, and requested the professional relief team to reach the site and to search for water through sound detection.
It was found that local relief personnel were first exposed on 25 July at 6.40 p.m. and 1130 p.m. on 25th., that the second met students were found to be in difficulty, that at 1240 p.m., the third met, and that the last hit student was found at 1334 hours, and that more than 4 people were on the ground, with no life-threatening bodies identified by 120 emergency relief centres.
Officially, this water accident struck the whole society.
At present, the relevant local government departments are organizing some water prevention knowledge, hoping that disaster will not occur again.
On 25 July, the President of the Hong Kong Government of Finance and the Office of the Bank of Hong Kong announced that the financial markets in Hong Kong remained active and functioning in a orderly manner.
He welcomed Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
It is likely that, at the 24th (Torendo Time) online seminar organized by the Hong Kong Economic Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce (Canada General Assembly), Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation because of the "adjustment of the flu" and the new vaccine.
Port exchange rate stability and the exchange of assurance levels with the force.
The banking system did not have clear financial flows, on the other hand, more than $11 billion since June.
The total savings of the bank also continued to increase over the past few months, and the stock market had a series of public procurement fund activities, and the market had an increase.
It may be pointed out that the new vaccine situation has brought pressure on the global economic and financial markets, but the basic advantage of Hong Kong remains unchanged.
There are many advantages in Hong Kong, including geographical, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and financial resources, and a simple low-tax regime that continues to serve as the leading international financial centre in Hong Kong.
It may be pointed out that the Government of the Special Area has estimated $60 million in the "Pharmacovigilance Fund" and has created approximately 30,000 temporary positions in public and private domains in the future.
In order to support the development of financial technology, the Special Government has also launched "Millions Plans" to finance local financial technology companies, starting with other financial technology-related enterprises, to create 1,000 new positions, with the recruitment of locals and financial technologies in Hong Kong alone.
Looking forward to the future, let us express our appreciation for Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian businesses to make the best use of Hong Kong and to develop and invest as international financial centres, international asset and wealth management centres and the status of the global currency operations of the peoples out of the Far East, in Hong Kong and nearby areas.
China's anti-virus efforts to encourage countries to learn new experiences in China.
As a country with a population of 14 million, China, like Europe or the United States, has been effectively controlled by the current stage of the new vaccination situation, but has not yet shown a wide range of coverage, which has largely controlled the situation in the country.
The article stated that in almost ten years, China's investment in domestic research and public health-building has made it much more prepared for the new champion than for the high-pressure concentration (SARS) of the year.
The author said that China was not prepared at the launch of the SARS in 2002, especially when the disease was not identified.
When new vaccines were discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus, and they shared genetic data with the international community on 11 January 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from the mainland of China and Hong Kong identified the virus’s underlying characteristics and warned the world of the new virus through the research paper published on the "Blood".
China has also been at the forefront of the vaccine study and has announced that, under emergency conditions, it is possible to conduct such studies very quickly and strictly through domestic cooperation, and in May and July, it has published the results of the progress of the early experiments developed by China in new vaccines, respectively, in May and July.
The experience of China shows that investment in national health and research systems is essential for the effective improvement of laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, in particular low-income and middle-income countries, are highly worthy of recognition and learning.
In addition, China's experience has demonstrated that, on a strong basis of research, there must be a strong high level of reliance on science on the basis of the right decisions, which enables the new climate to be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes the need for Governments and their leaders to respect science, understand the value of science, and take action against it in the most favourable way in society.
In the early stages of the attack, the National Security Commission of China sent three group of infectious experts to Al-Qahan to investigate the risks and spread of the new outbreaks, based on the decision of 23 January "The City" of Wahman; when the experts presented the need and urgency of the construction hospital, the Government quickly made decisions and quickly implemented; while broad participation of communities and populations also resulted in rapid control of the vaccine situation.
Finally, the article stressed the need for enhanced global cooperation and joint response in response to global health emergencies.
The General Journalist.
The first tour of the U.S. City of U.S. City of U.A. in the Nemonto region was detached from the partition of the New Network.
On 26 July, in accordance with the information received by the Committee of the Regions of the Interior of the Congo, the Committee of the Regions of the Regions approved the fact that the Committee of the Regions of the Congo had conducted a constitutional review of the issue of serious violations of the laws of the Baltic Sea of the former Coast Guards of the U.S.
It was discovered that the Baltic Sea was the leading department of the Party, with the idea of loss of trust, a private private breach of the principle of anti-participativeism, a change in vision; organization of the perception of desertification, a violation of the organization of the movement of others and the acquisition of other assets in the election of the Department; an economic collapse, a violation of the economic interests of the business, a right to trade in property, a right to self-determination; and a deterioration of life and an adverse impact.
The White Sea is a serious violation of political discipline, organizational discipline, clean discipline, life discipline, which constitutes a violation of the law of duty and is suspected of committing crimes of corruption, corruption and, after the 18th anniversary of the party ' s unaccompanied, unaccompanied, cruel and harsh treatment.
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the " " Monitoring of the People's Republic of China " regulations of the People's Republic of China, under which the Committee of the Secretary-General of the Republic of Mongolia considered and reported the approval of the Committee of the Parties to the Non-Self-Governing Region of Mongolia decided to grant a division of the Party's nationality to the Baltic Sea by adjusting its treatment as provided for in the provisions of its violation of the law; to transfer its alleged crime to the prosecutors in accordance with the law on the review of the prosecution and the transfer of the property involved.
At 25 p.m. on the ground, a small plane hit a multi-level building in Wessel County, north of Germany, where the accident killed three people.
The Duisburg prosecutor, the Westerville Police and the Wester City Fire Department jointly announced that on that night about 1440 hours a small plane was hit on the house of a multi-level building at the Upper House of House of Commons in Wessel County, which resulted in the death of three people.
On that day, he flew from the town of Mal in the Ruhr region of North Vietnam, and stopped at the airport in Wessel, and then hit the building.
Two passengers on a woman's home and a small plane were killed or killed.
A two-year-old in the house was injured and rescued.
The rest of the house has not been damaged in the accident, but the situation remains unsatisfied.
The presence of a scene in the newspaper of The New York City shows that an accident caused by an accident caused by an accident caused by a fire, which the firemen could see seriously damage to their houses after the fire had been destroyed.
At present, the reason for the loss of the aircraft is unclear.
"Leather Post" called on the police to report that there was a request to show that the plane had been decommissioned before hitting the house.
The police indicated that several parts of the missing aircraft were found in an accident site.
The German Criminal Police, together with the Duisburg prosecutor, jointly investigated the case by the Federal Aviation Investigation Board of Germany.
On that day, it was reported from the General Council of China in Dusseldov that there was contact with the local police and the fire department and that there was no Chinese citizen of the victim.
On 26 September, the Ministry of Health announced that as at 12 a.m., Singapore had added 481 new cases to the new case, 50369 cases, and 27 cases of deaths.
Data show that, in new cases, 5 of these cases are local community diseases, 4 of these are cases of introduction, and the rest of them are foreign workers living in specific accommodations.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore said that 98 per cent of new cases of infectious diseases were related to known cases of infection.
There are currently 173 new patients treated in the hospital, most of which are stable or improved and no one is in the hospital.
In addition, 4648 persons were separated from community facilities.
In Singapore, the majority of the new target groups are foreign workers.
According to statistics, Singapore has a total of 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 foreign labour centres, and some 100,000 foreign workers live in other types of housing.
In the past, Singapore's Intersectoral Working Group on Anti-Frauds said that the Government of Singapore was intensifying its examination of the latest new target foreign labour centres for higher levels of infection.
After completing the inspection of all assigned premises, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to re-employed, but they will still have to carry out a new check regularly.
"Gizon according to the will" in the Grand Duchess-Newway.
On 18 July, the twenty-third International Film Festival at the top of the sea released a list of filmlists by the officials of the Golden Throne.
The first real-time film "Gizon according to the will" was successfully filmed around the top of the film, while the video was published by the official at the top of the screen.
I'm going to get a picture of the beach.
The video "Gizon according to the will" was the first real material to be played by the Grand Duchess, and he joined the second with the Golden Prize.
The film told a story like this: A comedy film led to a surprise and went back to an old village in the north of the country, hoping that a family would be filmed for years, resulting in a series of surprises.
Family members gathered for the film finished the final meeting.
In the film star newspaper today, one of the family — the "three-foot" King Jiang, sitting in the center of the picture, the background of the northern black land on the bank, the prospect of China being the red light that was required for the year.
It seems that the complex and complexities of this large family relationship were formed by the red light of the group and the yellowish queen of the body.
It was reported that, in addition to the three-year-old daughter of the King Jiang, the film was played by actors, the rest were completed by real leaders, the video's experimental audiences broke the drama and the true border, and brought the audience a new intuitional visual experience.
According to a major presentation, the creation of "Gizon according to the will" comes from "a day's purpose " , a series of changes in families such as theirs, that the original film plans must be changed without the final recording of life as a film, but that they release beyond design.
How does the leader of the great crowd deal with this "God will " and how should we continue to receive the kind of change that brought about this day?
There is no doubt that "Giji's will" is full of experience and that almost all the people's imagination and the innovative way of listening make life before the mirror a film, and under the true image package, the audience will also find a picture of herself and the family from the family in which the video was shown, with the closing of the family meeting in the film.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Number of hotline statistics for new type-emergency virus coordination centres (08H00-26 July)
Between 25 and 26 July 2020, from 08H00 to 08H00, the search hotline of the new focal point for chromium virus should be connected to 292 telephones.
The 291 survey on the condition of the vaccine was immediately forwarded to the representative of the relevant sector, as follows:
Health Service 271 (related to: investigation of separation; testing of chlorofluorocarbons; investigation of two maps; health code; others)
17 of the Police Department (related to: search for exit measures; search for exit measures in both Australian and Pacific road vehicles; search for the hotline of the Red Sea government; question of the retention of documents.)
1 mission of the travel agency (related to: question of separation of hotels.)
1 Young People ' s Education Office (related to: Search for ways to return the Australian students to the British Library)
1 of the Department of Maritime Affairs and Water Affairs (related to the question of whether access to Hong Kong fishing ports is required to report to the Bureau on matters relating to the testing of mercury.)
Balancing the healing site, the chief of the rest of the war and a military service station.
In the average temperature of this year, a simple room is set up at the foot of the mountain, and the camp is not far from the flag of the country, and the soldiers are at work stations in the wind every day, while regularly traveling to higher ground patrols on the sea.
The warriors have to climb up the rocky cliffs. They need their feet and use them.
The harvest season is on the decline of July, when the low-season region grows, and in the bazaar, there are relatively complex greens in the mountains behind the camp.
At that point, six-year-old warriors pointed to the mountains, which were their backyards, and only on August 7 a.m. each year could see the young rose slowly, and after a short time, all of them turned yellow and were covered with snow.
Step-by-step patrols, maybe nine hours in time.
In the worst weather, the warriors who live here are with snow and ice all year round, and they have to travel to a higher mountain range on a regular basis.
Earlier, a patrol team consisting of eight soldiers walked again under the leadership of the leader's archipelago.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds, and one big hits the target.
One of the fighters in the way, the friends of the war are in urgent need of relief.
In addition to patrols, soldiers who are at the point of healing are required to perform art and physical training every day.
Over a minute, the sea level continues to rise, the oxygen levels increase, the body continues to pass, and these factors test the will of the patrols.
They're strong, they're going across several sides, they're going through some emergency.
At 16 hours, it was the lunchtime of the patrols that they took their food from where they sat at a place over 5700 miles [5700 km] from the sea, accompanied by raindrops, and filled with food.
The battlers of Balanese healing points perform art and physical training.
During the rest, they will play cards together, and the victims will be able to play, enjoy, and play.
After a short rest in the cold, they climb up this patrol target site, take the flag out of the mountain, and make a solemn vow.
After that, they were the most secure guards in the country.
Beijing Consumer Renewal - New Network
Beijing's activities are relaunched according to the principle of "total reopening, focus planning, orderly progress and strict organization" in Beijing.
On 26 July, a total of 1.5 million political prisoners were released, with a total of 1 million food and 50 million intelligent products. Consumers can be obtained in Kyoto APP.
The Vice-President of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce presented a presentation at the 25-day press conference, which was reopened, with a further reduction in corporate co-financing, based on the maintenance of existing consumer card subsidies.
From August onwards, the current adjustment of $1:1 to 2.1, for example, was made by the original consumer, if a card was received at the store for 120 benefits, of which the Government subsidizes 60, of which the company grants $60; of which 80 to the subsequent government subsidies, and of which the company receives 40.
During the period of consumption, three major operators will make up around 5G consumption subsidies for flows and terminals, further promoting Beijing 5G new base and 5G new consumption.
The Huangbos report that the economy in Hong Kong is being attacked again because of the plague.
On 26 July, Hong Kong, Director of the Financial Division of the Government of Hong Kong, said that Hong Kong was facing a new outbreak of cancer, a new outbreak of cancer, a first phase of re-enterprising business and economic activity.
The Government of the Region once again called for the reduction in the rent of small businesses, with the retail business, food and medium-sized enterprises.
Zhao-Boo's online article entitled "The Way of Rehabilitation."
He said that a high number of cases in recent Hong Kong were serious, affecting social life, and also disturbing the economy.
In response to the vaccine response, the main priority is to prevent the introduction of a case and to address and interrupt the virus transmission chain as soon as possible; the economic activities should be restored in due course when the vaccine is controlled.
He noted that, in the face of a new outbreak of vaccines, the first to see the repurchasing business and economic activities were also being fought.
In addition to the spirit of the contract, social responsibility is equally important for the business community, particularly for those groups that have received significant government support in the "Paragraph of Employment".
He mentioned that Hong Kong's second quarter economic situation is still very serious this year, but the savings situation seems to slow down slightly.
On the export side, he felt that the external situation in Hong Kong was still serious.
Zhao-bo said that the development history of Hong Kong over the past decades has shown that every crisis has taken a new opportunity and every difficulty has hidden the keys to future development.
A few years ago, a winter morning in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I drove to work, I found that the city was covered with mud.
I'll drive around there almost every day, but this time I've never seen such a vision before.
Johnnesburg's name is not unique to it, but it's almost invisible that morning.
I soon realized that what I saw was a serious shock caused by air pollution.
The beautiful environment I've known of the past and the contrast between the celestial spheres, which I've come to know in my heart.
I'm worried that it's possible that the sun's brilliantly colored sun will be covered with dark clouds.
At the moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just look at it like that.
The biggest challenge is, I don't know about environmental science, air quality management, or gas chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm very sure I can't solve the problem of air pollution.
What identity am I going to resolve this?
I'm just a town boy.
In the next few years, I learned a very important lesson, and if we want to achieve a better future, we should all remember this lesson.
Even if you're not an expert in some particular area, your professional skills may also include ways to solve the problem in that area.
Sometimes, your unique perspective can trigger a very normal, left-wing situation, but you need to be very brave to try.
That's the only way you can know the results.
What I knew then was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution, so I went back to a student.
I've done some basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world's biggest environmental health risk.
The World Health Organization data show that in 2012, almost 14 per cent of the world's deaths were caused by major air pollution in the family and around, especially in low-income countries.
The rate of mortality caused by major air pollution each year is higher than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, the early rise in unsafe health conditions, or the death of children from malnutrition, appears to be weak in the face of atmospheric pollution, while it also brings huge economic costs: According to the Statistics of Economic Cooperation and Development Organization, expenditure relating to 2013 exceeds $40 billion.
In my work, I'm looking for the results of science and technology, including the social relationships of humans and machines, finding a useful starting point and helping us make better decisions.
When I think about the problem of air pollution, how to control the pollution of the atmosphere, things become clear, we need to find a better way to make a better decision, taking into account the big issue, co-operation is very important.
So I decided to get to know some people working in this area.
I started an official dialogue with Johnnesburg and other nearby cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I also phoned some people who were completely alive.
These experiences that I've been involved have helped me to understand this issue more deeply.
It also helps me to avoid my actions when I try to make innovations and sometimes break down the barriers: before I really have a problem, I'm quick to use a technique.
I'm starting to think, what can I do to improve this situation?
I started to ask myself how to integrate my knowledge skills in software engineering and human engineering and the professional skills of my contacts.
I want to create an online air quality management platform, to reveal future pollution trends, to carry out relevant predictions to determine what might happen.
I'm sure my idea could be a real solution, but also facing uncertainty, and I can't guarantee it's certain success.
(Laughter) Of course, for those who have been working in the Great Air Pollution field for many years, my skills are completely new.
I gradually realized that sometimes a new perspective, a new set of skills, can lead to something far superior.
Our will and imagination is a lamp to guide us through obstacles, opening up a new chapter.
I developed a deeper understanding of climate pollution issues, found data from the past ten years, as well as weather data from Johannesburg and around.
This software can analyse history and real-time data to expose the trends of pollution with time and space changes.
We'll then use new machine learning technology to predict future pollution.
This means that residents can make better decisions on their daily routine and where they live and where they live.
We can predict adverse pollution events, define serious pollution sources, and allow the relevant authorities to submit orders to adjust their operational activities.
How to expand infrastructure, such as the location of the industrial area, can be better decided by urban planners.
We've already set up a first-run experiment on that technology, running 120 days, covering all South Africa.
Our expected results have been confirmed, and the predictive data we show and the data we collect on our territory have shown a close relationship.
Through our management, we have introduced world-leading gravitational instruments, predicting great air quality, its analyticality and correctness are not seen before, so that the city I've entered soon as early as dawn can be useful. Then I said to myself, "Some things are wrong, what do I have to do?"
So, the focus is, what if I didn't do it in the first place?
What if I don't care about the state's environmental situation and send hope to some places, some other people take care of these things?
What I learned from the point of view is that when we're all convinced of something, it's very important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences that don't work out.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should encourage us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find some kind of curiosity about your nature, it's excited, and it's about what you're thinking, you have some crazy or courageous ideas, even if it's not your professional field, ask yourself, "Why don't you try?"
Why don't you go ahead and solve the problem?
Maybe you'll have an accident.
Thank you, everyone.
(Applause)
This year, the largest earthquake in the eastern region of Taiwan takes place in the new world.
On 26 July, the New American Society in the Middle East was the biggest earthquake in the country, the largest earthquake in the world, the largest one in the world, the largest earthquake in the East Taiwan area of 26 hours a day, and the largest earthquake in the whole year.
The integrated Central Company, electronic media, such as Ettoday Newspapers, reported that the earthquake was 86.5 km south of the Government of East Thailand, the region of eastern Taiwan, and 53 km deep.
The Chinese earthquake network estimates this earthquake to 5.5 degrees.
The largest earthquake in the whole area is: the 4th floor, the 4th floor, the 4nd floor, the East, the South floor, the 3rd floor, and other cities.
The Taiwan Meteorological Sector notes that this earthquake has been the largest in Thailand since this year and that there has been no cloudy earthquake in the area, and it has been more active in the past year than in the past.
In the coming week, there is still no exception to the remainder of the above 4 levels.
Many people think that driving is one thing that only people can see.
The blind want to drive a single safe car until now, it's also considered an impossible mission.
All right, I'm Dennis Hunt, and for the freedom and independence of the blind, we've created a car designed for those with visual barriers.
Before I talk about this blind man's car, let me just say something else that I've done, called the U.S. Department of Higher Education, the city challenge.
It's about making a machine that can drive itself.
You start by pressing the key, not touching anything, and it can reach its purpose completely automatically.
At the 2007 challenge, our team won $5 million and won the third.
About that time, the National Association of Blinds, or the Association of Blinds, posed a challenge to the design team about who could design a car that could make the blind independent of safety.
We think we're gonna try, because we think, uh, where's this going?
We already have an automatic car.
We just need the blind to drive in there. That's not going to work, is it?
(Laughter) But we're not sure what's wrong.
A blind conscience is not a car that can contain a blind person's confusion, but a blind person can take the initiative to make a choice and drive.
So we have to give up everything we have from the beginning.
To test this crazy idea, we designed an original car of a small sand truck to test its effectiveness.
In the spring of 2009, we invited a lot of young people in the country and gave them the opportunity to take advantage of this car.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem of this car is that its design can only allow the blind to walk in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot-- even on a small road with red traffic.
So with this success, we decided to take the next important step, to create a real car that could be on the real road.
How does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain and simplify.
We have three stages.
We have an emotional phase, a calculation phase and a non-visual interface.
Drivers are obviously invisible, so the system must be able to sense the environment and collect data for drivers.
That's what we're using the initial equation.
It measure speed, angle speed-- like a human ear, neural.
I combine this information with the global position system to predict the location of the vehicle.
We're also using two cameras to explore the road.
We're also using three X-rays.
The radiation scans the environment to detect obstacles -- from the front, from the rear, from the rear, to the rear, while any obstacle from the road, to any obstacle around the vehicle.
All the information of the sea will then be collected into the computer, and the computer will do two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the environment -- which are the roads, which are obstacles -- and translate these information to drivers.
It's also a highly intelligent system that can figure out the safest road.
We can also send orders on how the vehicle works.
But the question is, how can we transmit information and instructions to the blind to ensure that he can fly?
For this, we've designed a lot of different non-visual user interface technologies.
The first triangular sound system, the shock of the back, the sound of the wheel, the legs, even the shoes of the foot.
But today we're talking about three of them non-visual user interface technologies.
First face is called a driver.
It's a piece of hand, and it's part of a crash in the section, so you can transmit the instructions -- direction and direction.
Another device called a speed band.
This car chair-- actually, it's a motorcycle.
We split it out, we regroup the shock elements of different models, we let them pass information at speeds, and there's a way to use the oil door and the car.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, because you can't see the impact, we actually installed red light two-eyed on the driver, so he can see what's going on.
This is sensitive data. This data is transferred from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the wheel and the speed belt, are very effective.
But the problem is, these are the command signal device.
So it's not really freedom, is it?
Computer tells you how to ride-- left, right, right, speed, car.
I'm calling it an adventure problem.
So we're avoiding the alarm device, and more attention to the information device.
A typical example of this invisible information interface is called the sky map.
Look at this as an indicator of the blind.
It's a small desk, there's a lot of roofs on it, and the pressure out of the air, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're a blind man, you put your hands on it, you can feel the road and obstacles.
Actually, you can also change the frequency released in the air, and there may be other temperatures.
It's actually a multi-user interface.
Here, you can see the left, the right-hand camera head, and how the computer analyzes and transmits these information to the sky map.
So, we're showing a simulation process, a blind man is using an airplane.
This procedure has a great deal of help on the basis of different types of non-visual user interfaces for trainers and quick-tested different theories.
That's basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it won't be on its way unless it's proved to be as safe as it is now, or safer.
I'm sure this will happen.
But, is it social, can they accept this inspiration?
How do we handle insurance?
How are we gonna print the photos?
There are many different obstacles behind the technical challenges that we need to deal with before they really become reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car of blind people.
But what's more important than this is the enormous value of the sub-products contained in this project.
It can be used to see the dark, rainy sensor.
And this new interface, we can use these techniques to provide them with more secure vehicles for the visible groups.
Or for the blind, the daily household appliances -- education facilities, office facilities.
Imagine, in the classroom, teachers write notes on the blackboard that blind students can also use these invisible borders to understand and read what teachers write.
It's very precious.
Today, what I'm showing to everyone is just a start.
Thank you very much.

The Chinese Doctor is filming anti-Visitors-New War Network.
In recent days, with respect for Chinese filmmakers against the HIV hero, the director of the Bourne Film Group in winter, led by a powerful (left) performance in Gång State and the Chinese Academy of Films on Anti-Purchase Films, "China Doctor".
Bona's mining industry hopes to be hired by the Chinese doctor, to all the doctors who fight in the field of anti-psychotic prevention, and to all those who work to prevent it!
In 2021, the film will be released as a national anniversary of the 100th anniversary of the dedication of the Chinese Communist Party.
At present, with the deployment of the Central and National Film Agency, the Boona Film Office and the Chinese Film Office, with the support of the Chinese Film Society and the Chinese Film Office, organized the film "China Chief" filming Chinese Doctors" as a reflection of the strong leadership of the Party's central leadership and a film against the situation of the New PhD.
The video collects a series of anti-Smokers, which will provide a human background, from a human point of view, use unique syllables, as well as a highly explosive target language, with a full range of sensitive stories of Chinese doctors who are dedicated and self-sacrifice.
It is understood that at the first time on the day of the U.S.A., the Bourne Company has overcome the challenge of sending a group of deep-rooted infections, sharing information with hundreds of hospital workers, and gathering information, which has now been addressed, including the staff of the Hong Kong Foundation, the first person in the state to support the U.S. and the W.A. Hospital, the U.S.A. Hospital and Hospital, the U.S. Hospital, the U.S.A. Hospital, the W.A. Hospital, and the W.C.A., have produced a large number of valuable first-hand information.
In this conference, the Prime Minister of Hong Kong also offered hope and hope for the film: "I hope that you will not only visit a few top-level experts, but also visit more and more medical personnel who are suffering from headaches, most of them."
He said that he had seen "me and my country" "China President" before, he thought it was a good way to tell the story of the Great Lakes.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
In discussing the release of the video, Prime Minister Junction said that some people from abroad now like to sign a politicalization mark on the virus, and he hoped that the film could move the audience from a human perspective: "It would be best to show the film in the outside world, except in China, to use the way that the outsiders can understand it, to stimulate the spirit of the real human beings."
In the mid-80s, it was the most deep impression I've ever had on the post-review film, or the middle of the year, when my medical friends outside my country were looking at it, and if the Chinese doctor could do this, it would be amazing."
The President of Hong Kong said that if "the Chinese doctor" could cause the public's confusion, that would be very successful.
In the exchange of seats, Prime Minister Hong Kong also shared views and recommendations on the current prevention of international vaccines, " I believe that people are always smarter than the virus. "
Despite the fact that the virus is difficult to predict, from the original society to this day, mankind has passed thousands of risks, and today there are advanced medical and social management measures in modern society, as well as medical personnel around the world, including the elderly, who have a basic knowledge of the scientific response to the conditions of the new vaccine, and who will no longer be moved as they were before, "the work of the two sides, one to examine how to strengthen cooperation around the world, and two to focus on the compassion of the hearts of the people."

"The Red Cross" is the first Red Cross to be seen today.
South-West Newspaper, New South-Weapon, journalist, journalist.
The Red Sea model, the mountain of the East, the expansion of the bourgeoisie works, and the permanent meat of the West... on 25 July, 2020 South Sea Red Tourism Festival opened in the mountains.
As one of the main activities, the first red culture industry exhibition will be held at the tourist consultancy centre throughout the mountains.
The exhibition's red-colored products, the product of the Revolutionary Region's Old Towns, led to the purchase of all visitors.
" This Red Cross, both an exhibition of the results of the national red culture industry, and an exhibition unit and business exchange experience to explore an important platform for development paths. "
The Chief Executives of the Committee on Red Crescent and Red Crescent, presented the theme of the Red Crescent, a total of almost 3,000 square metres, setting the area around the building, showing the area of the Red Cross and the network of Red Crescent Tourism.
I was invited to take part in the event of a demonstration of 768 species, including red writing, work arts, food property, travel routes, red training courses, red-style products, etc., in eight foreign cities in the province of Sasha, Asia, the Sun, and the state of San Juan.
The distribution area will appear until 29 July.
As the owner of the Red Cross, it's a bright spot.
The district managers introduced the distinction between the choline and the red industry and the two main parts of the red cultural development.
The Red Industrial Exhibitions show 31 exhibitions of six companies, including the Red Line, the Green Cultural Development Area, the Red Series, the Red Series, and some 200 products of 27 units, such as Red Series and Green Series.
In the comfort zone, many visitors were attracted to the construction of handmade works and cuts of art.
The Director-General of the Municipal Tourism Office of Macedonia introduced this exhibition with a careful selection of the best-selling red products for nearly two years, of which 16 products are the best products in the country in 2019.
At the same time, they invited national-level non-material cultural heritage protection projects " Ansecut paper " , " Song of the North People" to extend filmmakers at the provincial-based projects, focusing on the extension of the unique products of the Indonesian culture, and taking this opportunity to interact with other regional enterprises in the area.
More than 30,000 new-new-wave cases in Japan.
According to statistics, 26 new cases of infectious diseases in Tokyo, 239 cases, followed by more than 200 cases per day, have been aggregated to 11214 cases.
In addition, the CV141 increases, the CV 90 increases, and the CV 80 increases.
In the last half years, the telecommunications network has grown to seven times the highest level of total coverage.
On 26 July, according to the highest official website, this year, the National Prosecutor's Office has prosecuted 58101 people for fraud, compared with 35 per cent.
In particular, in the prevention of crime, fraud is widespread, and the prosecution body is 43.4% of the total number of offenders.
The Supreme People ' s Prosecutor ' s Office has targeted guidance and, in the case of the 10 cases currently published, a total of 9 cases involving fraud.
From the past half-year-old case, the prosecutors have seen a large number of the names of fraud crimes, and national macroeconomic policies, including the use of vaccines, "medicine" fraud, "healthcare" fraud, "crowding" fraud, "crowding of national subsidies, "crowding of national assets" etc., and "proselytizing new "for education, medicine, employment, housing, social security, degradation, poverty, financial credit, not only for the victims, but also seriously affecting economic social development.
In particular, some telecommunications networks have distorted national boundaries, restrictions on the area and personnel, including public, cross-border, remote, electronic payment characteristics, a large number of non-specific groups of victims.
For example, specialized companies have been established, leased high-quality writing facilities, create multiple sectors or locations, use legal network platforms, recruits, train and review of recruiters, adopt business operating models, cover with "legal outer garments", more confusing.
In accordance with the law ' s penalties and the prevention of crimes, early warning to the public and the relevant sectors is the responsibility of the procuring body.
In the case of judicial offices, the procuratorial body has a serious responsibility to continue to maintain high pressure on counterfeiting and to promote social governance through the dissemination of prosecutorial recommendations.
The procuratorial authority has seriously arrested, prosecuted the facts of the case, found evidence, procedural and legal implications, and has done nothing wrong on the basis of the fact that it is lawful and lawful.
In particular, in relation to the fraud of telecommunications networks, focusing on the central role of electronic data in the identification of facts, efforts to build electronic data, verbal evidence, and mutual evidence links between documents.
In the event of an intrusion by the Public Prosecutor's Office in the province of Ninpur City, the first time the prosecution was involved in an investigation, which resulted in the completion of the case for only five days, reflecting the spirit and determination of the social authorities.
In reviewing the arrest and review of the prosecution cycle, focusing on the prosecution of the case, correcting the arrest of 733 individuals by public security authorities and correcting the disappearance of the prosecutions by 113.
In the last half of the year, the National Prosecutor's Office issued 298 recommendations on counterfeiting, promoting joint prevention of counterfeiting and promoting deep-rooted governance.
For example, the communications companies found in the offices, the Bank, the Inter-Agency Organization, such as the failure in telecommunications network regulation, the Galician City Prosecutor's Office in the province of Gandhi Province, the Office of Public Prosecutors in the east of the country, and the Office of Public Prosecutors in the Middle East, urge the relevant units to strengthen regulation and improve mechanisms to help build an effective system.
Four is doing all you can to track down the damage.
Public prosecutors from all over the country have been involved in investigating evidence of prosecutions, reviewing key elements such as prosecutions, encouraging the investigating bodies to actively pursue the prosecution, working together with the relevant sectors in order to reduce the economic loss caused by crime to the population.
As in a case of a certain case of a block of rent in Beijing City, the case involved a 22-packed block of property survey, where the property may have been previously handled by other cases, the first "simplementation of execution" letter was sent to the relevant court immediately, recommending that the court prior to examining the temporary implementation of the property concerned, to identify the fact that the crime had been established and to make the greatest effort to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The Prosecutor reminds all of us that there is a high level of caution against fraud, and that we should not expect to throw up a bag in the sky, nor that we should simply believe it and keep our money box.
The town of Winnipeg, in the province of Wynn.
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Sustenance Editor: Sustenance
Cooling, economic day-to-day, China's economic network has gone into the town of Winnipeg, in the province of Vienna.
On a hard day, the village's people were in a cave in the base, although their faces were covered with red, but they often sang a few little songs in their mouth.
The town of Wynn, which is in the vicinity of the city, is low in size, high in sea height, high in light, high in night, high in yield, high in sugar, and a certain reputation in the surrounding area, but also because of a small, slightly high price that has not been able to sell well and could not constitute a size of industry.
It was a poor town in the "Calcony Spring" where poverty was rising by 25.8 per cent 10 years ago.
During the crucial period of the era of forced invasion of poverty in the war, traditional farming practices, industrial structures, and increased agricultural income are being forced into exile.
After several visits, a member of the Zheo-Minji People's Committee noted that industrial development could no longer take its course.
To this end, the town has introduced the mining industry to modernize the production of fruit.
In addition to the general management of the Agricultural Limited, Wing has come from the city of Huang in 2015 to explore the conditions of local cultivation and from 2016 to local fruit trees.
In the beginning, the village was moved by Leiki's loyalty to turn the land into a fruit tree, and Lié's faithful wives were in tears: "The fruit has grown so many years, and no one in the village has ever seen the fruit grow. "
"The fruit of the plant is the fruit of the vine, and it will not grow too high. "
The idea is that this plant plant has adopted a new method, that it can grow to the bottom of each fruit tree, that water and nutrients can be added to the tree, and that when the fruit is harvested, the tractor can move directly into the garden, and then it can produce fruit.
At present, the fruit base has gradually entered the harvest period, and the market has not been sold, as it was expected to build a text, and it is popular for urban consumers, such as Beijing, the Upper Sea, and Galway.
The growing crop industry has made new changes in Leigh's life, although it is still on the ground, but income has a new source.
Leigh's loyal family transferred more than 9 tons of land to the fruit-based base, and, apart from the buried land-flow costs, there was also a good deal of red, and the couple were always at work in the base, "one can earn 80 dollars a day, and the rest of the year is active".
Lee told reporters that last year the profit was over 2,200 dollars, plus the transfer of land and the income of his wife's husband's employees, an income of more than 80,000, "no longer wearable, the day of rest is over."
"It has already been effective for more than $15,000, approximately 10 times the type of corn. "
It is reported that there are currently 20,000 fruit trees in the entire town, with only 6000 seeds in the Middle Sea, covering 4056 and 117 million farmers, covering 656,2952 Archipelago poor people, spending more than $60 million in one year's wages, actually reaching the base building at home and not going out to work.
Leik's loyalty, which was encouraged by the boxing day, also began to fulfill his "will."
This year's agricultural festival, Lee had bought a luxury car, and today it's starting to work on a car, "there's ten more land in the house, waiting for the next crop base to grow, and the whole turn to them, and the income is getting bigger."

The new network in the greenhouse effect.
The separation of technical assistance to "the greenhouse effect"
New type of mix basic preparation technology model
This report is reported by a journalist who reported that in the past, the University of Washington, D.C., had made significant progress towards the "depletion of CO2-depletion" team, and had successfully developed a new mix-based preparation technology, with a significant increase in the capacity of carbon dioxide capture.
The results have been published as an international journal on greenhouse gases: science and technology.
"Efficacy" is a major environmental problem that interferes with human development, and CO2 emissions are caused by "Efficacy".
The focus of scientists is how effective the acquisition and use of CO2 emissions are.
"Separation Act" is a emerging carbon capture technology, which, with the aid of solvents, is able to distinguish carbon dioxide from oxygen, which is efficient and operates a simple feature.
How to "inspire deep matter", which increases the efficiency of gas separation, is the difficulty in the use of carbon dioxide-containing bottles.
The scientific team of the University of Saizon research team has innovative ways to explore the impact of different pesticides on the ability to distinguish between gases by re-testing.
The results of the experiment show that N-metallic acid salts, as a preparation agent, increased the distribution of carbon monoxide in the raw material, " more transparent", effectively increased the efficiency and rate of separation of carbon monoxide.
With such a new technology-based blending base, carbon dioxide segregation can be close to the current delimitation of the theory of such fossil materials.
"The new technology has provided a new way for the separation of the law to capture carbon dioxide. "
" We hope that this technology will provide strong support for future fuel plants and industrial enterprises to manage smoke and play a key role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Before it's done, you know what's the new level of professional poverty -- a new network.
Source: Responsibilities, Author, Editor:
Before you're done, you know what's a professional failure.
Each year, students or parents are informed of their wishes, because they do not know the names of the volunteers, and they are affected by the voluntary contributions.
This year, the Beijing University of Transport, the Beijing Institute of Technology, the Beijing E-mail University, the Beijing University of Engineering, the Beijing University of Beijing, and the Beijing University of Labour, jointly published the recruitment policy for 2020 to eliminate the professional gap.
What does the professional level mean, and what is the importance of volunteer reporting?
There are three ways in which the rules of professional distribution are applicable
The expert reminded that, prior to the voluntary return, there must be a detailed reading of the "retirement statute" of the school in the heart of the school, understanding the rules of admission, including the proportion of the files, the rules of professional distribution, etc.
The rules of professional distribution, after the High School Adjustment, are mainly professional priorities, a number of priorities, and three ways of disparity at the professional level.
The way in which higher education is specifically used will be clear in the "retirement statute".
However, there are also principles of access to higher schools that are generally given priority and there is no level between professions.
In other words, in the context of the inclusion, the number of participants will be examined in accordance with the overall classification, when the number of professional volunteers has not reached the number of the first professional volunteers, and the number of professional volunteers will be shown to have reached the second professional voluntary number line, thus leading to the final professional volunteering, and not to the difference between professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional level" is one or more sub-values published in the Recruitment Statute when the School organizes a vocational examination, which is a "professional level".
It is also the percentage difference between the first professional volunteers and not the first professional volunteers, and the interdisciplinary differences, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 seconds.
For example.
In the case of low-skilled students, a 560-point study was conducted with their professional will, respectively, computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, electronic commerce, professional access to higher-level A, with a difference of 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 point.
In the course of professional distribution, if the first professional will comply with professional acquisition requirements and with the planned balance of the professional, the second part will be entered into the " computer" profession; if the computer is not entered, his number will be reduced by 2 points, the results of the first professional voluntary review of "International trade" and determine whether the conditions of professional acquisition are met; if the second part (i.e. 557) is still not met, the third professional voluntary recruitment (i.e., 557) will be reduced if the second part (i. 556) is still not met; if the second part is not completed, the second part will be reduced to the fourth professional occupation; if the second part is not yet completed, the follow-up will not be re-uped if the professional will not yet be fulfilled, and will not be re-up.
Differences in the level of professionalization at the university
In view of the prevalence of parallel voluntary labour, many high schools have now eliminated professional poverty, but some of the higher schools have retained this approach this year and have been seen from the "retirement statute" published by the schools, with more than 20 universities established this year.
For example, University of Chechnya, University of Chechnya, University of Chechnya, University of Chechnya, University of Medicine, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry, University of Chemistry of Medicine, University of Chemistry, University of Medicine, University of Chemistry of Medicine, University of Chemistry of Medicine, University of Medicine, University of Medicine, University of Chemistry of Medicine, University of Medicine, University of Chemistry of Cheon, University of Cheon, University of Cheon, University of the North Electricity, University of the University of the University of Science, University of the University of the University of Science of the University of Sciences, University of the University of Science of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University University University of the University of Ingemememememememememememememein-gemeochin-gemeochin-gemeoch, of the University University University University, University, University, University, University, University, and of Lages, and of the University, University, University, and of the University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University of the University, University, University, University, University, University, University ofmean, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University of the University, University, University, University of the University, University, University, University of the University of the University, University of the University of the University of the University of Ingemean, University of the University of the University of the University of the University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University, University of
In these colleges, the level of vocational training is different from that of each university.
Some colleges have had a low level in each profession, such as the University of Ninsha, and the archives have been sent to the school's students and are ordered by a number of sequences following a reduction in professional will.
And there are different professions between universities and different professions.
For example, at the University of the United States, the Professional Volunteers Division is 4 points, i.e. the first Professional Volunteers and other Professional Volunteers are 3 points; the other Professional Volunteers are not appointed, and the other Professional Volunteers are 1 points.
In the case of voluntary contributions, children and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school in which they are reported, see whether there is a low level of professionality and how the poor form is similar, and, at the same time, reasonably analyse selected schools and professions, if the school has clearly taken a partial differential approach in the recruitment process, and when the student is selected, pay attention to the degree between the professionals and increase the frequency of admissions.
