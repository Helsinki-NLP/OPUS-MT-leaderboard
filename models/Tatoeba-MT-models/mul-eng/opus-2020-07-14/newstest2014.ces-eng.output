A black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying hard to find money to repair a remote network, many start to see solutions in a small black box that can easily get into your car's driveway.
The devices that follow every kilometre that the engine takes along and which transmits this information to the authorities are the core of Washington's controversial forces and state planning authorities to renew the old system of funding of the US main engines.
In general, the bold design of the distance has led to an intense debate and the outcome of the most diverse parties.
The Libertarians met with the ecological groups and sought to enable the government to use these small rectangles that would record the right kilometers and possibly where you are going – and then use these information to set the tax scale.
The party's scared.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of problems with privacy protection.
And while Congress can't agree to continue, some states don't expect anything.
They find out how they can move within the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for the mile of the road he goes.
Thousands of motorists have already turned black shells, some of which have GPS monitoring, to be tested.
This is a real need for our people.
"No matter where we can make a great choice," said Hasan Ikhrat, Executive Director of the U.S. State Administration in southern California, who plans to start monitoring the remaining kilometres in each California motor vehicle in 2025.
It'll change the way we pay these taxes.
That's what this technology is.
The point is that the Railway Credit Fund is funded from the tax paid by the US in the railway stations on the day.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars will take a lot more than a mile on one gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.
Because of the current high gas prices, politicians tend to raise taxes by just one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed the tracking device into 500 cars to test this system for a mile.
"From a long-term perspective it is considered the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee, according to the number of miles taken.
It is no surprise that this idea is popular with urban liberals, since taxes can be used to change the pattern of driver behaviour, which can help, for example, to limit transport cuts and the production of ski lifts.
The California projectors consider this system to be a strategy to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, President of the Transport Committee, said that he also sees it as the most effective long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also forced to think that drivers will be paid within a few kilometres.
"It's not the tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice-president for the Reason strategy.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 the Congress asked for the direction of payment per kilometre.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would include about 10,000 cars.
However, the conduct of the shadow representatives, however, stopped and did so because of the concerns of foreign legislators representing citizens, whose daily life often means affecting many kilometres for work outside the city.
However, a number of states and cities still operate on their own roads.
The worst is Oregon, which has included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state tax for nine miles instead of gas.
I've never finished a pilot project.
New York's just investigating the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in the cost vehicles.
The Coalition I-95, which includes 17 national transport ministers, together with the coastal states on the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not have only a seat.
In Nevada, where nearly 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment, the drivers were worried that the government was able to monitor each move.
"The concerns related to the monitoring of the Big Brother and similar concerns were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who led the management of the strategy and operation of the German Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada on its websites warned: "It would be very easy to change this device to a fully-fledged tracking device."
There is no need to build a massive heavy technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand on the everyday outputs and income of individuals.
Unfortunately, there are several states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to monitor the number of miles of traffic, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be more calm.
He introduced some state agencies to small companies in California called True Mileage (actual distance).
This company was not initially involved in action by the government on the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to sell on the emerging market with a guarantee of legal liability where the drivers would pay on the basis of how much they would earn.
However, this device, which is tested, draws attention to road network designers because it does not use GPS and provides only limited amounts of information that are regularly stored using the modem.
"People will be more willing to go if you don't follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programmes, a number of major mistakes have been made.
There are a lot easier and less subtle ways to do this.
Projectors in Oregon are experimenting with the choice of drivers.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they shall not take any equipment and shall rather decide to pay the travel fee based on the average number of kilometres charged to all citizens of the State.
In other places, they hope that the general public will join this concept, if the device is more skilled, not less.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that would be equipped to pay charges in parking hours in order to provide security within the mileage and to collect information on the speed of other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic congestion.
"The motorists will be willing to join in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," says the city project document.
Some transport designers, however, would like to know whether all the discussion on payment in kilometres is not just a real problem.
Officials of the Metropolitical Transport Committee in San Francisco state that Congress could solve the problem with the Banked Railway Reinsurance Fund, which is very easy to solve by increasing gas tax.
A single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrids or other vehicles that do not need a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for any radical operation when wealth is enough to take aspirin," Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Public Affairs said.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their own privacy and a lot of other things.
For ČSSD, Sobotka will be escorted.
Social democracy is being torn apart, people and Babies are talking together and agreeing to a common procedure.
If social democracy prevails within a few weeks, they will sit at the same table with the perfect assembled partners, who are placed on the table on the ready list of requirements, including ministerial posts.
ČSSD is then released either by a total of acidic coalic hazards or by a causal minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days when he didn't get into a wild sympathy, first found him.
Last night he was not allowed to rule a political party, and he was mainly given a witness to a lie to be rejected.
Only he, the other members of the team, shall be authorised by the approved member on behalf of the party until the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (AIF).
I spoke to the members of the group and now also to the citizens.
There is no lie in personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michael Hashek, following the most recent leadership of social democracy.
He added that the President's position is not the same.
"I will send my decisions to the U.S.A. on 10 November," Hašek said.
Similarly, the chairman of ČSSD Zdeněk Škramoch and head of the delegation club Jerony Tejc spoke.
He also warned that he had been selected just two days ago.
The two Members then announced that they were doing everything to make the fifteenth ČSSD club vote.
"I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to her character and have respected the decisions of the foreign authorities."
They've heard more lies in direct transmission.
Or, perhaps, when calling on Sobot's resignation and his resignation from the executive team, he forgot that the Serbian SVV committed 57 per cent to the fact that Bohuslav Sobotka was a candidate of the party to the Prime Minister?
The head of the ČSSD made himself an enemy of the military until next week at the same time.
Its opponents have ten days to fill the 192 Members' e-mails of this body and media with the most diverse trees and fams, possibly reminding the Sobot political career of the real mistakes.
There will be a strong cracking of the spinal cord, the signs of the dark connections between the hummingbird of the Bali and the Sobot wing will appear.
A friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotky and the influential lawyer Radka Pokorný will be discussed.
They raise disputes in the South Sea or the ČSSD.
The words of the Ostrava Prime Minister and Sobotk's Consistency Petra Kinara are warning: "I signed Chart 77 so that the countries don't control the idols."
If the UVV had already met this weekend, liars would probably have been brought to the ritual sacrifice of their functions.
The traitors will take their heads off, and they will stay.
And the currently winning chief of ČSSD will then finish with the preview of Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on the problems with OH in Soci: Communication with Russia is mandatory
His mouth's mouth's indistinct smile, and then it's just deep out, "It's boring."
The collaboration with the organizational team of the Olympics in the summer of 2014 is slightly more complicated according to Martina Doctor.
We can forget about what happened on the past Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," said the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What's going on?
A lot of things work smaller and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of the invoice are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on basic matters not so far.
We need three months to get them to give us how to officially mark individual neighborhoods so that we can do the whole number of things.
We're still waiting and they're still saying they're communicating.
They're still communicating in a number of ways.
Is the Olympic Village already delivered?
But it's not a disaster situation anymore.
A month ago, we went to empty places.
Homes of luck are standing.
What do you mean they're empty?
Do you need any finished floors?
Only basic concrete, so that was the position of a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that we'll be there on January 26th as a prelude, it'll still feel nice there.
And if they don't make it, what will it be?
Mr. Putin would you think he'd take the army there?
That's exactly what's going to happen.
It's just that it's not that the Olympic Village = the tribal district.
They're probably afraid that they don't come up with, for example, to fix the road, they don't do the details.
Maybe they'll have the roads in a state that we're gonna have to take with us the Holins from the London Hills.
But I believe they're giving it to the buyer.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now they're 78, even though according to nominal criteria, the number has changed.
Maybe the Kraspors will eat the three that they ate.
No one should doubt Martini Sáblík's accelerator either, but otherwise it's in development.
Are you still waiting for a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there by Friday 26th.
We know how the houses in the Olympics will look.
We even measured some things by ourselves so that we don't just believe in plans.
We're also preparing a series of other things, including transport.
And what does the boss do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a regular agenda for communication with the organizational committee in Soci.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, his plan almost covered his secrets.
The fans of winter sports are already setting up a meter to start the Olympic Games in Sochi, and others are looking for more concerns.
The Russian Olympics, starting at the end of the season, are also having another scandal.
According to the Russians, it is impossible to fulfill the promise that the preparations and the rides will not even ruin the nature of the Krasnodar region in the wake of Kavkazu, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be killed.
Finally, after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high score, the Canadian Olympic games were recorded as the fastest in the environment.
It seems, however, that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to arrange games with a "nuol waste" has taken him a long time ago.
Reporters of the AP agency last week revealed a piece of building material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
Thus, the complex of building materials, pneumatics, canisters and insulation plants were already found in the Serbian ecological system, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities broke down and the club disappeared.
Just a minute.
Last week, the reporters were given a look at a three-foot photovoltaic score.
He's not the only one in the area of such places, he wrote the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian railway station, a state monopol, which is building a 40-kilometre road between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
The subcontractor, who has already co-located 280 billion rubles, led one of the closest Putin employees, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways were warned that one of the subcontractors was founded.
The locals are already promising.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, all of them have been traveling for three months and a night with full waste material.
According to experts, the waste is contaminated by the local river Mzymtu, other streams and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here is contaminated by the soybeans in the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimajev of the EWNC's organic non-ferrous organisation.
The illegal consequences are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison: the games in Soci will be $11 billion, while the annual Olympics in Beijing in 2008 went to 43 billion.
The London Games in London stood only 19 billion and the mentioned nine billion.
In addition to corrupt scandals, project maintenance and concerns, if there is enough snow at the end, reports have also revealed that human rights are not achieved at the exhibition of sports and infrastructures.
Last month, one of the workers went to the mouth to protest that he didn't get two months paid.
Many also fear how Russian organizers are dealing with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors seem to be Russian gays to support the Olympics.
A young couple looked at living with their parents, a new house offers private homes to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates has been designed to propose a house on the streets, which lies on two streets, where the only floor is sometimes covered.
The demand continued to include two generations who wanted to live together in the house, but then everyone should have their own clearly separated space.
The younger couple needed a little office.
The house stands on two streets and peacefully on the ground.
The architects therefore decided to move every household into one of the patters of the house.
"In the design of the proposal, we have respected the family ties, history and memories of this place."
"The three different functions of the house are several roads connected through the external object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but then they have their own characteristics," the designers explain.
The parental home is at the level of the garden with the old baroque, where family traditions and memories are considered.
The simple parts of the house are easily recognized outside, but they also make it easier for a different final fixation phase.
While the main segment of the building is concrete, its surface was constructed using panels from the corner, part where the office is located, the remaining cells remained in clean concrete operation without any further adjustments.
Many walls of the house are completely clean, thanks to which the interior of the house is very decorated with the outside.
The home of parents, more precise kitchen, food and shelter, includes a small garden with a tree that has great significance for the family.
The proposal for an interior with an outer wall supports the side wall, which starts on the edge and continues until the roof.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house by the main entrance to the hall and then walk through the stairs to their rooms.
Just the stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their structures allow them to pass through a lot of natural light through them.
That's why the architects tried to separate the house from the others and put something unique on it.
The home of the young couple is combined as one open room with kitchen, dining room and living room.
From the terrace, she's just building a beautiful wall with beautiful doors.
Living area with food and kitchen parts in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed of a large open space, which is free to go to the terrace, where it is a beautiful view of the Tokyo Treaty.
The unique office in the highest future is located in a clean combination of white and black colors.
The warehouse is the dominant first interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house at the main entrance, appear in the entrance hall, and then walk up to the roof.
Protect academic freedoms, pay for the land and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, pedagogues and high schools in a number of countries to defend academic freedoms before a voluntary campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman at school.
I met with more or less success.
The Directors of the Masaryk University in Brno, who rejected the presidential presidency of the SPOZ - Landanovci in the preamble period, have even received a similar invitation to the celebration of the Czech Republic's State party.
Here are a list of representatives of schools that have not been so state-owned and allowed the visit of Miloše Zeman: High Technical Education in Brno, Gymnasium Hladnov in Ostrava, High School of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolin, J.E. Purkyno University in Ustätä nad Labem.
We are now meeting in the Pardubic cities with the continuation of policy-making in high schools.
The new elected envoy for ODS, the Dekan Faculty of Electrotechniques and Computers of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and also seems normal to him.
Mr. Professor, it's really not the same as if you're staying for example in the care of a smaller city.
Do you want to join the Heatmans ČSSD, who perform the functions of the mission and the Heatmans at the same time as they degrade both calls?
That's what you're saying to those people that they're allowed to control both of these dedicated functions on the left.
I know, here's the example of Michala Hashka, who even manages several dozen functions simultaneously.
But it's probably not the exact example of the person you should run.
We will also find an excellent and good example of MUDr. French soldiers who would rather have left the post so that they could fully win the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason I recommend leaving Decan's function, however, is that during the course of this operation, you weaken the apolitical academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
Conducting Pardubic ODS sees your current action on both posts as a benefit to the University.
However, your "your" school will be able to help even without remaining grateful.
I think the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
Then consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may be told that your voters will count in the next elections.
And that doesn't have to be long.
In the Kunovic bubbles, chemicals don't belong to it
More than a thousand tons of cysan oil want to be produced in the coming months in Slovakia’s Fruit Kunovice, which belongs to the Food Group of Hamé.
The season here started in October, and it's about half a year ago.
Since 1925, health education has continued to be done in a traditional way, and it has been done directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times it's a rare thing.
Our workers will find a change of nearly ten-kilometre track.
To each of the ten tanks, up to five to thirty tons of iron, the completion of one takes three changes," said the director of the Slovak Fruit David Kladrab.
Heads of the wish to drive to the area of society directly from their fields of agriculture mainly from Austria and Brussels.
The staff of Fruity after the greenery cleans, removes the costumes and digs into the kitchen.
From here the already decorated greens fall into the pools of six-foot depth, where they work tirelessly in white clothes and hooligans.
That's where the cold air is coming out.
The last sesame species wants to cover the flat and water.
"The green cornea then appears six to eight weeks after spontaneous milk poisoning without any contributing to the pollutant," said Director Kladrab.
The proposed process corresponds to the production under domestic conditions, the individual types of workers benefit from salts and minerals.
She's on her way to the full line after she's done it.
It is wrapped in a sweetly-skinned needle into the syringes or syringes and the sterilizer is spread.
Hamé is providing oxygen for the Turkish and Slovenian markets in particular.
He is also interested in it in some other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in connection with monitoring from the USA
Edward Snowden, a researcher from the U.S. intelligence services, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to give the German parliament evidence if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander would not be able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
The German Ambassador Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was appointed as an assistant, and talked with him about the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, who delivered the press on Friday in Berlin, he stated: “Since the outcome of my efforts has been very positive, the government has continued to deal with opposition as a result and attempts to criminalize political proceedings with serious complaints that do not provide room for defense."
Speaking the truth, however, is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the Government of the United States to be accused of criminal acts against him.
The charges raised by the Ministry of Justice of the United States include spy and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to the German officials, we will find a way to do this."
The tension between the United States and Germany began to mount when it was claimed that the NSA was listening to Angely Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament, who is leading the parliamentary panel, which looks at the report, said that if there were any opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "not to be dangerous and to destroy all relations with the United States," it should be done.
Mr Ströbele, a Member of Parliament, on the German side of the Greens, published his Twitter photo contribution to Mr Snowden.
On her way to Russia, two German journalists introduced her.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to the former law firm, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to witness in Germany, he would need to make sure that he would be "safe," said a member of Parliament.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he was driving a vicious and persistent campaign associated with the persecution that led him to leave his home.
He said, however, that the reaction of the whole world to his “political expression act” gave him a hint.
Citizens of the whole and senior officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the existence of an uninitiated public service monitoring system.
The letter includes the offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "that the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved."
Killing us is hate, but we're innocent.
Nuon Chea was a number two in the Rudý Khammer hierarchy and Khieu Samphan was the former head of state.
The government of the Rudý Khammer, which was officially embroiled in Maoism and Nationalism between 1975 and 1979, came about life as a result of drought, hunger, disability, torture and correction of more than three million Cambodians, thus at least one quarter of the population is more than that.
This was the result of the infamous execution of the S-21 prison in 2010 of the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, torture and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are proud to believe that they are in the best interests of the people and do not know what the real scope of killing is.
"It's easy to say that I should know everything, understand everything and then touch and fix the situation," Khieu Samphan announced on Thursday before the court.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no right," he added.
Nuon Chea pointed out that he never ordered the Red Khmer Frames to "mand the people wrong or kill them to destroy their food or to destroy the genocide."
But he recognized the "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victim, their families, to all Cambodian people," he said.
Five-year-old Bin Sivla, who came through the Rudý Khmero regime for eleven visits, the AFP agency said he can't accept an apology to Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"Only wants to be released from guilt."
"There will be no second," she declared.
"If he didn't give orders, his subterfuge wouldn't kill," he added, adding that the leaders of the Rudy Khmer are "more than a monster."
Before the trial, he was also the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Rudý Khmeró Ieng Sary regime, who died this year in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, a former minister of social affairs, in September 2012 the court pursued an incompetence process for dementia.
The leader of the Rudý Khammer Paul Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is willing to pay for manual equipment
Frontier Airlines plans to calculate the amount of up to 100 USD for the installation of the manual fuel on the deck during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 USD for a handbag and 2 USD for a coffee or juice, although they said in their notice in the middle that the passengers would be able to leave their entire trailer.
The new fee for the hand-held is related to the plant in the upper office area, so the small plant will continue to be free under the seat.
Frontier company says it will account for $25 if the fee is paid in advance and $100 if they are traveling with payment until they arrive at the branch.
Fortier Kate O'Malley's speech company indicated that the stemlar fee has to be uplifted in order to advance the payment.
"Now we would choose this fee," she said.
The airlines began to pay the first and second charges in 2008.
Travelers tried to avoid these fees and threw them into the handbags stored in the office area as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this area.
Payments are one of the ways to learn how to carry less things on the deck.
O'Malley said that the idea of this new payment is really not to get more money.
This is because the most reliable customers of Frontier's company have made it quite clear that finding a place in the top office space is still more difficult.
Travellers who buy flights on the websites of companies will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier can bring a loan that he does not pay, while the other passenger in front of the same loan will pay 100 USD.
O'Malley said that the website and recovery procedures will be adjusted to ensure that the traveler knows before coming to the defense.
The new Frontier company fee for the manual loan will not yet be available before the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Travellers often spend money on entertainment and other charges, but airlines love it.
He claims that the manipulatives are money, and travelers who require this service to be paid for it.
Many on Wall Street take another charge for the event as a sign that airlines are trying to choose a sufficient amount of money to cover the cost of air transport after years.
But most of them didn't have to pay for handcuffs.
Spirit Airlines, as the first to pay off the handholds three years ago, and another low-cost Allegian Air company, followed her example later.
The only company that also has such charges is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the fee for the management of the Spirit company would be $50 million a year.
Sorensen, former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew to Spirit company and was excited about what he saw in the yard when traveling to meet with the extraordinary fee of the Spiritic company for a hand-made venture.
"The approach to the plane was the most exciting thing I've ever seen in my flight career," he said.
I've been waiting to see the toothpaste and the hooks in the yard.
The plane was full, he said, "and the approach went into the meat."
Frontier also after the example of the company Spirit uses coffee, tea, juice and juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who will get lemonade or juice can leave the whole bottle and the coffee will be filled free.
The water will continue to be released.
In 2008, U.S. Airways recently tried to impose drinking taxes, but after seven months of travel, no other significant airline appeared.
The last of these companies, Frontier, to pay a handhold if the traveler does not buy a flight directly from this airlines, is its last effort to direct customers directly to its website.
The airlines pay for Internet travel sales, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD per flight.
This has enabled all airlines to take passengers directly from them instead of doing so through Internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier's company has just gone into this area.
In September it started to give customers who bought via the Internet travel agency only half a mile under the trust program.
In the mid-term, the compensation for the claimed mile to 25 per cent miles from the given route.
So the road company Frontier has a distance of 1,000 miles purchased via the Internet travel agency means a 250-mile discount.
Customers also allow the company to choose its seat in advance only if they purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier's company has a reliable customer base in his home city of Denver, but her business starts to die and lose money.
According to the financial results reported in the average company partner Republic Airways Holdings, the market decreased by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The company of the Republic seeks to address the legal and financial problems of Frontier.
The NASA website does not condemn hackers, but "internal error"
The National Security Agency announced last Friday that its website for several hours last week fell because of internal error, never because of hackers, as some have claimed on the Internet.
"NSA.gov's strangers have not been available for a few hours tonight due to internal error which occurred during regular updates," the spy agency stated in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be eliminated during tonight.
The claim that the incident was caused by a DDOS attack (distributed refusal of service) is not valid.
Earlier this evening online photographers reported that NSA websites have not worked for at least six hours, and sites are still unavailable for some users.
Previously, NSA spokesman ABC News reported that the internal sensitive network of agencies had not been "never" threatened.
The speaker said no hidden information is at stake.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed that it is responsible for sorting the NSA site through DDOS attack.
DDoS routes are designed to allow the target web pages to be filled with information until the server is unsustained and the site is unsustained.
This cybernetic tactic is relatively simple and the meaning of attacks does not lead to the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA supertina agency, who once received a review of no such agency, has been behind the scenes of foreign and domestic monitoring programmes through public attention and with the aim of counter-critiques including the identification of NSA files from the agency and their expression by former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency led to an earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of cybernetic operations.
The profit of Bombardier’s company was lost due to the decrease in supply and order
The Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier announced on Thursday a 50 per cent reduction in the net profit resulting from the lower number of orders and delivery of the aircraft in the third quarter and the contractual problems in the train unit.
The company Bombardier also did not disclose any data on the flight test for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer any relevant information on whether this aircraft will achieve an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next summer.
After the exciting test flight about a month and a half ago, only three times and the question arose whether the test phase was going well.
The results have not been completed and the stock on the tower in Toronto dropped by 8 per cent.
The state bank analysis Cameron Doersken reduced in the fourth rating from "high-quality" to "external sector" with the expectation that the bridge will enjoy limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"While the less supplies of the aircraft were expected most, the profit margin in the transport area made us very clear," Doersken reported to customers.
As the pilot programme continues, we believe that Bombardier's company will get new orders from CSeries.
However, if there are no new orders in the coming months, we assume that market disputes are growing against this programme.
Bombardier's company hopes that CSeries' aircraft are headed to the bottom of the market, which now dominates Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was released in March, and after a few months of delay, the first flight was launched in September.
However, the number of mandatory orders for CSeries reached a minimum of 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the pilot flight to verify the company's claims regarding low consumption and support for the costs of this transport aircraft.
At present, there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected the company to achieve its 300 binding orders when introducing the first aircraft to commercial use.
The managers also assured on Thursday that the program was working according to the plan.
"The pilot aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin in a conference talk and noted that the country-wide and software updates were planned during the departure of the aircraft.
Every manufacturer plans it differently.
We decided to finish the first year and then focus on updating and we did.
This will happen during the entire flight programme.
According to Bombardier, two of the five pilots should be aired in the coming weeks and the other weeks after.
The analysts are still skeptical about the fact that the first customer could start operating CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
The company Bombardier claims that it assessed its flight introduction plan and provided updated information in the following months.
"This slow pace of flight tests – although it is in line with Bombardier's internal plan – will obviously strengthen our view that the entry into service will be based on the first quarter of 2015,” Doerssen said.
Of the 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share in the previous year, at the end of the third quarter of September 30, the net profits of Bombardier's company fell to 147 million dollars, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted results for one share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The deal was marginally reduced from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
According to the IBES system of Thomson Reuters, analysts expected 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest producer of the aircraft indicated that the sales of 57 aircraft a year earlier added only 45 aircraft during that quarter.
Pure orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Non-compliance with the air traffic regulations constituted 32.9 billion on 30 September, which does not change even on 31 December.
"The results in the airport were in accordance with our views, but the low acceptance of the order and the overall market position have weakened us," said Beaudoin.
Exports in the aviation industry amounted to 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, pointed out that the profit in this division increased by about 11 per cent to 2.1 billion dollars.
Failure to comply with the requirements set out in the Act amounted to 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September, resulting in the loss of 31 December of marginal growth.
The success of the transport division had been affected by problems with the implementation of several major contracts.
The managers indicated that new views would be provided in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, who also announced the arrival of the financial director of Google Patrick Pichette, decreased by 8.5 per cent on Thursday at the value of 4.83 USD.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor of Bombardier, announced a 10% fall in the fourth year.
A lawyer dependent on cocaine that warned mafia against police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) had to provide information to the king of the world of Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid that his drug addiction would be revealed.
The Liverpool Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A spy prosecutor who informed the drug mafia of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would be discovered, he was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had, after being suspected of using cocaine, chief of Neil Scarbrough's subworld to provide sensitive information on his drug-related activities.
The lawyer whose review was “Bash” (part) and who was celebrated as the best legal representative was after the police surveillance of Scarborough, who was arrested in 2011 in previous drug-related proceedings.
The police watched Sarborough (32) as he left in a lawyer's house in Blackburn in Lancashire, which was right at dinner with his colleagues from Law firm, three cupcakes with cocaine.
On the basis of a test where cocaine was found in his hair, his money and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Dita was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain information on two men arrests in support of Scarborough and its companion.
All four suspects were monitored at that time in the framework of a large investigation of heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After holding heroin and cocaine at a value of approximately 1.5 million GBP plus 200 000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison with the police.
Dita (42) provided information to criminals for fear that he would come to rely on cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works in Forbes Solicitors' legal society with his seat in Blackburn, lived a long time before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was pursued by a criminal because in two cases he defended justice.
During the previous hearing, he agreed to hold the cocaine.
The lawyer's case came after a police investigation in Scarborough found that he was in regular telephone contact with Dinto in August 2011.
Two suspects were watching, recording his entry to Ditt's house, and watching him put drugs of 60 percent under the lawns in a black golf course.
Next was Scarborough with Ditto, who was at the football stadium Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where he found drugs, and nine conversations took place between the two persons.
The court found that the drugs of Class A were found in his hair, money, and on his credit cards and that Dita was “regular user” cocaine.
Dita was later arrested, but her use of cocaine deteriorated, and he said that he spoke to the suspect dealer because he was his client and argued that their conversation was part of a "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Dita took his money and tried to extract several credit cards from it, but all were held and his hair samples were collected.
At the police hearing, he said he was running an office both at his home and at his place of work and that his clients also visited him because of his work concerns.
However, the court has heard that after key arrests, he contacted a significant player in a drug supply chain, some of which had previously been introduced to tell them what he knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who knows better than anyone else that they should not violate the law than the legal representatives in the criminal field.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of using his position as a legal representative and of getting too close to a specific client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who uses his own lawyer's drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the common relationship of a lawyer-client.
The police investigation carried out as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr. Dieta didn't bring the good news to his professor, but he destroyed it.
He drew too close to certain customers, especially Scarborough, and allowed himself to be damaged by his independence.
Ditta refused the violation and declared: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who is not my own, and I would like to give Mr. Scarborough information, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: "Mr. Dinta became a criminal himself at the time he started taking drugs from organised criminals."
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the objectives of the previous representatives of the organised crime group, who commissioned him to collect valuable information on police investigation.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of non-compliance and should publicly build confidence and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Dieta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his professor's plate.
The unit for serious and organised criminal acts in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr. Ditto, on which he was also sentenced for three cases of cocaine detention and now for the defence of justice, which demonstrates our obligation to bring a crime before the court.
This case should serve all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and put you in front of our court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison, after which he was declared guilty of cooperation for the purpose of providing heroin, cocaine and cocaine.
The next thirty-five persons involved in trafficking were arrested for a total of 153 years for drug abuse.
On its Dita website, he arranged an online conversation in which he said that his explicit work would be legally representing clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner he would invite Mohamed Aliho and as a motivation for his work.
He was in charge of the government with Klaus and Špidlo.
Now the people of Jan Casal have sent them against Babish.
The people received only a third of the number of social Democrats or representatives of the UN in the elections.
However, they enter at least one benefit for the government.
In the team that has already begun to take pictures of possible coalica, Jan Kasala - men, who were flying the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats or Andrej Babish have no such matador on their side.
It is likely this time to remember the first presentation in 1992, when ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experimental experiences have been minimal," Kasal suggests how the annual talks will be developed.
Kenyan press against the Media Competition Act
"It is a terrible report and it is in place to ask what Parliament will prevent in order to simply not create the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the press quoted as a draft anti-civil law.
"This law is precise and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, director-general of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most prominent independent polling stations and reporting sites.
He said that the new media court "will always be expected because it is extended by the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to Star, the government's proposal actually provides "full control over the media" and the Standard states that democracy and freedom are "sustaining a hard morning" and criticises the proposal as "sound".
The adoption of the legislative proposal comes at the centre of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the Israeli shooting at the Westgate shopping center.
The anger of the authorities turned the Kenyan media into a record of security cameras on which the soldiers sent to the site of the attack deliberately engaged in trade with luxury goods.
The police officer responded by letting two journalists and a leading media officer go to the hearing, but the hearing was delayed after the press was printed.
According to the new proposal of the Law, media companies may be subjected to up to 20 million Kenyan frauds and individual journalists up to one million with the risk of "recording from the list" or official press accreditation.
The Court shall also have the right to enjoy the property of the defendant if the trial is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single attempt is enough to break most of the voting stations. ”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidity impact on what is called the Kenyan "living bloc".
Politicians know that when they shut down the media, they can do whatever they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote a journalist to the National Mutum Mathie newspaper and described the Kenyan media as a key source of the system of mutual control and exportation in public life.
"If we leave it to politics, the country will bring us back to the bunker and raise us back to the hunt and assembly," he wrote.
The lawmakers in Kenya have been in the past in terms of public criticism.
In May, they voted in favour of the destruction of the national flagship agency established and the restoration of their debt payments of approximately 532,000 undisputed coins, which are so ordered to be the highest in the world.
He's got to calm down, he knows young Czechs.
Most of them, but they don't even match any levels.
She's still giving more money to the Czechs.
However, they do not meet the competition campaigns in the region.
The most money on the other hand is spent on the Lakuchan, who spends a month on average 181 euros.
There's more to Cheši than people in Slovenia.
This results from a study of the group of Erste Savings Barometers in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the Board of Directors is improving and two thirds of the respondents are planning to spend more money on the other side.
While Czechs are a mess between the strikers' hives, in Romania and in Serbia, the combined products still use very little.
For example, almost every other Serb, according to the survey, is home to "under the police".
In the autumn of this year, the number of people who earn more than a month.
Still, each month for the most diverse kind of competition, thousands of up to 2.5 thousand rounds of 26 per cent of respondents, this year is about five per cent more.
The average monthly position in the mid-year comparison, but was slightly down to 2078.
The highest rate of exposure between the products is pension insurance.
This represents 54 per cent of the Czechs, while only 36 per cent of the people considered the most popular way of measuring support three years ago.
On the contrary, the structure of the dispute was close, and last year the interest in the investment fund was also significantly lost.
You're using only 16 percent of the respondents, while last year it was about a quarter of the people.
The study also showed that although people consider it important to feed, most of them do not know the results of individual products.
In the past 30 years, young people don't know how their money is spent.
On the contrary, the best information about the worth of your money is the oldest group of people who have been asked, among people over 50 years of age, is 73 percent of those who have been asked.
In international comparisons, the group of Erste Češi leads to the use of online banking, which regularly employs 44 per cent of people.
The following are Slovaks and Raccoon with 12 percent discount.
The UN celebrates new goals of fighting poverty
The organization of the United Nations begins to work independently on a new target file that restores the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that have been set up 12 years ago for the purpose of organizing the world's poverty.
Before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which started in Rio de Janeiro during the night, Australia played a key role in implementing the "Sustainable Development Goals" that are to be rewarded by MDG, whose salary rises in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document approved by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
OSN Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said during the night at the summit that now is the time to “take a stand for national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take the process to achieve the overall objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDG will be a step forward that has been achieved in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the development programme by 2015.
I am putting forth every effort to fulfil my mandate to the Member States and to carry out our vision of sustainable development goals that will lead to the success of MDG.
The security concerns of Mozambique are raised due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the shadow of Samory Machely, the Mosambican Vice President, thousands of people met in the center of Maputa to celebrate peaceful public demonstrations.
"We want peace again; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, the executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed her business clothes for a three-year-old letter “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined in the dedication on Thursday to the City of Independence in the main city.
Two weeks later, almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo side, one of the worst developments since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notoriously notorious rival gang, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa under the dreams of destabilization of the independent government of this country.
After the peace agreement in 1992 it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict would again arise in the country, but recent developments have suggested foreign investors and locals.
The economy is rapidly growing, because the appearance of vast coastal reserves of oil and coal in the north-west can take over the next few years from the company, such as the Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, Italian Eni and American Anadarko, investment in value of more than $50 billion.
The ruling party of Frelimo, dominant political forces since 1975, and Renamo is accused of being motivated by jealousy.
The Renamo side claims that the government has raised the last conflict by launching an attack on its members on 17 September in the province of Sofala, the traditional village of the Party of Renamo.
The violent attacks of former rebels subsequently resulted when the government forces attacked on the basis of the Renamo side and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said for the Financial Times, the spokesman of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government blames for the outbreak of the Renamo conflict, because he was attacked by the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuz has been trying to calm down the instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office AFP said in the middle that Mr. Dhlaka had seen himself as a "costant" who wanted to use "any remaining power to prove that the government could make its own decisions".
Like Frelimo, Renamo says they want to avoid war.
However, the fears grew when Mr. Mazangy’s words were quoted that the Renamo party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
A letter from the FT said he thought Frelimo's party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the meeting, but with dignity," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between these parties have led to a reduction in the pressure between these parties, which has been reduced by a series of flows this year, only a few.
It is a joke between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakam), said a lecturer at the Open University and an expert at Mozambique's Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good publisher and not one of them is prepared to take the necessary steps.
The Renamo side, which was beginning to change the electoral system, has already declared that it would fight the municipal elections planned for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as a force for reducing the burden of profit and financial burden from the government.
The voluntary share of Renamo has decreased since 1992, while the newest party, the Democratic Party of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, whose second working period will end next year, wants to destroy democracy in this country.
"They don't want a democratic system anymore, they don't want transparent elections, they don't want peace, because they don't want to leave the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It's unclear what the Renamo side has, but he's been carrying out violent terrorist attacks on the police station and on vehicles on the key road between the north and theirs.
The main route came to the province of Sofala, a few hundred miles away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira is located, the port to which the sub-corporate companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are located on the island.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for about a week, when the Renamo side threatened to compete on this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to explain to you whether Renamo is in danger.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration of government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media companies Mediacoop, and many people also have concerns about corruption, the short term of development and the recent floods of floods.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is not entirely the government and the president and that he should be the one who can solve the problems," he says.
Democrat Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"No one is interested in either Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the train," he says.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for the way of life”, says the author.
The experiences of Thor can show that “the grave power cannot equal the intelligence of the lstivist, ” while Artusian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myth would "for school education, it would be too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too extensive," said Crossley-Holland, who agrees to make a thorough choice of work for the age concerned.
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I got this plan after twenty years.
He added that the "open teachers" authors and teachers are in plain stories with the "subscriber" message for children as a "principle".
Crossley-Holland, who translated from English the Epos Beowulf and who also writes the Norwegian Mothers (Penguin Book) and the British National Girls, says: “You can have a good idea, but you can do better if you leave them for yourself.”
Perhaps the greatest difference between the adult author's letters for adults and the adult author's letters for children is the need for a sense of hope.
It may not be that everything must be simplified or completed by the Happy, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil there.
And he shall be informed of it, and he shall be informed of it, and he shall not be made to speak openly.
The old truth is it's better to show it than to write.
The Brnik Star takes visitors to the universe in the new digital world
At first glance, it is evident that the size of the planetary has changed in the last half of the year.
There's a new park here, visitors can hide in new comfortable seats, and over their heads, the project site came about 17 feet [17 m] in the shape of a hole from an American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order to make the picture perfect, there are even fewer designers on the floor.
Another important part of the whole device is hidden behind the soul wall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate a picture," said the Bronze Star Director Jiří Dušek.
The computer will ensure that the image from a few projectors is not broken, but gives a complete mind.
"The power of computers is thirty-four times higher than in classic personal computers," said the astronomer Tomáš Hladík.
The digital system will be able to test both realistic and plastic models of night conditions, human body or ocean.
They're so excited right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar device is the closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
Star control plans in the living room to promote the order and the design of its own.
Since Saturday, there's two orders on the program.
His first name is Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it people learn about cosmonaut training, travel to the universe, compete on the centrifuge, and then see how amazing the conditions of the astronomer in the space are.
The second order is for children and has the name Kouzelni tites - Kaluoka'hin.
He tells the story of an earthquake that the pessimists lived in a quiet life until the moment a small earthquake struck.
The entire range of the digital has stood at a total of tens of millions of crowns, which paid the school's ministry too much.
Less than half of them also contributed to the city of Brno and the star from its budget.
The project space was ten million kroner, the projector twelve million.
"The rest of the audiovisual technology and computers," explained the Dušek.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the star went through two years ago.
According to Director Duchka, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could still be reached by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 TIZIC INZERÁT!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis took over 11 thousand interns offering jobs, 4300 of which were posted in daily printing and 6800 interns (62 per cent) on the Internet.
The Internet is thus becoming the most prominent media to publish employment offer.
In 2005, when the study was first conducted, it was 26 per cent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), 60 per cent was established.
Inserts of job opportunities in themselves, according to the analysis, significantly reflect the current situation on the labour market.
For example, a simple comparison can be made between the number of registered investors in the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 there were approximately 25,900 investors in the same period, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of working positions on the Internet is focused on the interest, especially on a more qualified professional group.
On the contrary, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wide range of professions, including those of the departments, introduced the author of the analysis of Pavlín Läästantnová.
The rate of representation of selected professional groups varies between the two media.
On the Internet, the former sites were occupied by the searchers and leading workers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or leading small businesses was only on the Internet.
In daily printing, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, but the large representation is especially responsible and professional.
Of course, among the most frequently mentioned requirements expressed by employees by means of tenders are education.
The knowledge of foreign languages, especially English, was shared in the next followed area.
In daily printing, the demand for the knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent of the ads, on the internet at 37 percent.
Only in two per cent of the employees requested active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The comments on 'digital graffiti' appeared in 40 per cent of the ads (in daily print 11 per cent, on the Internet 57 per cent).
Praxe in the area was required in 54 per cent of the population.
The requirements for practice are closely related to qualified professions.
It's particularly about leading production and other leading workers.
In the field professions, in particular the mechanics and repairers, or the manufacturer and processors of food products or the repair of electrical equipment, the author of the study Jiří Tillner added.
Employees shall also apply to the property and expertise of their investors.
As the most often required skill in the first place, communication skills are already manifested in the first place for a long time.
Further employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organizational capacity and coherence.
Ben Greenman: tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that New York City is a place where the American solar chemical explosion was born: nearly a century ago the various artist Frank Fray, who worked as the president of the offices at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began telling the assembled people about the method of conversation.
Fayo's innovation has grown over the years, the latest through the New York comedy festival.
The festival, founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the solo comedy Carolinas, celebrates its tenth anniversary – along with more than fifty presentations in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolinas and became successful in the sense that they are too big to play in the club," said Hirschová.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
The annual event includes the exhibition of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mahera, as well as the “Stand Up for Heroes”, each year’s musical comedian performances in Madison Square Garden, which includes the performance of Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival expanded, so did the comedy world.
A number of comics from the annual festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows in less advertising or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll grew up in his seat (the famous "League" on a fantastic-photoball theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy Central station.
Jenny Slate was a member of the "Saturday night live" program, as well as "Parks and recreation", but she was very quick to praise the wide series of videos "Marcel the shell with shots on".
Like Kroll, and Slate, as well as other young commissions with clearly recognized voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, traveling, racially targeted W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest events of the festival will be the conversation: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comedy, but he became a successful television and film director, as well as an informal history comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he organized a TV show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held in Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedian DNA all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, sometimes he's going through a street between two buildings and says, "Man, if I come here for all the money, I might live here."
The price of roses went on to $96 for the barl
On Friday, the price of roses continued to reflect the high demand concerns of the report, which showed the strengthening of the Chinese industry's energy-based wage sector.
The U.S. Red Indicator for Prosin Delivery During the afternoon morning, the European electronic trade in New York’s trading bridge was 14 cents for $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, the drop was 39 cents and the monthly wage was 5.8 percent.
The rich stocks of roses in the past few weeks have weighed down the price.
The Ministry of Energy in the Middle East reported that US stocks increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production came up to a larger questionnaire showing growth in activity.
This means that China's economic legislation, which continued to grow after the last two bad decades, could continue to increase by 7.8 per cent in the third quarter.
Ropa Brent, an indicator for international scrap also used by American refineries, fell at the International Trade Exchange in London at 26 cents at $108.58 per barrel.
Well, no, Mr. Hasck.
We have the only way to show politicians that they don't.
It is necessary to make such pressure so that Martin Haszek is free of all political functions and has abandoned the mission.
Any other solution reduces the level of political culture that is already so mixed.
Martin Haszek is protected by the promises he made, but everyone and politics must be especially aware of the consequences of that promise and be very concerned about what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that has a policy (Mr. Babies has the weight, it is also the question whether it is a policy).
The worse the program is being told by a liar is unbelievable.
It doesn't fit in politics, it doesn't change in politics.
Mr. Hašku, if you think it's good with this country (and your frequent announcements of me in this, if you don't exactly do it - here you see how lying it is arranged), you will leave politics alone as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of the man who made a mistake and did not take responsibility for it.
In the wrong case, you will be regarded as a helpless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You want to be proud to be a missing person or a life jacket.
Maybe you think it's unfair when I'm talking only to you, but you're the opposite leader and they're just mistaken sheep.
And you're the leader and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you're trying to shut your ears for a moment now, get your strengths over, sit down here and hang up again, but that's what the parties or the suspects do.
You're, I repeat, in your eyes, the leader, the alpha alone, so act.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The Court blocked the regulation concerning the procedure for arrest and search of persons by the police department in NY
On Thursday, the Federal Appeals Court blocked the judicial regulation requiring changes in the arrest and search programme of persons at the police department in New York and dismissed the court from the case.
The second US court of appeal said that the decision of Judge Shiry Scheindlin will be postponed until the decision on the appeal issued by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its programme of establishment and demand for people.
Instead of its conclusions and its corrections, the decision to assign a review which would help the police department to modify its procedures and the school programme associated with them.
The Court of Appeal has heard in the oral arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeal court said that the court had to be dismissed from the case because it had reached a conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, and that as the judge did not agree with the request to refrain from the proceedings, in part because of the series of discussions with the media and the public statements that were openly responding to the court’s criticism.
The court decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they were unjustly targeted at the Blacks and Hispanes under their programme of arrest and search for persons.
It established an independent assessment to take into account major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and monitoring, and to organise the launch of a pilot programme for the testing of cameras carried on the body in certain areas where the most frequently occurring person is stopped.
In August New York City announced the completion of the name and address of the people whose cases were suspended after the police inspection.
The oral reason for calling the city is sometimes planned after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of establishment and search of persons have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
In a certain form, there is the establishment and search of persons for a number of decades already, but recorded visits under the management of independent elderly Michael Bloomberg were dramatically grown at record number 684 330 in 2011, mostly in the Black and Hispan.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to a minority, filed a complaint that occurred in the case of a group complaint.
The rest of the amendments to the establishment and monitoring programme by the police department in NY claim that the changes will end unjust practices, increase the reliability and effectiveness of the police force and may affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opposers claim that changes reduce police morality, but not crime, and that they spend money on it, but do not raise the problem when the police force is under pressure after the last decade, which has reduced its number of thousands of people.
The judge noted that she did not complete the practice of establishing and looking for a person who is constitutional but reformed the way the police department's surveillance in NY has been conducted.
The 5 shopping centers meet with low attendance
This is derived from the information provided by the real consultancy companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the Prague Bohniči public is open to the commercial centre Krakov, it will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
In the Czech Republic, there are now about 90 major commercial centers.
The unsatisfying performance concerns approximately 20 per cent of large and large centres.
The main problems are insufficiently large centre against the local and bad layout, so too much patter or complicated and unsightly fit, possibly dead centre," Michael Sotak of the Cushman & Wakefield company pointed out.
According to the leading retail estate division of Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five commercial centres travel with low visits.
Among the main reasons are the poor transport availability, low acceptance categories of local citizens or market resuscitation in the given place.
Some projects have opened almost completely covered, but their results have been particularly disturbing at first.
Today, customers are sometimes conservative and do not change their purchasing habits.
The new business centre must try to 'lakat' its customers on new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing," Samadi added.
The volume of shopping centres is generally stable, even in some centres, because the finders were willing to drop out of the rent and acquire some units in the crisis.
"But it is true that in recent times some projects that are not fully covered and medium-sized have been so reduced (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opavia, Shantovka in Olomouci) have been opened," Sotak added.
The commercial centre opened in the last two years is on the market, according to Sylvie Samadi very little.
A place on the market for new projects, but there is.
The number of places suitable for the construction of the successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a building space for a project that would serve the people of Prague 6.
On the market, there is certainly a space for the construction of smaller local projects, such as 'convinience centres', intended for purchases and services of daily needs for citizens living in the medium-term environment," said Samadi.
According to the Sotak, there is also a place in the foreign market for another shopping centre.
And it's like for a small 'service' centre, both for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Citys like Kladno, Czech Buddhist, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Sotak added.
In Prague, you can see a space for a commercial centre prepared at the Vitsítskát, where you can see a clear potential of the street in Příkopé and Václavska.
"Intensibly, the expansion of parks that allow traders to cover and spread to even smaller cities for affordable rental and operating costs is also in some locations for less local or residential shopping centres, in relation to their reconstruction such as the reconstruction of priority stores that are difficult from good location," Dita Kubánková from DTZ added.
At present, 90 modern shopping centers have been located in Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million metres of square root area.
The fourth of all these shopping centers is located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of customers, nine are in Prague, resulting from the data from the Incoma GfK company.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is within the EU, compared with the values from Britain and France, leaving Czech Republic about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson turned to the phone to check the guy.
Former editor of the news of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson used the methods “to call, monitor and face” to confirm a double-type of a kind relationship that should be connected by the next Minister inside Charles Clarke.
State representative Andrew Edis in the Old Bailey court said that the news of the World received false news in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "appropriate special advice" by Hannah Pawlby.
The press entrusted private investigator Glenna Mulcaaire with a request to turn to Paulby's vote and enter into her own case, but it was found in court that Coulson called her and left her a voice message.
"The state representative points out that Mr Coulson, who is now editor NotW, is not a man who stands at home and hopes that people will be caught outside, but a man who likes to tell people stories to see what they're saying," said Edis.
He said that the News NotW used three ways of researching stories: turning to the phone, monitoring and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Of course he knows about the second, watching, he needs to know about her.
And what's the first thing?
Do you know about getting in the phone?
He says no, we say, "But I'm sure he knows."
The friendly relationship that Clarke was involved was first invited by a news report department NotW, when the source that had been sexually interested in Mrs. Paulby was said: “Because you spend time with Charles.”
A record of the votes received from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained in Mulcairo's home in August 2006.
The investigators also found records in the computer of a private investigator, where Mrs. Paulby and her sister were designated as “Projects”.
During the time Mrs. Pawlby's investigation, her relatives received anonymous telephone calls asking for information about Pawlby, said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherap took note of Mrs. Pawlby's move.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, in which he told her: “I have come up with a story that we are going to talk about tomorrow and which I would like to talk to Charles very much. ”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in history was based on the same model as in other significant personalities, including former Prime Minister David Blunkett.
In court on Thursday, Coulson admitted that Mr. Blunketta had been confronted by a merciful relationship with his wife, while he himself met with the guilty Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks announced their association with other persons for telephone calls between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup agreed to call.
Dissemination of NSA enhances the social monitoring of the state
One day at the end of August, a German police guard fired at the American consular office in Frankfurt, the main German economy.
The purpose of the mission was to organize photographs of U.S. shootings, which are located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claim that the BfV Authority hoped that it would be able to identify the presence of the obedient antennas, and this action put an exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of the U.S. National Report, once again stressed that the United States does not use its foreign reporting opportunities, "to steal foreign companies' business secrets in favour of American companies and to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, who became a co-workers, has begun to withdraw his valuable collection from the secret monitoring of the United States, European governments and former entrepreneurs no longer know if they should trust the words of the Director.
According to reports that the U.S. National Security Agency carried out spying in Brazil's mining company and obtained access to data from American cloud suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, obtained a general paranoia on monitoring new dimensions.
The last chapter came with the impression that Angely Merkel's cell phone might have been answered ten years ago.
If it is possible to be the most powerful person in Europe, they are certainly the potential runners and the former entrepreneurs.
Snowden examined intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that this data is used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a study published in July by the EC Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that the United States is now at the same risk as China when it comes to industrial spying and stealing data.
However, there is no evidence in the whole of Mr Snowden's document, however, that the United States has handed over the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain skills in the field of IT and the Internet and indicated that it should try to limit its dependence on the USA:
The former entrepreneurs are skeptical about this.
The German parliament calls for the vote that we should make the German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open it a little bit...
This is not a road, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he didn't have to let him die 20 years ago.
Everything is done in Germany, from coal by car and farmer.
Everything except the IT industry.
The expansion and technical progress of the American spy agency Snowdenem, which has recently been thought to represent China's greatest threat of monitoring, is still shocking.
There is a great deal of business in a cloud-based accounting technology where European representatives in a wider range have found that data posted in the USA fall under the dark jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study carried out by Cloud security alliance around 10 per cent of non-American members following the release of the USA Prism data programme, the plan to use a cloud supplier with a seat in the USA has been cancelled.
Jim Snabe, one of the General Directors of the SAP, says: “We have a new question for customers who haven’t been here a year ago - where are my data posted and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German seniors argue that the latest reports are merely confirmations of what they already knew: that strong states want to clear their most valuable secrets and that this data must be protected at every price.
It's not surprising that there's an economic spy taking place.
He always did.
"It's a basic theme for many years and has not changed much even during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the Agrochemical Society of BASF.
The Americans are doing spying on us at trade and industry level, as we are doing spying on them, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Subsidy leaders generally do not want to interfere with the countermeasures they have taken to prevent the beneficiaries from doing so, where appropriate.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking on a free USB drive or leaving unprotected notebook in the hotel room is minimally unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Car Presentation, says that it has been a practice to gather before the Mobile Phone Meeting for many years so that it is not possible to use it as a listening device.
The German Office of BfV advises leading workers to consider whether to use mobile phones on foreign routes simply because of the risk that smart phones can be accessed.
Prepaid mobile phones will be released.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies have represented the global market in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised access," he warns in his report BfV.
The United States protects its own companies against economic spying from other countries.
According to the Washington post-American document National Intelligence Estimate, France's forum with Russia and Israel included a second set of partners who engage in hacker activities for economic reporting, which is now for China.
A member of the Council of the German without risk-free company concluded that in terms of economic spy, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Internal Reporting Agency DCRI, announced this month in one of the talks: “Services are well aware that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, do spy on their allies."
The parents of an innocent boy from Georgia who died in a terrible accident believe that he was murdered
The father of a young boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a imaginative spirit in his middle school, believes that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th in a spirit-like courthouse in the middle school where he went.
The Sheriffs of the Lounds County team concluded that Johnson died of an accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy refuses to do so.
"They are absolutely convinced that their son has been murdered," said Justice Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed that he died like the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that this contradicts logic, physical laws and also sound understanding," said Crop.
They think it's time to get rid of what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, their son was sent to school and he came back to them in search of the dead," he said.
The State representative Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore announced at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow the fact that they're gonna tell me anywhere.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for regular investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original drink meant that Johnson died as a result of "a half-life".
However, the second drink, according to Moore, introduced another cause of death.
"There are several questions here that must be charged or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if Johnson's death reveals sufficient evidence for the order to investigate the criminal act or violation of the civil law, the FBI will request and implement it.
The representative of the Sheriff's Office from the Lownes district was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
The judge from south Georgia ordered the authorities to provide all the videos from the surveillance cameras that the investigators were looking at.
The parents of young people hope that the video notes will contain a step towards revealing how their son died.
The CDC Centre issued a directive on allergies in children
In the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a guide file was issued to assist children in the case of food allergy at school.
It is about the first file of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government because the number of school-age children suffering from food allergy is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergy in children increased between 1997 and 2007 by 18 per cent.
The guidelines include information for schools on how the teaching congregation and staff know about child allergic to food and how to react when it comes to allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have adrenaline – the most commonly used automatic epiPen sign-injector – to be able to react to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The national regulatory authorities have recently updated the rules that allow schools to manage adrenalin more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that appear in conversation with children who have allergic reactions.
A child can say, "It's like someone put me in a language," "I feel like I have a stupid language" or "I know my language."
Parents of intersex children can choose "non-injurious sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize the third sex in children born with an unusual sex machine.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned to either male or female sex.
The new parental law does not require that children have any sex for such children and enable them to have sex on their own lists as “non-unspecific” or “unspecific”.
The purpose of the law is to stop the pressure on parents to make an informed decision in their children for the purpose of sex-setting operations and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
According to BBC, after many years, an intersexual person said: “I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'll stay with a slatan-made doctor, assisted and recovered.
It is estimated that every year 2000 children are born to one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 activities that fall into the diagnosis of sexual disorders, disrupting the term for those who have atypical chromosomas, partial glands (vaginals or varillas) or unusual genetics.
An intersexual could be Wallis Simpson.
Sex screening is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to define sex, it is better to use the best available information and to identify it instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of a child until surgery is carried out, if at all.
New York psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-setting issues, said that the new German law “sees to be a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemmas.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children are not," he said.
The sex screening can be performed without surgery and can then be expected to develop the identity.
The knowledge of how sexual activity develops in a child is not very precise.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a coincidence why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not linked to sex, but to their biological structure, which is neither exclusive nor exclusive to men nor to women, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These roses may occur in secondary sex characteristics, such as verbal size, hairdressing, hairdressing and postures, primary sexual characteristics, such as pluralizing organs and sexual organs, or in the structure of chromosomal and hormones.
This report also provides a review of discrimination involving intersexual and transsexual people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't respond to any sex now have a special team.
Australia and Nepal are already able to mark the official documents of men, women, or "third sex".
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first known "free" person in June when she won a court call so that she could leave the status of an "unzurt" sex at the end of her life.
According to the Ministry, there will be German passports except M (men) and F (women) and the third label, X, which is for intersexual persons.
In neighboring France, according to a report in France, 24 problems remain controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strong Catholic country signed petitions to remove “sex theory” from school.
American Catholic online websites have also argued against the German law and wrote: “With the world being brought to a new state, when it is a question of choice, but sexual activity is not at all, we turn our orders to two other pillars of civilization."
One newborn mother from Maryland also said to baby areas that she would prefer to see a child give birth to sex.
"Family alone is stressful and without any other restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said to the websites concerning parental care.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermafroditis, according to the view of the Greek who had two sexes.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a tablet that could be broken and broken again.
But now, many doubt the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexual liability is complex and doctors can sometimes decide wrong because they do not know how children will feel when they grow up.
"In the half of the 20th century, it was called psychiatric preparedness," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
Continual theory of how to deal with children with uneven sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that sex is subjective.
He created a new concept of "flexibility" and argued that social and environmental causes and impacts – such as parents raised their children – were responsible for children’s genes and hormones and created a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case since 1966, known as "John/John", his theory became controversial.
To the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged by a misbehavior, he recommended that they let their child be completely destroyed, remove his scars and raise him as a girl.
"Media presented this case as a successful case of change, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he allowed himself to get over to the boy and marry his wife.
In 38 years, however, he managed to commit suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are using the "tento model" today.
But in the 1990s, with the coming of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared to be “satisfying with the result”.
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes, but not a single semi-trailer.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a big client, or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man, he could never live “a calm life. ”
And as soon as he was born in 1976, Bruce's surgically removed outside organs and varillas and was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones in 12 years.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
In 18 he was sent to a restless plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was horrible.
I was sterilized after I was born, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a serious gender development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing sufficient amounts of testosterone in order to properly develop its sexual organs.
After learning the truth, he changed to a man, took doses of testosterone and let himself be removed,
The operation caused his inference.
Today it represents others in the organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice with a seat in California, is afraid that the German law "requires for smoking and stimulants".
"Many activists are afraid that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose for the child "unzurt," she said.
We're afraid it's going to be an intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law ends up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australia's law because "it allows adults to choose to be listed in the third section".
"You should be able to make your own decision on the legal basis of your own decision," she said.
The German law wants to be given to her when she was born.
It's a battle that a little child shouldn't commit at this moment.
As they grow, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter who suffers from poor sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “works power” both to parents and to children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called an intolerance syndrome on androgens.
Because her Androgen receptors are leading, they've been in Katie's women's hair.
He's got a vagina, but he's got no part and no vaccines.
She is now 29 years old, Katie is married and works as a student at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although it is unproductive, it is hoped that it will become a parent through adoption or remuneration.
"The law gives parents a certain space so that they do not make their decisions," Baritz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and think about it and give them time before they write “a man ” or“ a woman. ”
In this regard, it's all right – you take care of your child and love her.
You have a wonderful child, and you're happy about it.
You don't have to run with an operation that's irreversible.
"It makes it possible to join the decision and the child and take the difficulties that parents agree on, because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child will decide which sex I'm dealing with more — and that's a great thing.
It gives children the right to make their own decisions.
Opilec burned the whole house of gasoline: He threatened to burn it with his own family!
The tension grew, the fear grew.
The man started to threaten to burn the whole house.
Instead, all available police surveillance in the environment, as well as one of young Boleslav's fans and a group of volunteers.
He also met a police officer who tried to talk to the man about his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to burn the house.
At home, she had to enter the custody unit that her husband had damaged and burned.

In addition to the property, all domestic animals were preserved.
The man didn't go to the police station, the command came after him.
Message: The Obam campaign aimed at transforming Biden for Hillary Clinton
The most recent adviser to President Baracka Both of us, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering the award of a candidate from 2012 by Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton.
This exhibition is the most outstanding sensation of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperina and John Heilemanna "Dubble down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine received copies of the incoming books and announced on Thursday evening that the presidents of the High Commissioner had organized an intensive group meeting and research at the end of 2011 to see if saving would help revive Obama’s desperate hope for recovery.
According to a national-political writer for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martina, the book offers a thorough record of the strengths of leading officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former lead office of Bill Daley's White House, to measure the impact on the election of former Foreign Minister Clinton on Vice-Presidents.
The potential change was closely interconnected by the secretion within the chicage infrastructure of the campaign and within the Oval workers.
Only a few of the most recent advisers, including Daley, former leader of the Obama campaign, Jim Messin, and former chief advisors in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew that this change was taking place.
The book “Dubble Down” says that Daley was a representative of the power to repay Bidena, despite their close personal relationship, and that until the end they decided not to do this when the data showed that Clinton's contribution to the candidate would “obamo's chance have not substantially increased”.
In his conversation with Martin Daley, the administration confirmed that she was really looking at Biden Clinton's revenge.
"I thoroughly examined a number of things and this was one of them," said Daley's letter.
You should not forget that the president had a future look at us at that time, so we said: “Christmas, what are we to do?
While Daley characterised research as "relevant care", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the refurbishment campaign had invested little to find out whether this would be paid in the elections.
"In the campaigns, such money is not available for voluntary and qualitative research if something really does not apply," Martin on AC360 said.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team considered this change.
Martin told CNN that Daley asked if his superior knew about this potential closure of the card.
While Daley said he didn't think that the president's potential change was "knowing", the former lead officer admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book “Dubble down” definitely does not answer the question whether the political probe reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martina if he really thought that Obama didn't know about the research on the appointment of Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
A fantastic smell that shines in the dark?
The British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the darkness – for the use of the media.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a brilliant memory.
He came to the point when he read an expert opinion on magic, and convinced scientists in China to produce a protein that causes light.
This smell reacts with the language of the consumer – it increases the pH in the protein and then causes it to burn.
Chris says that the light is cold when he reacts with the heat of your mouth, and the more you lie, the clearer it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (Olysine me, I taste great), says, "It's a wonderful substance, but if it's about to start, we're going to get 200 GBP for about 2 g of this substance."
The protein we use in the cold reacts with your tongue in neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms, the pH increases and the cold starts to melt.
We've been testing her for the last few months, and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween's celebration, because it makes this amazing side effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the lighting of the media is four times more expensive than gold.
And that's how every cup of coffee stands for me for about 140 GBP.
But it's nice.
Charlie's experimental company with a seat in Bristol is known for its unusual presence of beer, cheese, beef and oil.
His next product should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I would really like to make an invisible smell."
It's basically impossible because of the part of the light caused by ice crystals that makes me cold, but I'm counting on some way we'll find it.
The mold uses fluorescent properties of the media, made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By number
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
We were able to eat sweets with our sister, stay up long, and meet neighbors in the back.
Today, I feel like I'm getting worried.
After two years in my apartment, there was no sugar in my apartment, and this year probably won't be any different.
However, statistics show that I'm, as far as Halloween, black sheep.
According to the National Small Business Federation (NRF) this year, Halloween will celebrate most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and will lose a total of $6.9 billion for sweetness, costumes and hair.
But every time it's about Halloween, there's a trend.
According to NRF, $6.9 billion is expected to go to $1.2 billion on the bones.
This year are the last explosion of the sex mode of non-life objects.
Sex must no longer be just women; sex can also be eaten as pizza, hamburger and butter.
When it comes to men, I expect that through the dead, we will see a lot of zombies, and I will bet that the heavenly men of Daft Punk will add this year to our channels in Instagram.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and monsters.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones in my dream.
In fact, the U.S. NRF spends $330 million this year on pets.
So he'll see a lot of fun dogs.
When it comes to sweetness, we don't waste time.
According to the company Nielsen, US$ 1.9 billion is lost.
It's a 300 million kg Hershey tablet, lisakat, milk duds and Twizzlers, and Clark's dress.
This is a wonderful report for 41 million colleagues who, according to the US Ministry of Commerce, are trying to pass on our fourth.
In fact, during Halloween we buy, and believe you, and consume, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn beans, but according to the National Association of Sugars around Halloween, it sells about 16 thousand tons.
It's about 9 billion individual corn beans.
It's the secret I've never heard of.
Nothing's more typical for Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" and "The house of shock".
In fact, in the United States there are officially dedicated 1200 scary houses that, according to the U.S. insurance company, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes the amazing pictures on which you are experiencing fear and which will give your friend on Facebook, and you can't remove them and the person who likes you will look at the picture and sign a comment as "hexas you're making".
And finally, a little bit about the days.
When we were young, Charlie Brown presented us with a big day (Greet Puppkin) and breaking the windowlight is something like getting a Christmas tree – we're doing it from the small.
Luckily, for us the trend of "children in the day" began with applications Pinterest for the first time, so most of us grew up on the fact that we broke up instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Human Accounting Agency, the United States spends about $106 million on a day.
Dünnj's lamp with myothetic flame on your front porch is probably coming from Illinois, where this year has grown 245 thousand tons a day.
If you gather something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from the town of Napa in California and try to break up their days with almost one tunnel.

We are pleased that this path can be offered to them in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way of living in various competition disciplines in Britain and is now preparing competitions for the strength and reality of the Rally Raid race.
The development of the Defender Challenge vehicle we have really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
Defender Challenge in addition to the offer of school and test day and also the possibility to compete in deserts in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: For two years here we have early elections
President TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election.
A week after the last of the talks for Current.cz said that the other exit is not and every government is excluded from voting last Friday and Saturday is an impossible secret.
"It can't last a long time," said Karel Schwarzenberg with the life span of the beginning of the voluntary period of two years.
With the idea that future voters will choose differently, they do not agree: "I think this will be a little more important decision."
At the same time, the President of TOP 09 will not agree that his party could still lose the vote as a year (in contrast to 2010 a total of 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg suggests that if it was clear in two months that early elections would be made, it would be strengthened by the UN 2011 Andrej Babish.
In the wrong case, according to Schwarzenberg, Babish will lose.
The Turbulent situation in ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after the Polish meeting of the ruling party, announced that he or Michael Hasek, comments Schwarzenberg on:
"The leading democratic parties as little boys go to the head of the state to allow them to turn to the side."
"I thought Mr. Haszek was smarter and smarter."
"Because something so unexpected happened was not seen in my life," added the president of TOP 09.
And to the President of the Earth (who fought in the battle against the Presidential function), he said: "The role of the Head of State is clear: He wants to strengthen this party."
The first law has already been tabled by TOP 09.
What happened to you personally the greatest surprise of your choice?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws, other than the Farsk Register of Treaties, which before the elections were held by the shadow committees, but has fallen under the table with the previous elections.
President TOP 09 in the debate for Current.cz says that such speed is given by "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, the TOP 09 obviously wants to prevent similar attempts from others.
For example, the willing leader of the ANO Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-war because the intention was to register the contract "victory" program of the ANO.
TOP 09 now used a jump - just explained the proposal that had already been dedicated to the second film reading.
The Hasičian units have come to save the lost wall, which was 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous hill in the Kamenolom
Ruby's got to run away after a little car accident.
Three days later, the man who married the dog caught her in a camenolom.
The Hassics went down to the rock wall to save the dogs from certain deaths.
The wall was set free by fire units who came to release it after having in a certain way stuck on a dangerous building 15 meters above the ground.
Ninety-month-old Ruby ran after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days until he was released from the truck.
His owner, Scott Alderson (25) and his friend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flamepit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and thank him for the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After what he ran when he got into a small accident, he ran away furiously after his lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
In the middle of the 14th century, a bistrosic poet named Ruby was watching a 15 - foot [15 m] walk across the country.
Instead, he ran a technical rescue team from Cleckheaton fire station and jumped down to free Ruby, using it to lift up the animal transport bag.
The team leader of the technical rescue team Andy Clayton said: Dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock walls – 15 metres from top and bottom.
When he was saved, he took a bow – he was totally frozen.
But now it's okay.
Then he got a date.
It was a very unusual departure.
The fact that the dog has seen someone is incredible.
Peter Lau, the chief of the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had great happiness during his escape. ”
There was a chance he'd be seriously hurt or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a visit, and in addition to drying and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was afraid of the rescue action."
First of all, I couldn't believe how it got there.
It was wonderful to keep him in the arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and exhausted, he would probably fall.
The hackers took a great job.
What they did was very serious.
We're very grateful to them, everyone was just huge.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We thought he could fall, but he stayed there."
The hazes were great.
We just don't understand how it got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after the 18th year, Katy Perry didn't give up.
During an interview for the Australian polling order this week, this star said that for Jajgerov the song “Old habits die hard” in 2004 was singing convincing vocals.
Perry said when she was 18, she had this year's vet dinner and he followed her.
He added: “It has been a long time, and now it is very dear to me.”
In a statement by the fourth representative of Jagger (70), the representative said that he categorically refused that he would ever make a proposal by Katy Perry.
The representative said, "Maybe you'll have him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest songs (song) that appeared on the Rolling Stones concert hall this year.
Her new "Prism" album was debossed this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe Gives Scots to the Elections · Global Voices
The next day, another terrible story of independence.
This time the warning is issued that the condition for the EU member state of independent Scotland would be his entry into the Schengen area.
This led to stories of passive controls in Berwick and the rest of the streets in the Hadrian Valley.
It is true that Strathclyde's news mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as expected, the news did not escape the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend much of their time adapting their official laws if they do so.
In view of the fact that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the offer of continuing non-conformity for Brussels would be a cheap discount for whatever Scott really wants.
So it's bad enough.
In addition, it's so old that it's been buried, a journalist's case that "independence means passport controls," I heard at least 40 years ago.
Nevertheless, in this website, the speaker is covering one of the interesting ideas.
Why should it really be expected that independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why change the London favor for that Brussels, especially now?
This is a real European story: the great holiday plan to join Europe was finally lost.
The impact of the euro crisis is so called the European Project officially dead.
On the other hand, Europe is affected by committed resistance to the EU or by a reduction in the euro as a common change.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany – based in this year – has come as a retreat, and has already used about five million votes in the so-called federal elections, from Bundestag in the basis of the Free Democrats (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats).
At home, there was always an objection to creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The complexity of Germany and the European Central Bank together with the declaration of the national economy through a joint exchange led many to the view that Europe’s project was going too far.
The euro crisis is only a little compatible with the fact that national governments are dealing with a high budgetary deficit – it was only in the case of Greece.
This is about the euro system, which blocks its members on exchange rates that are useful for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to leave.
Without the possibility of defaving domestic currency, southern Europe is in the area of domestic production to sell German currency.
The only aid is to cut revenue and public expenditure – which Germany spends.
In the context of the current problems with the budget and the currency, there is a deeper reason for European small-scale efficiency.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – a code for support to French and German companies for consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for gasoline as it is in the United States.
This is a paralysing failure in the area of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the freeze of taxes on the world would not restore the collapse of the European petrochemical industry by a left-wing braid from the United States.
As a result, there is an added incentive, especially in France, when the EU is overrun.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that will keep Germany behind and allow Paris to stand in the world at Washington level.
However, as a result of political legitimacy, Paris no longer needs and has abandoned its own economic policy in Europe and the French economy needed to be judged.
As a result: The Royal Navy Le Penove, the National Front of Europe, has just won the main additional elections and has removed the ruling Socialists to the third place.
The Front is now with 24% of the most popular party in France – a temporary warning for British workers that they cannot assume that the violation of rights automatically occurs on the left.
How does Le Penov acquire his new acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections in the coming year would like to use the European Parliament to create an anti-European blockade against joint changes.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely to be, such a block may be dominated first in the history of the European Parliament.
I believe, however, that the growing anti-European feelings and the position against the common measles are linked and the euro is losing.
The EU will not disappear, but the change will be more liberal in the meaning of "European (superior) nations", has already preceded the General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may leave the euro, but France and southern Europe will renew their own changes.
I hope that Great Britain will distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington's increased interest in Tichomore indicates that Britain will be left with the Atlantic cold.
Where's Scotland?
We can choose to be a region (in principle) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – and this includes the possibility of informing Berlin and Brussels when they have to let us be.
I assume that Scotland would lead well to the free movement of Europe, provided that it maintains its own currency.
Cooperation with other thinking countries like this would be easier in non-federal Europe.
In the wrong case, we should take the example of Norway and leave our economic independence.
The Government of the SNP in Scotland is – buying – the most successful political campaign that has won a large majority in Europe in 2011, thanks to the opposition to the plans (and implemented) of the Alistair Darling labor force and the following coalition of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted in favour of independence only in order to take countermeasures adopted by Berlin and Brussels.

A study showed that Africans and Hispanic reach puberty before their white breeds.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
No evidence has been shown that hormones or other chemicals are present.
The panellists claim that one of the guests of earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty isn't so bad for boys.
Former CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children’s health and family problems.
Should a mother be afraid when her daughter begins to grow breast and breast-feeding at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Child Doctors in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I have spent a lot of time telling my parents that it's usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz
The visible signs of development, such as growth of the chest, exercise and in support and physical peace, appear in the girl before.
In the last four years, however, there has been only a small decline in age when it comes to the first menstrual period.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years old and 12.75 years old in 1970.
"When they start developing breast, they will be at least two to three years before they reach the first menstrual period," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty and girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
The most complex test of how to keep on driving is time.
It is discussed what activates the real beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is performed by an adult question 8 years ago, the girl is considered to be “precisely growing”.
In most cases the process is slowed down or stopped – which doctors can closely monitor.
Faster growth may be the reason for endocrinologist to carry out tests to address serious problems such as nausea or cysta.
There are treatment procedures that slow down time periods and prevent other consequences: early bone aging, which may eventually lead to a halt in growth and maturity.
Recommendations regarding medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional growth.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
When it comes to finding medicines, Kaplowitz is careful, but recognizes that "puberting can solve problems with the behavior of a girl and her feelings that she feels better from her peers."
Understandably, there is another big problem: parents simply do not want their young daughters to have menstrual periods.
"They are worried that they can get pregnant, or how they will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to have menstrual periods in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about the ministry together, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came from school scared and angry that she's from her friends first.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is still no relevant evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys – just like girls – get puberty early.
Caplowitz predicts that the most important reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped with the conduct of a study on girls aged 6 to 9, which links the body to puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, Africans and Hispanics have the ability to reach puberty before their white ancestors.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, it appears that the models of timepieces are influenced by all possible economic conditions across the atmosphere and beyond the genes.
Other guess: Although boys are already under the age of toy in their face and on their hands, the trend towards full-fledged puberty is not as noticeable as it is in the girl.
Other doctors participating in the Conference of the American Association of Child Doctors (AAP) have added to this subject further complexity.
Acoustics and exercises are common even in horses and pants.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual incidence of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrineologist from the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be anxious to receive instruction from their child’s doctor about how to talk to their child.
"This may mean the need to talk to a child before you assume," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who develop before need to make sure that even if this happens early, this process is a normal part of life.
Hope Konvalink's role as a host.
Does he have a new job?
Herečka Nadja Konvalink's (62) appeared to be a step in the role of the household and was very much involved.
That maybe a beloved Czech hero would plan to change his profession and become a business in the home?
Hope Konvalink appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and pointed out a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and right away I went.
Even my boss offered me a job and I could live with the beer.
But I refused, rather I'd stay in what I do today," she said with a smile of Convalink, who was a guest at the twentieth anniversary of the operation of the Irish house.
"I like Irish beer and I'm going to give it to Irish whiskey," she made her sweet tea.
And Nadi's long-lasting friend and fellow Paul New.
I'm after death, and in the present new life, I can't hang out.
I've got one beer or one bread a day, and I'm trying to keep it," added here.
Aircraft manufacturers are willing to sit around, there are great restrictions on the ship.
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, the dispute over the width of the seat in the second class in the long distance, which resulted in a high exchange of views on the plane show in Dubai this month.
The subject of the dispute is the widest seats provided in the long years for the economic class – not the one that would normally be preceded by airlines, but its assigned space is the key to effectiveness in the latest flights offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing companies.
Airbus called this week for industrial standards, which would offer at least 46 cm of a wide range of seats in the economic class, but the main American Boeing River says they have to decide on this.
The team was set up at the time the aircraft manufacturer competes in the sale of the largest version of its two-engine long-distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the operation from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the last part of the aircraft is distributed – in particular whether it is 9 or 10 seats – is based on economic efficiency gains on the proposals of the new ‘mini-jumbo’ aircraft.
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" transports 406 people in economic settlements with a width of more than 43 cm scattered by 10 per row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its model A350 transports 350 people in 46 cm of broad economic seats distributed after 9.
Airports often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus is now in front of a flight show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be transferred with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
He recently showed what could be the start of a new advertising war if he showed the financiers a picture depicting three people in the restaurant with the title “Do you like it?”
"Boeing promotes long-term flights in the 7th season than in regional turbulence flights," Airbus leader John Leahy said.
The changes in entertainment skills make people bigger, but the seating in airplanes has not changed radically.
Since the beginning of 70th year, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, the average American population has increased by 10 per cent by 40 to 49 years, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health.
According to American medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century is 100 cm in length.
Airbus claims that his rival is holding the concept of 50th-century seats when the average width of the new baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims that it carried out a research that indicates that the expansion of 2.5 cm improved sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing rejected the size of Airbus companies and said that it was not possible for aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airlines would export charges and equipment.
The company also says that the research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more concerns than on the width of the room.
"It's really about providing air companies with flexibility and enabling them to do things that are convinced they have to do to make them successful," said experts in the cabin room Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what's good for them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For the traveler, there is a major area for the tickets, but for the providers it is a growing problem that can affect the results.
To this end, the competition in the orders of the aircraft with the registered trade in the next decade in value at least $700 billion in catalogue prices is sufficient to remove the barriers to American and European exports.
As stated in the June of the Reuters agency, the distribution of seating is exactly what leads to the battle between the last planes.
Like Airbus, Boeing claims that they achieve 20 per cent better efficiency than the leading market representative in this segment in their last two-engineed flight proposals, model Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
Boing's performance commands depend on the share of the design of the model 777X with 10 seats in rows and 777 with 9 seats in rows.
The profit in unit costs is reduced to 10-year-old concept.
"The reason for Boeing doing this is to increase its seats and make its flights more competitive for our products," said Kevin Keniston, leading to the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins with 10 seats in order for existing models 777 are in line with the fact that many travelers are for the worst distribution that can go hand in hand with lower charges.
"The forty-five centimetre wide seating would be great for the traveler, but the fact is that from the business perspective of Airbus is a proposal motivated by the threat of model 777," said an expert at Mary Kirby's cabin interior, the founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing do not add seats, but they offer the air-conditioned supplier's folder so they can choose.
The sellers of the aircraft even carry a measure of sand to check the competition arrangements.
While agreeing with the agreement, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-cost organisation for low-cost companies and regional passengers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in rows, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
In the meantime, Airbus highlighted the need for more cabin repairs so that he offered some of his planes a wider seat in the streets.
The experts say that without the support of one other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to the new industrial standards remains unexploded, but it can be derived from sales of 777X.
The number of HIV infected has increased in the tens of thousands in Prague.
In the Czech Republic, the number of trained adults is growing every year.
For example, in 2002, the tests confirmed infection in 50 people, 121 years later, and 180 in 2010.
Loni was assigned to 212 and agreed on a record number.
"On the fact that the total number of new diagnosed cases last year exceeds 200, I think there is no mistake," said an expert on the problem of AIDS Miroslav Hlavy, who lived by the Prague House of Light for patients.
According to it, between January and September, 165 HIV patients were born in the country, and 176 were born during the same period.
From the beginning of the monitoring to the end of the year, HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, most of whom were infected in Prague.
Their numbers were 1005.
In the Middle East, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was heard and 156 people from the Juhmorrav region, 130 from the Moravskslezke or 116 from the Ustek.
At least 19 of the students were from the University.
Almost 88 per cent of patients were infected with sex.
Forty people have been raped in the past by blood transfusions.
However, such a case has not been published in the PRC since the beginning of the test, so for more than four centuries.
With the HIV virus, six children were also born, and they were transferred from their mothers.
They don't make sense in the Gravitace film, but it looks beautiful, says experts.
A fantastic film from Gravitice's universe was ever sold in Czech China after the prime minister.
He saw it, according to the Union’s film distributors, some 150 thousand dragons and made over 26 million crowns.
Most of the rating of the image is positive.
Others, however, have certain differences.
Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysics how they liked the film and whether they were aware of some of the misunderstandings that appeared in the film.
Jírí Dušek (Director of the Star and Planetary Brno): I like science-fantastic films that I consider to be modern dreams.
The film Gravitation is not taken, even though it is formed as a "physical real" presentation.
It's not, but it doesn't mean it would be wrong.
I enjoyed it so much.
However, you may need Sandry Bullock hair that is not known to be in a state of trouble.
Hubb's space remote view and the International Space Stations are moving behind a wide range of ordinary tracks, so they can't be seen at one stop.
Some movie fans actually read the negative effect and even the whole conduct of fire in a state of safety.
Skafandry would also not bear such wounds.
Hearts in the Gravitace film are often reached by bicycles with different items and clothes without any more difficulty.
Critics have not been healed, nor has an action plan.
So widespread tragedy on the common road Earth is said to be unrealistic in some of the debate.
It's also interesting why the doctor was sent to the universe to correct the technique.
People on the streets are also concerned about the "unreal" behavior of the moon.
This whole way, like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetary hl. m. Prahy): I've seen him only on a wide scale, but I can only say that I was shocked.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science-fiction.
And in such a case, the author has the right (a measure of duty) to not keep the reality in its entirety.
"More than you mentioned in comparison, I was affected by the three-fold proposed space station with a degrading level technique (China's latest). "
"The Chinese will last until the end of the decade and will probably look better than in the film."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomic Foundation of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computerized scenes, the authors are very successful in their efforts not only to abandon physical laws but also, of course, to a naturally-oriented wild assessment that in various cosmic circles and wars, the moment of hibness is quite right, said by the speaker of physics, and the view on Earth from the universe is very realistic, including the thin spheres of atmosphere and polar spheres that surround the polar areas.
Incompatibility will certainly be found when further examinations are made.
In addition, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of the course of a different spacecraft on a regular drive is rendered in some scenes rather than actually (from the background to the exit).
Jiří Štěpán (Astromitic Institute of Sciences of the Academy of Sciences of the ČR): Some things have been adapted to their needs, but there is no fundamental and no fault in calling a mistake against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared with other films like this is to see that the artists have given their attention to the probability of the events.
From moments that do not make sense, it is for the fact that Hubbl's universe's perspective tends to be different from that of an ISS orbit.
As a result, the different speeds and rescue operations would not actually be able to run as they were shown in the film.
Then, at the time of the division of Kowalski (Cloney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not realize that the whole ISS would rot, so there is no clear reason for the forces that are driving on the Kowalski, which requires both actors to leave at the moment they are no longer on their own.
New vaccine against nicotine may remove the joy from smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can relieve the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of vaccines has been able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction.
Prior to people's trials, there is a need to perform other tests that will take years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We certainly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches can be overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to send genetic information to create anticancer antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then start to create a fluid flow of these antibodies.
The antibodies follow all nicotin molecules in the blood vessels and neutralize them before they get into the brain that prevents the liver from getting nicotinic acids.
In vaccinated mice, which were added to nicotin, they continued in their normal activities.
But the mice who were not vaccinated, "were relieved," said researchers, which means that nicotine reached their brain.
Experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previously on tobacco vaccines, because they contained antibodies.
The injections should be administered as frequently as possible in order to maintain sufficient cold resistance, so they have been shown to be expensive and ineffective.
The costs for the new vaccine should be much lower because they transform liver cells into anti-smokers.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people are completely safe, they could be given to children before they want to try cigarettes, and that would be the case with nicotine.
However, it is much more likely that they would use cookies to stop it.
"They will know that when they start smoking again, they will not have any fun because of nicotine vaccines, and this will help them to escape this crime," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they warn that further research is needed.
Tripodi says it's gonna affect her.
Former Minister of Labour of New South Wales (Australia) will be examined by the State Committee for the Monitoring of Corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi announced that he would change the policy of coastal procurement to the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three estates in the government controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its attention to whether Mr. Obeid was recruiting several state ministers to hire him at Circular Quay, where he owned two restaurants and cafés, refurbished without having to participate in the electoral procedure after his release in August 2005.
The Committee is now examining the claim that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's interests on these properties, based on the evidence submitted on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole.
During the 2005 talks, the government urged us to go to public competition.
The Germans were against it, and they also wanted longer terms of agreement.
In 2009, rents for businesses in Circular Quay, which made the promise $2.5 million a year, have been renewed without the need to participate in public competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of the Interior from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a representative of public competition.
But he said that the changes were made to Mr. Obeid's request, which, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, pointed to a decline in government rent policy.
The list of talks submitted by the ICC showed talks from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodim and Mr. Steve Dunne, who came to the office after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
"Was it the subject of discussions during these telephony talks on the development of commercial procurement policy?" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obed.
Israeli military aircraft were attacked for the purpose of Syria, said the responsible driver
The Israeli military aircraft launched a target on Thursday night at the Syrian port of Lachish, confirming the responsible administrator of Fox News Station.
This responsible person did not specifically say what purpose it was, but said that he was at least one.
The Press Agency Associated Press states that the target was rockets SA-125 Russian products.
At least twice a year ago, Israel carried out an air raid on the supply of rockets in Syria.
A lot of things have gone wrong, and it's different.
Perhaps the rapporteur, Pecinka, spoke in agreement with the fact that the President of the Czech Republic had spoken out against the matter.
Heytman Chovanec was suspicious of me right away when he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
Sobotka's president was always, and it's the symbol of the ČSSD beings.
The rest of the gentlemen were primarily aware of their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is a fundamental and user-friendly, vice-president of Zaorálek has been unable to speak on television as much as possible.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better possibility than that ČSSD proposed to Prime Minister Senat Gajdóšk, the only one would have no initial handy, and I think it would have a standard performance.
That's so good a solution that almost someone in charge supports him.
I'm adding that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and to continue without interrupting the party.
Alena Gajdóškė could without fear establish a minority government with only the blessing of President Babies and without the people, but with the human health minister of Hovorko, who is actually a faithful social democracy.
This minimum government would have great stability because it would have passed a proper referendum law and thus committed to supporting the President of the Okamura Council.
President Babiš would end up dealing with the progress of the tax because he's hot and he's gonna see that he's not going without it.
People wouldn't be causing problems, because Hovorka is the one who wears the best thing they have, and they wouldn't be in the government.
It also pays for the UN, even here a valuable minister would be found, but if they do not want to enter into the risk government, they will also provide support, as well.
Let's get Alan Gajdóšk's truck!
Foreign workers with visa rights may undergo a "rights" test
With the Government's intention to expand police procedures, the "rights" test for foreign workers with visa rights 457 is considered.
The test, if accepted, will be used through the criteria to prevent programme 457 from being used to meet unqualified employment positions or as the last return to move family and friend to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former labist MP Maxine McKev decided a government rhetoric about foreign workers with words that this could affect Australian neighbours.
"The statements of 'citizens at the end of the border' and 'first message for Australia' are very unacceptable since the elections have called for a protected labour market," said the Australian-Indic Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the white labour force should be protected – and I would not be surprised if someone in this region had recorded the announcement of this historic artifact.
The discussion article will discuss 12 measures previously taken by former Deputy Minister Chris Bowen.
Deputy Minister of Tourism Brendan O'Connor, who was at Siri Lance yesterday, where one of the officials was implementing five of the proposed changes and the other remain to be considered.
If the "rights" criterion is adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether "nominee is entitled to the situation where the candidate is in relation to or in a personal relationship with the owner or relevant person of the sponsor undertaking."
In the past experience with companies who intended to sponsor small numbers of workers but then employ hundreds, the number of visa holders may also be required.
Among the 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who was suffering from asthma, he died suspected of infarction this week on the steel ships on the Christmas Island.
A nine - year - old scared son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father died in the middle of his adult brother, who was also on board.
The Australian authorities and the man went to the hospital on Christmas Island where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase begins in 2026.
The Ministry of Transport of Baroness Kramer said that the project "convened the Great Britain together".
Scotland's Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was "suppressed" in cooperation with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of the new high speed train lines between London and West Midlands.
After the phase ends, two leads from Manchester to Leeds.
In June the Government estimated the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from 32.7 billion GBP to 42.6 billion GBP.
The British government, which conducted talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, entrusted HS2 to the company to find further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three and a half hours.
Baronka Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that better offers the Great Britain and its cities."
We gave SH2 green because the enjoyment it brings is huge.
Without that, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also about integration – thanks to the UK, HS2 will be better equipped with 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is for Scotland's good news."
Under Scottish government Keith Brown Mr. Carmichale called for "severally" support for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "A high-speed track has the potential to make Scotland an unmeaning economic advantage, but it also provides the economic burden of Scotland in the overall case of a high-speed railway towards Britain."
We are therefore working with the British government to explore the possibility of entering the high speed railway in Scotland and thus bringing all benefits and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburg line, which the Scottish government plans as well.
I am pleased to review the report on this study with the British ministers during the next year and to discuss further steps in common.
Joint with Bartou closed inspection and analysis of anti-corruption police
Information about the arrest of Vita Barty began to spread on Thursday evening when the server sent the message First version.cz.
MF DNES found that the case took place at the age of the General Security Council (GIBS), its people had to arrest Bart in the centre of Prague.
It was played in front of the Four Seasons hotel.
However, the inspection of cases where the accused police are involved is also relevant to civil persons.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police is a leading analyst and computerist Jan Petržílek.
He's been working for the Security Information Service in the past.
The anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, refused to comment on the fact that the media must refer directly to the GIBS in this regard.
And her speech inspector, Radka Sandor, did not want to say anything about it, he turned to the City State Representative in Prague.
"We will never comment on this question with regard to the protection of the captive facts," said the speech representative of Štépánka Zenklová.
This unspecific reaction may also lead to the fact that the event has taken place, but it is in a way that the speaker is not allowed to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer is Old Chudoba.
The media said that Bart is "and in this thing", but since it's about hidden information, Bart's arrest can't be confirmed or returned.
Some media have previously speculated that Bart's arrest could be linked to some of the police president Petre Lessy.
This was done by Barta, together with former President VV Council John, who was sitting at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The team that was involved in this dispute between the expressive Peter Necess and the VV had even to be resolved by President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship took me.
No one contacted me, I wasn't listening.
"I really don't know anything about it," IDNES.cz Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of police.
He was officially sent by Radek John, the real leader of the party, but he was right at the time.
The Barta now applied for a vote for the Council, the ambassador's order was only silenced - with 175 votes.
The leader of the University of Tomio Okamura declared that he doesn't even know what he's talking about.
"Viet Barta was one of many candidates on our candidate, and as I said again before the elections, he was not even a member of the Society's direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he distanced himself from Barty Okamura, who said before the elections that he gave Bart's room to apply for the Council because he helped him solve the problem of executives.
Vít Bárta appeared in court in 2012 with his former associate with VV Jaroslav Škarko.
The rules on the use of electronic devices at the airport will remain in Australia for a period of time in payment
Traveling Australian airlines will continue to have to delete their tablets and mobile phones during the launch and accession and without prejudice to changes in the United States in order to measure the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has provided an American company with space to change its procedures, so travelers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch video or play games during critical phases of the flight, if the devices remain in the "flight" mode.
Travellers can do this during a considerable part of the year, but many people worry that they can't have access to their electronic books during startup and accession.
The Australian carriers are examining this decision, which calls for a great deal of work by American carriers to meet these requirements, but have indicated that they do not have to change their procedures in the near future.
The Authority for Civil Aviation Safety (CASA) also said that this notification was examined but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in place in Australia.
"CASA has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices at the moment," he said.
This question is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety will be maintained throughout the period and that passengers comply with safety instructions received from crew members.
The company Virginia, which had already talked to CASA about expanding the use of its popular wi-fi entertainment system, was forced to change, but notified that the decision of the regulatory authority was detailed.
"We would be surprised if the CASA's office carried out an analysis of the authorisation to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we're having (free-boiling fun), we're improving customer experience," said the speaker.
The Kantas company announced that it would continue to comply with the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during flight and accession, and we do not intend to change it quickly," he said.
The FAO rules apply to American airlines.
Still, we are interested in the development of a regulatory area that can be useful to our traveler, and we are certainly studying the FAO decisions and the reasons for them.
In the case of air carriers from the United States, the impact of regulations will be reduced by company and will depend on their old airport park.
Transporters will have to state that their aircraft can tolerate radio damages on mobile phones, as well as review tools, school materials, manual equipment programs and travel information.
"As a fly company confirms its fleet tolerances, passengers may be allowed to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readings and smart phones at any sea level," FAO stated.
In exceptional cases, low visibility of the crew shall be ordered by passengers to complete during the installation.
The Group has also recommended that the heavy equipment be safely placed under the seat or in the office area above the head during the flight.
With growing middle classes, stoppers in Singapore live in divorce
In the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops the gold ring, ring and ring so she can pay her daughters school.
"We just bought a house with our husband and I gave all my money," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although each month as an administrator gets $2400 (300 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand for an area in Southeast Asia, where the debt of households is increased, is such that the company of ValueMax, where a woman is performing her transaction, became the third stop in Singapore this week.
The suspension of the mirrors is not only a quick way to pay cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as secure bank loans.
In Singapore, the average annual rate is 17 per cent, more than 15.4 per cent of the rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a seat in the same shopping center.
However, they are benefiting from the fact that they do not require verification of persons (tax history) or evidence of receipts and can provide loans faster than banks.
And as a result, the pressure of families to raise the cost of living and growing household and consumer debt is increasing, millions of people turn to the region for support.
After five years of potential growth from the global financial crisis and from the cheap loans supported by the financial policy released in advanced economies, families with low and medium-income families are turned on the ground to deal with the worsening financial situation.
This week's rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted increasing use of credit in households mainly because of increasing loans as a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have regard to the gross domestic product of the highest household debt in Asia.
Malaysia is on the top of the grid with 80 per cent of GDP, which is an increase of 60 per cent in 2008.
The economists were also afraid of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week only came from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued poor exports and decreased consumer demand.
"It's important that people with rising costs from middle to lower [primary scale] will try to fill their income wherever they can," said Song Sing Wun, an economy in the Malaysian CIMB.
Historical high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to the well - being of people to stop their personal property and take advantage of the opportunity to change for their families.
About 70 percent of the seats stopped in 200 city halls are made of gold.
People say: The gold price looks good, we stop the grandmother's gold necklace and we get it back in the next month.
The largest operator stopped in Thailand, EasyMoney, reported a 20% increase in the number of customers using it in recent months.
The growth in the steel industry is so great that the ValueMax, the operator of the districts in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to the neighboring Malaysia – where there are four areas – but also to Asia, says executive director ValueMax Yeah Lee Chingov.
The company will finance this by using 60 per cent of the 66 million SGDs received this week at the Singapore bridge.
While some discontinuant creditors have been exposed to high rates of criticism, Mrs. Yeah says that the principle offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Clients stop things that are already their own, and the renewal of personal property does not increase the debt of homelessness," he says.
In the company, the principle of ownership is increasingly adopted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Among those who take advantage of obstacles, there are more than people in financial pressure.
The rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax fields when they stop the Golden Fruits or Rolex Clocks, and can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all possible measurements.
"It is the wealth of individuals who need to borrow short-term due to their serious trades or investments or small businesses who need help with solving problems in their financial way," said Mrs. Yeahv.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as they can.
Saved package worth $325 million for Tamman health
The Federal Government insists that a preserved package of $325 million for combating health in Tasmania contains strict conditions to ensure that the government does not support financial resources.
Tanya Plibersek's Federal Ministry of Health announced that the Australian Union is making an "achievable measure" to reverse the crisis caused by the aging population of the island, an increase in the number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Financing for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Danish Ambassador Andrew Wilki.
"The government has come with a necessary rescue package, which, as we believe, will solve specific problems facing the state," Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for the patient's request.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopedic operations and seating operations, will help to remove liability.
Money is also available to hospitals in Hobart and Lanceston, better post-operative care, health care training, mental health services, and the provision of personal electronic health records in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the opinions that my previous clinical doctors have told me that the best way to help the Tamaman health system," said Mrs. Plibersek.
The Ministry stressed that the German Government must require a precise regime of evidence and evidence.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the Australian currency and to inform monthly about where additional funding has been provided.
A three-thirds committee will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be useless, “until there is a genuine reform to establish a more sustainable basis for the Tamman public health system”.
Still, he thanked the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first called on when he met with the president of the government at the beginning of the summer.
"I believe that a federal aid package can relieve public health from the critical state," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government, these additional chosen procedures will clearly revert to a recent scourge.
Speaking of the federal opposition in the area of health, Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is only a "deployment".
"That's why I'm here, it's that the lab government stole $430 million from our health system," he said for ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes about half a billion dollars, and the Australian alliance that owes $300 million, and pretends it's a good news.
Mr. Dutton called Mrs. Plibersek to assure her that no dollar from the saved package will be spent on higher bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition, said in the fourth Committee on the Global Monitoring of Chemical Weapons, while exploding the eastern conflicts in the north of the country, and this was not far from one of the places where the substances were placed under suspicion.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also reported that more than 120 000 citizens had been killed since the beginning of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The notification of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came before 1 November,
the period during which this organisation established, by its seat in Haagu, Damascus, for the destruction or failure of all chemical weapons and machine equipment for mixing chemicals for the purpose of the manufacture of a liquid gas and the filling of the ammunition.
The completion of this in principle of the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which is planned to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stocks.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemical substances and weapons, including hypertensive and nervous fluids.
The announcement came on Thursday when the war in Safira, where the expert talks about the establishment of a factory for the production of chemical weapons and supplies, introduced the Syrian human rights monitor to the British seat.
A group of activists who were monitoring the total number of victims in Syria through the network of activists announced on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
There must be 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar Asada, 18,678 government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hizballah soldiers.
Among the killers, there are also 2,202 government passengers and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN organization claimed that 100,000 people died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict has brought about 2 million citizens to leave the country.
Asid's units have been fighting in Safire against rebels, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaida for weeks.
The notice on Thursday indicated that the losses were on both sides, but she had no specific figures.
The wars were undermining the danger, the men facing inspectors for chemical weapons, who, during their mission, are in the midst of continuing civil war in Syria to rescue the chemical arsenal, must deal with the harsh terms.
In a statement by the OPCW Office, which is closely working with the UN, it was said that its team is now “responsible to verify – and to monitor the destruction – of the Syrian declared basic equipment for production and packaging/filling”.
He added that “no further control activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of auditing work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said that because of my security concerns, they were not able to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that the two sites were "refused and ... the positions of the chemical weapons programme, which contained, were transferred to two other declared sites, which were controlled".
It was not immediately clear whether the device in Safire was one of the places that inspectors OPCW could not visit.
Syria has agreed to the full destruction plan of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Board next month.
"I complain of the courage and stability that you have shown in fulfilling this most important mission as this organisation had when it had," said observer director Ahmet Uzumcu in his comment by OPCW.
Now, in its third year, they stand against themselves in the civil war, especially the sunnitic Muslim rebels and Asad's government, with its security forces, which are full members of the Alawits section, which are related to the Chilean Islam.
As for further development, the Chief of Observer Ramí Abdul Rahmán said that in the middle there was a strong explosion within the anti-air defence plant in the Syrian coastal province of Lakisia.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Fire over the judgment brought against the founder of the bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and neighbors of 202 people killed in a bomb attack at Bali in 2002 reacted in a clear manner to the judgment brought against the last of the founders who were set before justice and said that the death of Patek should be corrected.
A train that spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most visible persons in Southeast Asia was sentenced to 20 years in prison for forming an explosive device used in a bomb attack.
In 15 years, he could be temporarily released.
This 45-year-old man was chased by a gang murder victim at a two-night club in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people were left dead, including 88 Australians, and many wounded.
He was also pursued by a criminal in several other points of complaint relating to terrorism, including a series of bombing attacks at the Indonesian churches on the night of 2000.
The complaint asked for life, although she could insist that a man with the look of "Demolation man" (bourač) receive the death penalty by his story of the expert on the production of explosives.
This decision relived the painful memories of June Corteen's mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-olds, Jane and Jenny during the Nazi attack by the Paek and the rest of the founders about ten years ago.
In tears, she said that Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
Ms. Corteen said to the AAP agent: "It should be established before the reading is fixed."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when a strong charge was issued on 12 October 2002 shortly after 23 hours outside the parking lot.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber fired bombs filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into coma for a month, and while he was kept alive three times for doctors, he died.
Mr. Hughes said that Pataka would have to face the same trial as three other members of the terrorist rebellion Jama Islami responsible for massacres – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imama Samudru – who had been repaired four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty as no one else.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
It's been 20 years since 202 people were killed and hundreds of others were injured, and it's not that much.
The Patek was standing before the court as the last of the agents on Bali.
The arrest took place about ten years ago, but finally in January 2011, it was found in the Pakistani city of Abbottábad, where the former leader Al-Káidy killed Usama bin Ládina four months later.
During the trial, a FBI agent announced in his testimony that the reports of the media revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-connect the terrorist groups from Southeast Asia to Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up on himself," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt sorry for how much he had done to someone else.
The value comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack which will be later this year and which will be attended by the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of shame," said Mrs. Corteen.
The package can still be called against judgment.
FAA: Travellers in the airport can now use technology transfers (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Travellers of airlines will be able to use their electronic equipment "from defense to defense" – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to reading, playing her, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of unexpected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Travelers, however, should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as the change will take place, according to individual airlines, the FAA manager Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to set up FAO management, as long as their flights comply with the new rules and have updated the school manuals for the floating crew and the device management guidelines in order to comply with the new rules.
FAO indicated that it had already obtained plans from some airlines to expand the use of mobile electronic devices in airports.
Among the companies that already planned are Delta and JetBlue.
"On the basis of the status of such a plan, we can improve the increased use of electronic devices very quickly," FAO stated in its statement.
At the same time, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the airport door closes.
They cannot be stopped until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 kilometres and the captain is not allowed.
From passengers it is expected that their devices will start again when the plane closes to stop, and will not stop until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic pollution may allow their passengers to use their equipment during the flight, landing and riding.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft that were designed to enable passengers to use Wifi at higher sea level are expected to meet this criterion.
Laura Gladings, president of the Association of Professional Affairs, welcomed the change.
"As soon as new rules are implemented safely – and we will be able to cooperate with transport companies – it will be a success," said Glading’s statement.
In fact, it urges us to look “intently ” at ourselves.
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and e-mails or storing data will continue under 3 km above sea level, the agency said.
Travellers will be notified to switch their smart phones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, online game of the type of scrabble that he played herec Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well as we know, taken out of the American Airlines company's plane because he refused to launch his device when the plane was parked in the yard.
And more difficult devices like notebooks will have to be kept in place because I'm afraid they might hurt someone if they fly through the cabin.
The phone calls will continue to be banned.
The rules for the use of mobile phones do not violate the FAO, but the American Federal Telecoms Committee.
The FAA may cancel a ban on certain electronic devices during flight and accession.
Last month Mark Rosenker of the State Security Committee, a national security expert at CBS News, said mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create pollution with navigational devices, but also from FCC data, we know that they can cause the destruction of the transmitters in the air," said Rosenker.
The Advisory Committee established by FAO to examine this problem, proposed last month to allow the government to make greater use of electronic devices.
In recent years, the FAO has developed a pressure to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a democratic from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate reason for this order.
Limitations are also becoming increasingly difficult because the use of such devices is widespread.
Some studies indicate that by the time a third of the passengers forgets or ignores their equipment.
FAO began to limit the use of electronic devices travelling in 1966 in response to the destruction of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio, the technical costs of the earlier period.
New airlines are much more exposed to electrical systems than those of previous generations, but they are also built and approved by the FAO administration to be free from electronic pollution.
A few years ago, airlines have offered travel use of Wi-Fi in the coastal waters of the sea.
Plans for Wi-Fi systems are also easier to deal with pollution.
A large majority of airlines should be able to make more use of electronic devices within the framework of the new rules, said Huertva.
Modern electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio broadcasts than they did in previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue a minimal transmission when translating the page.
But the transmission is stronger when devices arrive or send data.
Among those who insist on releasing restrictions on the use of these travel devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the representatives of this company filed a transport aircraft with their electronic readers Kindle and carried out an experimental year, but no problem arose.
The members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices represent any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airpassers said that it is convinced that the destruction of these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee reported that there are only external reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause the destruction of aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA pilots be allowed to order passengers to launch the device during flight according to low visibility devices.
The group of road industry welcomed these changes and it agreed on a reasonable procedure for the travel public, which technology uses in a fair way.
"We are pleased that FAO has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported from the garden in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after which it was found on a rough surface in the Black Sea and released back into the wild.
One Christmas was transferred to Aberdeen a month after she had previously healed a Scottish SPCA in a saved medium until she was cured.
The traffic center Colin Seddon said: “This Christian must have migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind came over her North Sea."
According to all of this, his strength came and he found himself on a rough surface.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was unable to recover, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When he was released, he was in good condition and health.
Is the European elite ready for trade with Britain?
The Brittany Business campaign was launched in depth with a view to connecting businesses and defining what changes in the EU's relationship are to see British entrepreneurs and companies creating jobs.
To this end, we have made the biggest and most complex research that we have asked the former British entrepreneurs for their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov asked 1,000 leading British companies representing the largest sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results will be a lot of surprises.
We have found that the majority of businesses are now trying to move out of Europe and focus on the countries that are modernising and growing, while the EU's states are advancing.
They want to see how the government introduces new trade relations with countries, such as China, India and Brazil, rather than hindering the long-term and innovative process of reforming the secret European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas, from monopolical regulations under the product law, most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
Panovala’s general discontent with the single market and the entrepreneurs said that the costs of the Brussels regulation now outweigh the benefits of being a part of the European trading area – the agreement has reached up to 40 per cent of large businesses, thus traditionally the largest European companies.
And finally, our research of leading businesses has left the most important knowledge, and most of them want Britain to change the Treaty and its relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
From the finding that companies of different sizes and the main business group have been challenged, it appears that the business sector is pressing for a "soundful change", which affects the effects of the return to Britain.
In fact, there is much – the achievement of changes to the Treaty and better agreements for Britain can mean a profit up to 16% when voting in the EU's asylum referendum.
The President of the Government should not be concerned: this study shows that the British trade supports its plan to modernise the conditions of the British Member State in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to mean a significant slowdown from the current export of force back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and given how the euro area is going on the road for a more economic and fiscal union, and it is still more necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our study show, this means refocusing on trade and fundamental change in Brussels’s regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted, the spying went too far!
The United States has often "far away", according to AFP Chief of American diplomat John Kerry at a video conference between Washington and London.
Information collection, but according to the Minister, has served to eliminate terrorist attacks.
"First recognition from Washington" according to the AFP has been established in the middle of a preliminary policy on both coastal Atlantic due to the scandalous data monitoring of the United States National Security Agency (NSA), which has also become an American association.
"In some cases, I agree, just as President Barack Obama has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
However, in the discussion, he was primarily exaggerating the practice.
The collection of information is necessary in order to combat terrorism and to prevent attacks, such as attacks on 11 September 2001, attacks in the United States, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or London in June 2005.
"We have been prevented from flying, the buildings have been bombed and people have been killed because we were able to be informed about the records at the time," Kerry emphasized.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases, it has gone far too far".
Aféra, along with the American inventions that had been closely monitored by cell phones, took place this month in Europe.
The other showed that the Americans were watching the cell phone from the German Chancellor Angely Merkel.
European leaders did not hide complaints and some called on the European Union to try to reach agreements that would require or significantly limit monitoring.
Alexei Miller from the Gazprom company says that his attempt in Bulgaria is in pursuit of a new oil generation
The launch of the South Stream airport building in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said Director Gazprom.
"Today we are witnesses of the border: the construction on the Bulgarian part of the Southern Stream, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is the key source of energy security throughout the European continent.
The demand for South Stream should add diversity to the Russian export routes across Europe.
The agreement between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian oil to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, says the officials.
Miller says that direct contact with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been removed.
As the entire project starts its operation in 2015, the Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream airport at low prices.
The Gazprom company says that the building in other countries has to start at the end of this year.
The annual capacity of 2.2 billion circulators of the earth’s surface is proposed.
Hizballah sent thousands of soldiers to Syria.
He's waiting for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese army of Hizballah released 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle in the province of Kalamón.
According to the disturbing reports of Israel in the mid - 20th century, in two places in western Syria, the rockets were destroyed right at Hizballah.
This Lebanese Chilean organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the dark army.
His programme is also a fight against Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but clearly stated that the ban on the transfer of weapons to the hands of Hizballah to Lebanon.
The reports on the average Israeli fleets on the stock of weapons in western Syria are first clarified.
Israel’s attack did not comment, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean Sea by the Syrian rocket base Sübar Jjabla south of Latvia.
The al-Arabi news station claims that there were two stocks in which rockets were prepared for transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was about the rockets of the Russian product SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Jishaj said Syria is constantly trying to save Hizballah rockets and the Syrian plane teaches members of the Hizballah Armed Section to live with rockets.
SA-8 are old rockets that have been armed by the Syrian army since the 1980s.
They're placed on a moving truck.
Although they are relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small sizes it is easy to hide them.
They're equipped with a radar that will go off after the fire, so it's hard to target them.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in the area inhabited by ruling alavites.
It's about a well-equipped area, and Hizballah has just participated in the wars in western Syria in the past.
He claims that it helps to protect the Syrian Chilean community, which belongs to the Aleutian community.
Now there are some 15,000 of his warriors ready to help get the army back to Kalamón.
With Hizballah there, his units also support the Syrian army.
Kalamón lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country of Homs.
The battle should be directed by the source of al-Arabi to the recent attack of opposition to the leadership of the Syrian Chilean Brigade of Fadla Abbáse in the Czech part of Damascus.
Hizballah helped the Syrian army this year to fight back to Kussir in the Lebanese border.
Many rebels from Kussayra went straight to Kalamunu.
Recently, it seemed that most of the citizens in the Czech Republic had sought early elections.
For the reasons given, corruption, money laundering for oversaled purchases and state bans, tax increases, and in the latest series of government scandals were introduced.
According to the results of the poll, most citizens have expressed the view.
That this was not really happening to them, and the attitude that he had here (the stealing and lending of this state) was really calm.
Otherwise, I can't explain that 3,413,497 volts were not delivered to volbs, 596,357 volts were voted TOP 09 384 174 volts were voted by ODS, whereas 4,394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52,16% of all eligible voters.
Which is the majority of them.
When the above-mentioned party referred to in Article 1 016 829 of the ČSSD, then the old order (because all the parties concerned were involved in the "sale" and accrual of that State), then 64.23% of the eligible voters actually agreed with this position.
In fact, the majority of voters pointed out that they are not responsible for the abuse of the wines of theft and the submission of this State.
Or do you think the members of the ČSSD who share the principle of equal law?
Is there any help at all?

The Royal Commission found that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) were accused before complaints against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Committee on Sexual Abuse of Children found that before a complaint against child abuse was filed against Jonathan Lord of the city of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were guilty of sexual abuse of children.
However, the Commission stated in its initial statement to the Commission that this association had never solved the case of sexual abuse of the child in its organisation.
The executive director Phillip Hare was questioned when one of the employees of YMCA was accused of child pornography violations and the other when a physical therapist in Caringbah from YMCA was sentenced in 1991 to sexual harassment of children who were in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the Commissioner, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second one.
He agreed that the initial statement of the YMCA association was also unclear when it noted that external audits were carried out in the YMCA organisation, which assessed the organisation as a pre-retirement of the rights of the children.
The evidence submitted by the Commission is that the YMCA organisation was warned that the Ministry of Education and Society audited the second of the four possible evaluations this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with YMCA when he was 21, admitted that his own direction had failed when Mr. Lordd agreed, without making sure that his staff knew the obligation to report a breach of the rules on children's safety.
Earlier this year, Lord was sentenced to sexual harassment of 12 boys who were allowed to work in YMCA for two years.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting to Mr. Lordem's children's safety.
The members of the staff gave evidence that they were witnesses to such abuses, including that Lord was with the children on his own, that he was watching them, that he would let them sit on his lap, that he liked them, and that he would let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was lorded and asked for the training of children's safety because he had done his best, testified that Jacqui Barnat, leading children's services at YMCA in the city of Caringbah, who was lord over it, was “very scary and often difficult to talk to him about something.”
The Director-General said he did not accept evidence from the staff that they felt guilty if they had to contact their superiors and report their effects.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had delayed their judgment, and that is why they had no problem.
Mr. Hare said that the board of YMCA in New South Wales shared his opinion that the teaching of Jonathan Lord's case for the organization was "no message" and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign the agreement on the maintenance of mildness shortly after the accusation was made by the General Manager for Child Services in YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said that the objective was to avoid breach of the evidence, but was "slowly hot" and was misappropriate.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University of Griffithy told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organisation in 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in the collection, verification, employment, training and staff management.
The hearing was dismissed on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of the Prime Minister, but he admitted that it was unlikely that he would return.
During the night conversation on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation from the 59-year-old policy office, he expressed his views on the different areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, after ten years in the lead position, Mr. Blair has been most reluctant to discuss British politics, and his comments have limited his foreign affairs and his role in sending the Bizkojjöldskölds's peace quarter.
When asked whether he would return to the post of the Ministerial President, his answer to the London newspaper Evening Standard read: “Yes, of course, but it will probably be difficult to do so, so...”
While in Cardiff, the representatives of experts gathered on horse performance to fight the price of the Year, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for Fenton Kirkland's three-year-old.
Although he was not yet going to school and just a few months ago, he made the first steps, this guy and his animal pet, the Shetland Pony Toffe, hungryly pushed three cars to finally get the main price and left 30 trailers behind.
These indiscriminate two – with the same height – were conducted at each year’s competition at the Sunnybank railway station in Rudry’s village near Cardiff, praised for its appearance, behavior and style.
He set himself against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant boots, pushed his boat into a happy field and let his two-year-old Toffe go through the circle.
Fenton was commended for his natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for the look and personality.
Fenton Toffee was born in the spring of his third birthday, and since then he's been playing with this Shetland poem every day.
His mother, Donna (30), said: “Fenton and Toffee are very cooperative."
They didn't have a lot of hope, but eventually they went out with a gold ring and a chain.
It was just the area he was fighting with Toffe, and when he won, we were overcrowded.
Everyone thought of him as a phenomenal and all other people wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales goes to his aunt Sharon Howells, who holds horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howell says: "There was a rising atmosphere, and everyone was excited and excited."
He ran after the sand all along the range of the arena, and though he did so little, he did a great job.
Fenton is owned by animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm and has reached the age of two cooks.
In view of how he started, it will be soon to compete with the King for a year, and I'm sure he'll do well.
“ Fentons are only three, but he already knows how to control the ponies every year, ” said the speaker.
He's making a great team together.
The natives brought out Fenton and Toffee for their outstanding performances and the way they were presented in the competitive environment.
They always watch how well the team's work is between the ponies and those who lead it - and Fenton and Toffe were on the best side.
I'm sure Fenton helped out with the nice clothes, he really fell in there with him.
You've got some weird news to be searched.
China's newspapers, which on the title page requested the release of a reporter charged with the contract, will be thoroughly investigated, said the printing manager.
Newspaper New Express, sitting in Guangzhou, made a very public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took payments to think of company stories in part by his own state.
The manager said that the New Express news will now be carried out "full order".
The regulation to "justice" came from the State Department for printing and publishing, advertising, film and television in the province of Kuang-tung.
The preliminary investigation showed that during the period from September 2012 to August 2013, New Express from the kanchengsk group Evening News issued several false reports about the company Zoomlion.
"The editorship of the New Express news was not organized," he said in his statement to the manager.
He said he had to decide "to impose the administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a violation of the press licence".
He also “ordered the kancheng group Evening News to complete the New Express mailing list, and recommended that the responsible persons in New Express examine it and immediately modify the New Express guide”.
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles dealing with financial imbalances in the company with building equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his papers published two applications for his release on the title page and claimed that they were for his press work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on the state television and admitted that he was paying for false news.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and to the entire media sector and its ability to build public confidence," said the CCTV State Reporting Station.
I did it mainly because I was buying money and fame.
I realize I was wrong.
After Mr. Chena's apology, he issued a letter New Express on the title page stating that she had sent without sufficient control of his message.
In recent times, a number of serious suspects have been exposed on television.
The Committees say that the recognition is still regularly issued, without prejudice to the change of the annual law, which prohibits the authorities from using anyone to accuse themselves.
There was a tunnel for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico with its own railways
One of the most exciting tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, filled with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railways, was revealed.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of the size of the hole once a meter as one of the most mysterious secrets they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which is called the length of about six football clubs, connects the warehouse near Tijuan in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of unencumbered warehouses, where it can easily hide the cost vehicle before placing drugs.
The authorities indicated that the tunnel had been closed before it could have been transported unattended.
In conjunction with the discovery of the customs tunnel, the authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to the Court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as directors were charged with holding marijuana and cocaine with the purpose of distributing it.
In the event of a suspension, penalties shall be imposed for the removal of the liberty from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, the passengers are headed for large waterways.
The tunnel is the eighth largest tunnel in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered in October after the earthquake in central Mexico, which poses a problem before drug cartels, as the fastest way to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a walk in the length of approximately 650 metres, which led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The economy and the Centre offer management.
Offering, for example, a joint injection
New integrated news of the economy in the Far East Carlin.
The economy has taken another step towards transforming the Centre into its media home.
From the package, the Economics and the Centre has a common top management.
"The integration of the organisational structure and the staff of the Union are essential for the integration of the two issuers into the common media home," comments made by the vice-president of the Economic and Social Council and the trusted Director-General Kamil Čärmák.
The German who will be in charge of a single management is the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demoth.
The new business manager was Paul Voparíl, who was appointed by the director of the two company Zuzana Tilcher.
The new head of information technology became Stépán Burd.
Vladimír Piskáček is a joint editor, whose team is also the editor of the Jakub Unger transformation.
The newly established function of the marketing manager was entrusted to Adela Pitts.
A self-defense of corporate communication is a new leader of the Lhotska Faith.
The joint financial manager is Karel Jalud, the management of human resources for both of these companies is leading Petra Slaba.
"The new organisational structure, apart from others, allows us to access the market with a joint supply of inert products, to improve the design of the content of all the titles issued and, in the latter, to further significantly enhance the business management of the company," he added.
The Economics company, which owns Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract on the purchase of the company Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of the year.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings creates servers Currently.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, expanded e-mail base under the brands of Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency.
The company is the publisher of economic news, the IHNED.cz reporting server, the Weeks of Respect and Econom and the number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, the most long-term success in selling digital versions of their main titles is a long-term failure.
This year, in June, the publishing industry moved to the newly built modern spaces in the Persian Karlin.
CME's on the TV bus.
He'll lose almost a quarter of people.
The CME's media team will drop.
By the end of the year, he's trying to get rid of thousands of people.
I'd like to get all the extra work done and just want to focus on his main business, television.
The group, which owns Nova TV in Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of 4,500 people.
It's almost a quarter of people going to work.
The media team operates television in ČR, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is a company CET 21, which holds license to send television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech versions of the MTV.
How much satisfaction comes to Česka, where the group employs a total of 650 people, and what this will mean for the German TV TV unit Nova, it is still not clear.
"It's early and we can't really comment on it," said communications director Novy Josef Koukołíček.
According to the MF DNES information, the excellent release of Czechs will certainly not be exempt, but far from the greatest impact this should have on the staffing position of the CME in Romania and other countries.
Both New Chiefs of News Christoph Mainush and Michael Del Nin, who were behind the long-term director of Adrian Sarbu's, spoke in the middle of a conference interview with analysts about their intention to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television industry.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly limit the costs of production of its own order, film and production activities.
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague on the night of cold spring
In the industrial area of the ČKD in Prague, a large-capable container was burned, according to the founders, apparently a cold glass.
"The fire was already burning in the fire on the fourth day before a eleven-hour evening, the fire was still burning this morning," said Paul Adam's Polish enthusiasts.
The amount of damage in the air in the environment shall not exceed the allowed limit according to the measurement.
More damage and fire causes are still unknown.
The area in the Colbeno street gradually reached a peak of five tenths of the passengers.
"It's about the fire of a large-capable cook, probably a cold glass," Adam said.
"In the area, there is no functional hydraulic network, so we're going to have the help of driving from the tank," she added.
According to the Tn.cz server, it was complicated to have a badly functioning hydrant network shut down, so the builders had to get the water back off.
The Chief of Staff has declared the second stage of the firefighting.
They're a total of four, and in the most important cases, they're a fourth.
In place, chemicals were also released to verify the peace of dangerous substances that could get into the air by fire.
"But they didn't mean in the air the amount of damage that would violate hygiene standards," said the speakers.
British police delivered Assange's release notice
The British police have today issued a notice of the release of the Founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found a shelter on an Ecuadorian island in London, where he requested asylum.
Scotland Yard reported that Australia's 40-year-old "admission notice" had given him the request to get to the police station and that if he didn't, he could be threatened by arrest.
Assange, under British law, seized his opportunity when the Supreme Court canceled his appeal against the issue this month, and he was about to go to Sweden because of the charges of sexual crimes.
Because he was afraid that Stockholm would go to the United States, he was looking for a 19th June attack on an Ecuadorian settlement in London, where this South American country asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard “has received notice of a 40-year-old man asking to be sent to the police station on the day and hour that he was assigned to,” said the speaker.
Assange continues to violate the conditions of imprisonment.
The majority refused to provide a comment on the issue.
Assange is afraid to be released from Sweden to the United States, where he may be accused of spying because WikiLeaks published 250 000 American diplomatic documents on the website.
The driver got a check 1,000 pounds because he went over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The motorist was caught 1,000 pounds because he went up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from the town of Tiptree in Essexu was a 27-mile walk in his Mercedes Benz on A120 train in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had the same knife.
In Colchester Howie's police court, he admitted to the charge that he was being conducted in a fair and impartial manner.
There were seven points on his account, resulting in six months' order.
Hoviem was also ordered to pay the costs of 90 pounds and a fine for the 100 pounds charged.
As a result of tax on foreign property owners of the Dutch London bubble
The Ministry of Finance initially calculated the tax on the contribution of the financial property, but is waiting for the final decision of Mr Osborn, which, in the 2012 budget, represented 7 % of the rent for buildings at the price of more than 2 million pounds and annual payments for buyers who own their properties in company, never as individuals.
The result of the transfer of property in the housing fund in the period Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached 708 million pounds in 2012/13, has already exceeded the total accounts for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North East and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: "In view of the growth in the transfer of property to high-value houses and the representation of legislation that should prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that the property of high-value is small regardless of the effect of the old tax system on the head."
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to be interested in buying property in London, if any, that the owners of existing property are interested in selling.”
Previous properties – 5 % to 10 % of the price-by-value housing market – in the rich sand that falls from Fulham after Wimbledon, reported an increase of 11.8 % over the last year.
The average prices in London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6 % since the year, but were replaced by a growing "home market", which, according to the study of the Real Office of Savills, increased south, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%).
Scientists have shed more light on how the motions of the ocean are related to the load of dogs.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs return more transport (from dog to dog), while nerve dogs have too much left.
Now, however, scientists say that the other dogs can record and react to these mild differences in the movement of the ovaries.
Professor Georgio Valortigara, neurobiologist at Trent University, said: “People are well aware that both the left and the right side of the brain have a different focus on businesses that generate positive or negative emotions."
That's what we've been trying to warn other people.
He added that just as it is in humans, and in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left movement and on the contrary, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to obtain further information on how dogs react to the inequitable return of other dogs, researchers have monitored animals that were watching movies on other dogs.
They measured the temperature frequency of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Obviously, it won't last long before we figure out why their eyes sometimes go on one side and the other on the other.
Professor Valortigara said: “We have promised dogs about dogs – whether in a natural version or in a kind of silhouette – that we may escape any traffic, and we have also managed to correct the movement of the eye and highlight it more directly or to the left."
When the animals saw another inexhaustible dog riding on the carriage boat (from the sight of the dog returning the boat), she remained calm.
However, when it noted that the ovaries were too slightly left (again from the view of the ovary ovaries), their fat frequency increased and the animals were not sure.
Professor Valortigara said he didn't think dogs would communicate with each other through these movements.
It seems that dogs have learned from experience what moves they have to move and what they don't have to pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and move their tails in a single direction, it is relinked to friendly behavior, and transport movements produce less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience. ”
Researchers say that finding out can help dogs, veterinarians and flowers better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, professor of dog behavior at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study that tested whether the left and right side of the dog was important.
Last year a team from Lincoln University found that dogs take their head off the left by watching the aggressive dog, and the device by looking at the happy dog.
And in another professional meeting from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “As a dog, dogs were listed with greater probability when he returned to his father than when he had become more insecure – exactly to abandon the Italian study. ”
The difference may be that dogs in these different animal studies in movies or animals have not appeared entirely like dogs.
He explained that she could help study on how dogs react to real dogs.
"Although there are clear evidence that both brains are used for various purposes, many details still need to be explained – and dogs are not the exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it will not be long before we understand why their eyes sometimes go on one side and the other on the other.
Arctic Monkeys because of Alexe Turner's failures moved a concert in Glasgow
The Arctic Monkeys rock band held a concert in Glasgow after which the main singer was diagnosed to attack the garden.
The Sheffield Group was to be released on Friday in the City Hydro complex.
The weakness of the main singer Alexa Turner, however, led her to move.
The notification of the group was followed by a similar invitation to postpone the fourth edition of the LG aerona in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official websites, the Arctic Monkeys Group states: “After the decision to postpone today's LG exposure in the arena in Birmingham and on the basis of a medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys must also be released in the Hydro complex in Glasgov planned on Friday, 1 November.”
"Alexi Turner was diagnosed with cancer and, unfortunately, he will not be able to recover."
The exhibition in the LG arena in Birmingham on November 20th and the exhibition in the Hydro complex on Glasgov on November 21.
All the lists on this issue remain valid.
We would like to apologize to everyone who bought the tickets, for the inconveniences that made them do so.

Pope Frantiszek named after the first cardinal
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Frantiszek was the first to name the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
Cardinals have the highest position in the Catholic Church right after the pope and are those who love the pope, so Frantisek will establish his first group of men who will finally help choose his position.
Now there's 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches 80 years of age, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group thus reduces to 120 cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the celebration of the new cardinals, the gathering of the present cardinals will be known as a consistory.
"Papež František decided to give his decision to allow the U.S. Consistency to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from various parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the list of Catholic Voices said that the number of volleyball cardinals in the U.S. is probably pretty tight.
He said that the pope usually names as many cardinals as it is necessary to increase the number of voters to 120, and as many cardinals as 80 years old, as much as he wants.
The Consistor of the next year will be significant because it will be the first post chosen by František in the spring of this year, Valero said.
At this time certain guidelines are being made for Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have an odd number of cardinals.
It will also discuss the first election of cardinals since the establishment of the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who have been tasked to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope has explained everything to himself.
"Ninny Frantisek chose these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said it's "as far as possible" that these cardinals ask for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before, it's a simple news story.
Valero said that the popes traditionally raised the position of cardinals of bishops from large places, but Franticek is “full surprise – so we don’t know who he is. ”
The GM company is forming some new low cost cars in the United States due to the correct handling of seating equipment
According to the United States Car Safety Authority General Motors, almost 19,000 of its new (2014) low cost vehicles Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra are available to carry out an undertaking with manual refurbishing.
Some of these vehicles may have a mechanism of fittings of the front seats.
As a result, seat belts are not in accordance with the federal rules of car safety for head belts.
A notice posted on the websites of the National Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if the rear road is hit, the headrest must not be properly protected, which increases the risk of a charge”.
The weighted models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM introduced a supply to the market in June and for this previous American car, it is the most important introduction of vehicles to the market since the restructuring of the Bank in 2009.
The GM company informed the owners of the start-up supplies in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notification to the owners of the 16-day disability of the government, which in October weakened the growth of car sales.
The sales of the supply of Silverado and Sierra, which were processed for the 2014 models, amounted to about 20 per cent for the first 10 months of this year, announced on Friday of the GM company.
In October the GM sold 42 660 models of Silverado and 16 503 models of Sierra.
New York bridge shares grew by 1.4 per cent on Friday at 37.47 USD.
A reliable cry of Obama's volleyball
I loved both of them twice — I shared my hope of a possible change
It says that the Ombudsman's sincere efforts have led to the obstacles of the Republican Party
Constituent policy cannot excuse the loss of Oomam's health care website or attacks on aircraft without a pilot
Obama's 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard in the second year.
In those days, I read a very sad book.
I thought about this book that during the cold days of my second year at the medical school, he would wake me up and give me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is a reminder of the presidential campaign Baracka Obama in 2008.
When I finish the patient's surgery tonight and I go to bed, the book will bring me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people, and the visions took your breath.
The volleyballs ended with a traffic jam and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My companions cried out with joy, and my parents hid the news they had gathered.
In the White House, he targeted a young team of spectators and the people were ready to change.
During the submission to the Office in 2008, Obama had 82 per cent support.
And here I'm closing the book.
To pass into the current is a severe shock, such as to break out of sleep.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, sad memories of missed opportunities.
In the years since I entered my first volition list, it has really changed.
It was definitely nothing I thought of.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on the availability of care through the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “do not ask, do not say anything” after the death of Usami bin Ládin.
In addition, I am convinced that the foreign barriers have returned so much to the people of Cuba: it is an immigration reform among others, the opportunity for the public to choose health care and the closure of the foundation in Guantánamo.
But after a lot of situations, when I defended Obama's administration before colleagues and friends, I, in terms of an explanation that they can provide, grew to the absolute limit.
I felt political despair in the place.
The prohibitions of the Republicans cannot explain agreement with foreign leaders or with pilot-free planes killing innocent children in the sea.
They cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on American private lives, or that it monitors those who fail to meet the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the correction of Anwar al-Awláí, an American citizen, without a proper court or for limiting public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaign.
They cannot justify the discovery of reports that say that the efforts of the White House to shut down the media are “more aggressive... than Nixon's administratives”.
And the most recent cannot even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if something like this was gonna happen.
Did I know in 18 years that the power of government could be in conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it?
The popular function obviously does not have a predictable course and our public talks will create an opposition political party and the worst of events, such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above appear to be the result of the administrative decision itself.
And that's what bothers me most.
I fell in love with both of them again in 2012, but not because I was raised by his candidate.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and inexhaustible alternative and seemed unable to implement his policy or position.
I felt that the second functional period for Obama, free from the pressure of the next elections, the full hope we've ever heard of.
It is still going back to 2008 – with the support of both of us under 45 % this week – through this book which continues to be more difficult.
It's encouraging to remind me of some of the promises they've made.
This week, I read in the book a chapter about how Obama suffered from a wooden accident with Clinton in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the train and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our shirt back," he said.
We can't forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I just agree with you.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are the very opinions of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that the president of the government Tony Abbott is in the interest of the parental programme.
A billionaire and Ambassador Clive Palmer says that Tony Abbott's president is in the interest of the parental program, because his daughters can get tired and tired of it.
The Banyan Magnificent, who argues for the reward of the amount of oil at $6 million, brought this claim when he tried to move from the table to whether he was in the interest field.
The United States Party may hold up to four votes in the session to play a key role in deciding whether to choose taxes from coal and steel activities.
But Mr. Palmer said that only ministers could be in the interest field, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in position when they could have personal benefit from that policy.
"He came to a great deal of interest, if it were for a paid parent's permission, because if any of his daughter was pregnant, he should have a direct interest in getting a parent's license," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the electoral committee officially announced Mr Palmer's victory over the Fairfax Cross in the Sunshine Coast through 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of voluntary results to speed up the process.
Dr. Tony Abbotta Frances and Bridget.
Should the elections be decided two months after the closure of the polling stations?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, get details to the computer, vote immediately and have results in half of the week?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of the petition to mark the ballots.
Is it that the results can be confused if they don't like someone?
In these days and at this time, it seems incredible to be used.
The Volunteer Commission studied the possibility of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political programme was also on the airport in the Sunshine Coast and that his new work would be "very serious".
The public office is the public service.
"We do not seek any reward except that we can serve companies in this critical time," he said.
Do you have your hands?
The scientists have come to wash your hands and wash your hands.
The experiment was attended by 98 persons divided into three groups.
The first two were to deal with an unsolved role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that did wash their hands after a while made a lot more optimistic than the one where her participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with his fingers with his hands" was better than the other one in the test.
Still, those who wash their hands are more likely to produce results in other tests than those who did not.
The results of the "missed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not report any previous successes.
The results of the test show by psychologists that physical purity really removes negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, complex motivations, testing needs to focus much more on other trials.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to Czechs, we'd probably be the most optimistic after the WC's return.
After using WC, he has not had only one percentage of Czech and Czech hands, but on the road to urban transport, he is already five.
For hygiene, most people also work in the garden or in the fields when their hands reach 85 percent of the people.
A home-made snout is causing 78.7 per cent of people to lose their hands.
A recent study suggested that there is a difference between the occupation of Czechs and Slovaks, so far it is necessary to wash your hands after handing a stranger.
In this situation, the hands mix 28.8 per cent of Czechs and 40.3 per cent of Slovaks.
The study showed that both nations have their hands torn ten times a day.
"Even if it's on site, I'm afraid that the reality is different and people are trying to do so a little better," commented Dr. Claudia Komárková, a medical doctor.
RBS suspends two foreign traders
According to two persons identified, the situation is suspended by the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) by two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities regarding suspected mining machinery remains more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including U.S., Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the competent authorities in the world's largest financial market surveys, where every day they have a change of $5.3 billion.
The mention of two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the context of an extension of the investigation, which is the response to the LIBOR manipulating rate scandal (London’s interbank interest rate measure).
The Bank refused to comment, but confirmed that this month received a request from the authorities for information.
"Our non-exhaustive involvement in this thing continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other bodies," the bank announced two weeks ago.
Last month, the people who were close to this event indicated that RBS provided the British financial authority with an e-mail and a quick message from the accounts and from the former dealer's accounts.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position by the European trade president with a foreign exchange at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European President for the Stock Exchange in Citi, arrived this week, while Matt Gardiner, former trade leader in Barclays and U.S., was suspended this week by the Standard Chartered Society.
Not one of these traders was accused of any infringement.
To Mr. Usher's team, the bankers from Barclays and Citigroup were involved in sending a quick message, and the people said they were committed to this event.
This week, the U.S. Bank stated that after the Swiss Authority announced that it had examined suspected foreign exchange- market machinery in several Swiss banks, it had taken steps against some of its employees.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Anti-Monopolian Authority Weko, the FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Ministry of Justice in Hong Kong – are investigating the claim that these banks were involved in dealing with the mechanical market.
In addition, the complainants said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had submitted an internal investigation or a request from the relevant authorities.
Banks spend years with old news and e-mails to find cases of some infringements.
The investigation reports feared traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines for profit-making in investment banks in recent years, but which was disturbed by the fact that the small discrepancies made me miss the opportunity for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by claiming that it is essentially impossible to manipulate a large and high liquidity market with a foreign currency, but the high rates of traders say that this must not necessarily be true.
The high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of day-to-day trade with a foreign exchange of liquidity between various trading platforms and banks increasing their use of their own domestic platforms, it meant that “you can start having a market impact at relatively low prices.”
The report came on that same day when credit Suisse announced that this week she had left her trade department for the business of a trader who had lost about USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately inform the competent authorities and cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader is alone and that this problem has been solved," said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infected in Prague has moved thousands
Doctors in Prague have shown more than a thousand people with HIV virus.
From the beginning of the observation in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of the year, the order was confirmed by 1005 persons from the metropolis.
This is based on the statistics of the national reference laboratory for the AIDS National Health System.
According to it, there were still 2,063 students in the entire ČR.
In 396 immunosuppression disease has already begun.
198 people died.
The number of persons enrolled in the Czech Republic in the last decade is growing annually.
In 2002, the tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later they were 121.
In 2009, the investigation rejected 156 new orders and 180 in 2010.
The proposed number fell to 153, but the moon was rather a record.
According to the lab, they were 212.
"On the fact that the total number of new diagnosed cases last year exceeds 200, I think there is no mistake," said an expert on the problem of AIDS Miroslav Hlavy, who lived by the Prague House of Light for patients.
From October to the end of 2011, the tests revealed the order in 39 people and last year in 47, according to Hlavaty.
In September, 21 new patients and three patients were identified.
From the start of monitoring to the end of the HIV test, 1710 men and 353 women were confirmed.
The AIDS disease fell in 161 men and 37 women.
Most of the infected people were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to know a city should get ready for a funeral.
His visits reveal more than a walk from the centre started with memories, churches and galleries, more than he would have invented a bedrock.
A lot of people read from the graves.
Slowly, they're rolling around and getting an intimate look at the local reality.
They find out, the strong people here live here, the nations whose beliefs, the great and the compatible families, the age at which they die, the wealth, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, which they experience.
And from the state of the grave, he will find out how his dead are kept alive.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The Supreme Court in the United States decided that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the Constitution, which is the main victory for Obama's administration.
By means of vote 5:4, the Court decided that the individual regulation on the protection of patients and the available care - which provides citizens with health insurance by 2014 - does not oppose the constitution on the basis of government tax law.
The President of the Court of Justice, John Roberts, stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining portion of the 2700 pages of the law and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which states intend to extend to the possibility of obtaining non-industrial insurance, would, in a negative case, jeopardise the absence of any financing of non-performance insurance from federal sources, is not taxable and in dispute with the constitution.
The application for the closure of this Act has been lodged by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the spring of 2012, the law explicitly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitta Romney.
For the word "Mugabe is a cool osle" no longer dangerous prison, the court broke the law
To date, Zimbabwe has had to pay close attention to how it speaks to the public about the nine-year-old Mugabe, who has been ruling the country since the early 1980s, since the end of 1987.
Pursuant to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Code, the suspension of the Presidential Authority would have put an interest in $100 up to one year of deprivation of liberty.
"State representatives should not be harshly accused of people who comment on the president in the economy or in other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law protects freedom of expression.
It is likely that the British BBC was informed against the decision of the Court of Justice.
Against the law, a number of Zimbabwean injured, including Tendai Danga, was arrested by the police two years ago by the president in charge of the police in the bar.
In May, he ended up in the detention of opposition activists attending Mugabe's public service with the "Culvian Osal".
In August, the prosecutor accused a six-year-old man of his intention to use a crying with Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The Court also declared a law prohibiting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot meet the people whose declaration later appears to be unfair," said the Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
Until now the Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who has published false information to be sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment.
"The existence of a law allowing the criminalization of someone for a false declaration has a disgusting effect on the right to freedom," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe's government has been holding hands for more than 33 years, a new constitution with wider civil freedoms was adopted in March in Zimbabwe on the basis of the referendum.
The sharp steps towards the dictatorship of one man took place in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition led to the Prime Minister’s visit to Morgan Tsvangarje.
Nevertheless, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and by 2008 the world's highest inflation, which exceeded 100 000 per cent.
As a result, in 2009, the government completely broke down the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe is only paid by other countries.
The offered economy is at the root of Mugabe's unreceptive agricultural reform.
In 2000, he divided the land of white farmers between their breeders and war veterans.
Most of them, however, did not have any experience.
Central banks will keep the swap lines running
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Federation, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument enabling banks to access global changes whenever they need them.
The banks indicated it in their joint statement.
"It's a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the leading international economy of the London bank of Barclays.
"All the transitional tools of this type have become progressively permanent, so it is not in my opinion of any surprise," adds Vojtéch Benda, the main economy of BH Security.
The central banks are strengthening the momentum that began to rise in 2007, when the international credit market first closed.
The central banks' agreements enabled access to euro, dollars and other changes to anyone who needed them.
The decision of the Central Bankers comes at a time when the American Federation is preparing to conclude its programme of support for the American economy, which could remove the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract shall be used by default to overcome the lack of liquidity one change in the current transition of liquidity another change.
It can be understood as a position of one change and a loan of another change.
The ECB shall initiate a third attempt to restore trust in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed to a bank audit, the ECB will take account of 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no) does personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on the Tipsport.cz pages.
But I didn't end up here, because on the side, there was someone who couldn't finish the Internet registration.
And because I didn't want to move to another area, I lost my registration, and then I moved, and this changed my address and the number of civil service.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that it wasn't going, because I have another OP number, a address, and that it's just not going to finish and that I'm going to ask for the details and make a new registration.
So I did that and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to technical support that I would ask for the exemption of all my personal data from the database under the payment law for the protection of personal data.
On that spiritual day, she wrote me technical support that I have the registration to complete.
This started with a maraton of e-mails on technical support, where at the end of the fourth quarter of June 25.10, they wrote that personal data on my request was exhausted.
A person would then say that he could do that new registration and here start problems again first wrote to me that my username has already been covered (the understand has not been deleted - none of the personal data, but it has been ordered too).
So I used another username and jumped over to me that my personal data have already been posted to complete the register on the side (how can they have something that they already have?), so I contacted again with technical support.
On my question, how could it be written to me that personal data really cost 25.10 and to send an e-mail with that error.
I did this (about 15 p.m. yesterday) and I was registered today (31.10.2013) at 13.22, and that is why I did not do so because I used the same name and date of birth.
As for technical support, I've been in touch with them for weeks and I've decided it's not going to work.
As for the fact that if it were true what it claims (as it is not), no one could be registered with the same name or the same date of birth if it has already been registered.
Only by the way in the 13.22s did I really register, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the minded e-mail and phone number and the world of weirdness, the site appeared to me that they sent me an e-mail address to finish the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register on the same name and date of birth?
It's probably because Tipsport likes to register on e-mail and phone numbers and it just didn't tell you how he said it was.
So I sent this back technical support that they're just lying (be careful and they don't know what it says), because what it says is not true.
I added a few screens that the registration problem was still before 31.10. So "false" registration on this is just not affected.
I'm sorry, but because you're already registered, we can't verify your claims.
And communication's over.
The applicant shall repeat to the same extent that the registration is based on the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on it in the e-mail address and did not even pass.
Well, if it's hidden, Tipsport's not only that he doesn't have the data he claims, but he's still lying when he says it's wrong.
It's worse that they can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like they're on the customer's side.
By the way, after this issue was announced on my personal blog, things got a little moving, and from the Technical Support, e-mail came that the matter was transferred to the verification and I will be informed (after a week's emergency, receipt and warning on the same error).
In meters on the Museum plays music
The transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague submitted a project of the Hudba in meters.
The first festival, where during the course of the metre, the reproducated instrumental music is the Museum of Line A at the entrance to the Vaclav Square.
The experimental operation takes six months.
Michal Horaček presented his new two albums, hat and three songs
Textary Michal Horaček brought not only his completely new twoCDs Czech calendar, but above all, among us the songs of Lenka New, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla performed by Orchestra Mtéje Benka.
After the opening intru and the erection of the late musician, Michael Horaček gradually invited all three songs to the floor, he himself came to the candle in his hand and reminded the story of how the last plays in Colin and in the theater and the entire city had an electric flow.
"They made two types of cards in Colin, which I made a lot of friends," he recalled.
So did the father of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could make a tour of the Zakolons or the Dubravs in Bratislav," he tweeted about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horaček, who did not leave the library and, if he did not speak, sat in the chair with a glass of wine, touched his new music.
The calendar also did Josef Manes, who gave it to an eagle, about the ice hockey, but he didn't even know how we're gonna get into these places, and we're wondering who isn't Czech.
So it's also called one of the Czech calendar songs, but we're not playing here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang for him from this desk a very suitable bed in the day, sing after night, and spends himself with her on the guitar.
Otherwise he didn't sing, he played percussals, all three songs, then he got a cap in the composition of the piano, violonello, guitar and contraband.
All three vocalists together sang a little bit of the repertoire To the side of the heart of the seat, which immediately spread out the view.
"I'm glad that you've got this song, which didn't surprise me in Kmocho town," replied Michael Horaček.
After referring to Petra Hapku, I noticed the difference in the presentation of Františka Segrad, in the original of Richard Müller, quoted by the immense appeal, Hana Heger's statement again reminded Father of his love for the people of the Baroness and with the Horačic explanation of the Communist ban and the reward of the Baaro's American hero Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocába also recalled Sebastian's composition, and then Segrado sang a beautiful song of Praha's decorated Garden of Freedoms, his jealous parents and former Colinác.
But it was the end, the fall in position, and the contribution in the likes of the optimistic spending of our lives in a wonderful time.
One more contribution was made to the playlist, but the fans didn't give up.
About a time after the concert, the entire quarter sat on the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horaček, his books and even the apples of the legendary LP and with any interested people and photographed.
Berdycha with Stépánk is filling Rosal and Hajek
At the end of Davis' campaign against Serbia, he appointed the non-playing captain of Czech tennisists Jaroslav Returns four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štépánek, Lukáš Rossol, Jan Hajek.
Some representatives of the trophies argue, but they are playing on the hill against the Belgrade arena, where the game is actually on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the finals, the Czechs have been in need for the last five years.
"We know we're on a hot ground that it'll be wild and we have to focus as always on our performance."
"We'll go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štépanek, a winner's officer in the London final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
U.S. Army in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelites had just predicted how the Syrian bombing would look.
Without the rest of the noise, threats and millions of announcements, they sent the planes, set targets, and returned.
They would not be allowed to engage in official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
All the actions refuse to be confirmed and are no longer identified.
The exact opposite is confused and large, the actions of Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most comforting thing in all the attack was what the Israelites were threatening.
Do not be fooled by their claims that there was a "Syrian base" or "Supplies for Hizbala".
I recently wrote here about the fact that while helping US secular opponents in the country remains only on a rhetorical scale, Russia continues to deliver Syria's weapons.
And just a clean supply of Russian rockets in Latvia became the target of an Israeli invasion.
A clear statement.
And remember, Israel once again bombed Asad's regime, no matter how rebellious it should be, according to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has appointed 2 members of the spare units, probably Delta Force.
It wasn't until recently that they were registered during an attack at the American Consulate in Benghazi.
It is known that the death of two former SEALs officials who had seized the CIA area in the city, according to me, had been discussed by the CIA secret team, which was created by former soldiers.
A long period of speculation was reflected what SEALs did at the consulate or even elsewhere in the CIA's residence.
Now it's clearer.
In any event, the information that the CIA has its official protected petals in Libya (only on one of the two members of the SEALs have disappeared on the basis of a minimum), is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two years of unknown brains.
They were part of the U.S. command in Tripoli, and when they received the report of the attack in Bengazi, they volunteered to report to the warehouse and, together with five private contractors, shot their way to the CIA area in Benghazi.
The Ombudsman's administration condemns the fact that during that attack, that command was not found officially and completely and that it was simply a matter of what to do.
Commander, without orders, he'll obviously let these volunteers go.
Anyway, it's not a single-time move in the country, but the American team, CIA agents and private contractors are quite interested in the information.
And this is because until recently there has been no official recognition of anything like this, and it is now only about some NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the United States is trying to eradicate terrorism in Libya.
Even if it would help a lot more to solve the overall situation.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write today is the border of Iran.
It's not as long as the media's almost playing Iranian air forces for moving American drones.
However, we rarely know how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if they can reveal their drone in the air, nothing will be done with it.
If, however, the Iranian drone is found in the international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it turned out that the Iranian F-4 Phantom has been tracking the American drone in the international sea area when it came to the first possible deserting of the U.S. super force F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew Phantom to check his equipment optically, without recording it on the radar or just looking at it, and then when he suddenly appeared in it and called the Iranian pilot back home, he did not listen.
It's no wonder that Phantom is a flight of American products, but he remembers the war in Vietnam.
Raptor can't compare.
We want to show that Plyzen can still win, promises Rajtoral.
It's such a little paradox.
While his team in particular will not be able to produce results in recent times, the opinion of or the representative of Victoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that has led him back to the representative after one year.
He's also got shots, he's playing an activity, and after a while he's been on the roof in Teplice, he's got a back-up dog.
Victoria sold in the last two races against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but finally she took the only point from these two dolls.
František Rajtoral believes his team is breaking down with Jablonces an unacceptable series of crimes.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe Jablonec is going home," promises Frantisek Rajtoral.
The men who play an aggressive football game with the Severochs are well prepared.
It's all going to run with Jablonce, the coach prepares us well, as we're always busy with a lot of video games against.
"I believe it will be a great party on Friday evening," laments the Czech representative of the Fantastic Court of Doosan Arena.
The last tapes didn't go out like she wanted, but Victoria's word of the crisis is rejected.
So it's going in the photoball, sometimes you have a good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any case.
"I believe we'll win Friday, and it'll be good again," said the Westerners' defense.
Victoria's husband will be back in support of the fans.
"It's playing on Friday night, and that's why I'd like to invite our great fans."
"I believe we will win them," adds the Rajtoral.
Jana Five: Step back.
So I decided to step back, but when I think about it, it's not really about the step, but about the big step -- the jump of several years back, and that's to my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no care and just get out of school and get away with it, get out and do my job.
Even though these "debts," it was mostly theory, parental approval.
Praxe was completely different - to get out of school, throw a bag into the kitchen and run out.
Play games with other kids toy games, jump your ass.
Then at Helena's series and her boys, they're wearing a rare wedding ring for the baby's birthday.
And then, after a few warnings, it finally takes away, to carry the tree into the coal stones in winter, and to do the task until after sitting under the lamp (or to sit on the couch and instead of the tasks to write a favorite letter addressed to school love).
Early in the morning, you will have a home yogurt marmalade (from real fruit, not the jeans that are sold now, their contents are not even present) and you will drink it from the dried ingredients that you and your mother have so enjoyed.
I also remember those cool evenings when there was a terrible silence in the bedroom when we played songs from the radio to the newspapers that were playing aloud in the old theater after my mother.
And then we turned to the prosecutors, and we still got one of the same songs, our favorites, and we joined the symphony.
Or we called over the table by means of a pillow that was tied to each other by the procedure - and when we were on the phone, to hear better, we needed to thoroughly clean up our ears, then the more we had a syllable + wat.
The minimum maybe was more than three times lower than she is now and my parents were able to live with her so we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPadys or even cell phones and notebooks or brand-new clothes.
Clothing was born from generation to generation, and the best "handling" into the tent was beaten by three domestic products with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics, we were able to find comfort from the mentioned mom's poster, and to the maximum extent Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used on the way out just in the train on a school trip.
We've come to play more interestingly with Aunt Cloboučk Hop or Human, don't be sad, or how I've already let you go "only" outside.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, and his parents had been shooting at him for a long time, but he didn't play with us for a long time.
My younger sister threw a bullet at him, just so beautiful that she dropped those newspapers, so she tried if he fell and shot.
I'm sorry, he saved it, but it was his last sentence.
Well, and this guest's got a hell of a hell of a lot of shit on Dad's plate.
She says that when Lenka was a kid, she shot him in the video and thought she was playing a recipe and didn't play it, so she couldn't get him into it today.
I remember how we were able to communicate, talk without a cell phone, computer.
Together with our sister, we agreed on holidays in the orphanages with our neighbor when we meet again the next year in the spring in the orphanage - and so it was, so it was.
We met.
Do you have a date with someone to see you in a year?
I also remember the winter when we all ran out of town, made snowflakes, rode on a frozen cupboard in the church on the sandy sandy walls.
Then we spent an evening with the whole family and talked about the day we were late.
Of course, we listened to our sister every evening, notorically, saying, "Don't touch your hands!"
Yes, it's paid today, but you certainly don't have in the bathroom the furniture brought to the grid from lemons.
After dinner, when Dad in the garage "worked" in a beer with Jardo from the neighborhood, we slept with his mother on the floor, washed his feet about the rock rock, opened the door and looked at the ceiling and listened to the dust of the wood that was on the stone line.
We were close - really - we didn't count on how many friends we had on social networks, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn't write daily links to different chats, SMS.
There was nothing like that, and we still knew more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I add these memories to the fact that I'm looking at the album, where the black lines are made up of black photos, in particular.
And if I don't know how hard I was at the time, the photo back is always written year of recording.
I see that even though our sister-in-laws didn't listen very much, and we had a couple of more numbers on the table, no one would ever laugh at us before, it was so normal (no IN).
And I'd rather be back on that step before it's real.
By 2013, and I'll wait for what modern times will think once for my children.
What I'm sure is that these memories of me are now for the young generation so at least in some "one hundred years for the opium" and I think they're about to come up with a lot of things that don't happen in the time of this "principles" either.
I'd love to!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies complained about Nortel's patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents broken down by Nortel’s company, filed in the fourth round a complaint against producers of mobile phones, including Google’s company, a company that had been breached by Nortel’s banknote.
The company Rockstar, which awarded Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, appealed to the U.S. court in Texas, Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent abuse.
The Rockstar company is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaking seven patents.
The patents include technologies that help connect online-searched expressions with the relevant advertising, offering the application, which is the core of Google’s search-based company.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately on the move.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making calls that work on the Google Android operating system, which strongly competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011 Google made for the patents of Nortel’s company a bid of $900 million.
Google has raised its offer several times and has finally offered up to 4.4 billion USD.
After the battle against the patent Nortel destroyed Rockstar company, Google received $12.5 billion from Motorola Mobility company, which was a business motivated by a partial patent group of Motorola companies.
"Despite the failure of the efforts to win the prize of patents that are the subject of the dispute, Google patents have failed and continues to fail," the complaint states.
The Rockstar company claims to increase the compensation for damages from Google's company, as it says it leads to a deterioration of the patent on Google's side, as it claims.
Miloslava Cjepkova: Listed smiles
She came out of four degrees Celsius, which we're not used to.
First, she gave up smiles, the one who kept giving her a gun as a defense against a friendly environment.
She was very upset because it was a mask that she decided not to disclose to the public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she was pregnant and had a newborn Elin or Adík around her.
And of course, when her sons called her.
She was very well aware of the lesson from the endless course of business skills.
Now they're finally really gone.
To keep her closest.
Then he flew into the kitchen.
It's like a shift on a mask.
In November, even another month, she can't do this miracle to make her smile real, like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for nearly three years.
Egypt shall submit to the Authority of the first freely elected President
Muhammad Mursi made an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day will only bring a heavy end to political turmoil in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he was officially introduced to the office as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husní Mubarak, who was held 16 months earlier.
In his submission to the Office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth head of Egypt since the monarchy was abolished about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges brought to the black talents in a seat built with a view to the Nile, which commemorates the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We force better tomorrow, the new Egypt and the other Republic," Mursi said, in a celebration of a life on state television.
"Egypt's people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 17-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who was 84 years after his report as an illegal organization in the face of a sharp attack by individual governments.
When Murzy arrived shortly after 11 o'clock in a small car colony, hundreds of soldiers and police were stationed.
Only a few hundred supporters met before the building court to congratulate the President, and in contrast to the Presidential Show of Mubarak's period, transport was only briefly stopped so that the colony could normally make a bad trip to the city centre with its southern suburbs.
The personal prestige of Mursey, who was deliberately marked as a non-charising "reservative pneumatic" of the Muslim fraternity, was brought up by his victory and his pacific expression, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate of Islam, but also to all who want to bring an end to opposition to the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie of judges in a wooden room where he made a pledge.
Mursi later traveled to Kahir University, where he had to deliver an inaugural statement.
While he was on the scene, he received an official visit from a military captain who played a national himm.
Pritoman was the military commander of the full Marshal Husain Tantava.
His arrival was witnessed by the scandal of "arms and people are one hand" from hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as the center of secular education and later in the 1970s, it became the home of Islamic students.
Mursi made a symbolic commitment on the site of Tahrir, in a place where the revolution that ended last month with the authorities of Mubarak, and promised to regain the presidential power of his military council, which was taken from the elected leader.
But I agree with the formal oath before the court, rather than before the Parliament as usual, to appeal to the will of the army, which means that the war will continue.
Murshi's appearance at Tahrir's place was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghetto they'll be police specialists, they'll have to slow down the pressure.
In the Ghettags in Czech, police specialists should be conducted in the future.
They'd be here till half of their tracks.
They'd look at the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing the tension among the people from the poor and living in the environment.
In its proposal to reduce safety risks, the Ministry of the Interior shall count on it.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would help in particular "sustaining rapid social housing".
The document was signed by the government.
According to the analysis, about 300 poor houses and a quarter were in Czech.
They lived in them for 80,000 people, especially the Roma.
Adults were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
- We're a white-fashioned.
According to experts in problem locations, there has been a percentage difference.
The relationship between their citizens and others is widening.
In a few places, anti-terrorist attacks occurred.
The extremists also joined the locals.
Under the inside there is an obligation for the police to maintain security and order in the areas of ghetto.
The basic condition is the only "continuous application of equal access to the rule of law".
But it's not possible to achieve it without a detailed knowledge of the place and people can't.
A specialist would go to the gym, where he would spend half of his services, serve the rest of his business.
He'd look at the order in the problem area.
He would also know the locals, so he could solve better problems or obstacles.
"Thanks to this trust, specialists will be more able to carry out the whole range of counter-terrorism," the inside said.
Specialists in the ghettics would receive contributions, which is 500 to 1000 kroner per month.
The establishment of special police officers in the problem areas should be financed from the Norwegian funds.
The figure is about 600,000 euros (now a total of 15.5 million kroner).
Czech pays 15 per cent of the sum, 85 per cent of the fund.
The preparations began this year, a detailed proposal is being drawn up.
The project shall continue until 2016.
The authors were inspired by neighbors.
This mechanism has successfully been implemented in Slovenia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is not even higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roman troops here," the authors reported.
How many specialists should be in Czech, it's not clear yet.
The answer has to be given by an analysis that sets out places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also concern how much money will be allocated to these officials by the police after the project is completed every year.
According to the draft proposal, the police are taking a stand in Slovenia for the first time.
This training should be conducted annually by five tenths of staff.
They'll get the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special training for police officers who will be in trouble.
According to the authors, it would help improve the situation, especially social housing.
It should only be motivated and brought to integration.
According to the table below, there should be three categories.
The minimum standard would be met with precise rules, such as the number of persons in the room.
The average standard would be in less rooms.
The higher standard would be social housing that would be comparable to normal housing.
Investigators would have to fill in an integrated plan, which would be made up of social workers.
They should maintain the housing order, take care of their health, send the children to school, revalidate and actively seek work.
If they'd tried to get involved, they'd have reached a higher standard of living.
The progressive housing system should operate within at least 30 years until the next generation "in the prointegrated environment".
Social housing model prepares a resource for local development and work.
They have to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uglyriska top - one of our youngest bedrooms.
The peak is an ideal peak of 3 km south-east from Bruntal.
Together with a few others, the evidence of co-operation in the Netherlands is recent (from a geologic perspective).
The last eruptions here were still at the beginning of the fourth.
In view of the greater distance, there is an impressive white baroque church of Mrs. Marie Auxiliary, built in 1755 - 1765.
He won the original wooden platoon.
The guest who stood next to the church didn't keep up.
Shortly after the end of the church, an oil from four lines of lip was excavated, about 1 km long.
The cross road on the Uhllers Mountains has already been the third version, the original standing here since 1916, the second being from 2001 to 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden plastics that have produced a local artistic masterpiece, Frantisek Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the area of the Low Lake.
Similarly, the compositions of the horn from the wider area create an interesting geologic exposure.
The name of the sponsor shall be given on each stop.
The carbon peak is the rest of the young soybeans.
Although the data from the radiometric measurements is somewhat better, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
He is younger than the Great Red (old 3.3 million years) and older than the Venice Soupka (old 0.8 million years).
Sopka was born an explosion.
It has produced a significant amount of copper mixed with the carbon content from the ground that produced a reddened colour by burning.
At the end of this phase, it went out on the surface of the flesh - today it's a kind of dry chassis up to 13 meters strong.
The second outbreaks of red, brown and white tones to black tufts.
Their species are strong up to 50 meters and its part is available in the wall of the valley.
In the tuffets, there are random side puppies up to 1 m. And the second rupture was completed by cutting off the flesh.
At the end of the work from the suction, the meat, which today forms up to 50 m of the strong species of a skilled hunter.
The soups in which the mixture is mixed with the leaves are the most common type of soup.
Because they're actually composed of species, they got the name stratovolcane.
The original cosy skin was gradually depleted.
However, he was threatened by a heavy horn in the valley on the south side.
The most intense difficulties were experienced here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tuffies were added to concrete, which was then easier and had better heat-insulating properties.
The training was carried out under the pressure of experts and the public to stop and to maintain this unique place.
The problem is, however, in the prosperity and the small consistency of the horn that quickly breathes, disintegrates and sinks into the valley itself.
Lom is moving so fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, it is warm, south-eastly oriented with its ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
It's really a problem, then, but it's time to choose and maintain a characteristic geologic profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles stick to a number of important locations.
You will be provided at the top of the Uhliris, after the green tourist season from Bruntal, where appropriate from the Slezska Kočova.
Automotives can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the ski resort, where a short walk begins and begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a dance villa and a pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas in Orechovce.
The original owners of the house also received her back in return and the tenants had to leave with a small distance.
Ivana was looking for a replacement apartment for herself and her older mother.
From the famous, the guy got a 3 + kn in the old panel house on the back side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the look from the fourth floor on a large forest park and the mirror oversaw me on the other side," recalls Ivana on the first floor.
First I said it would be a three-year period.
"Today we will be here for more than thirty years and not only because of progressive reconstruction," the owner adds.
Mother and daughter then moved from one hundred twenty-five meters to a smaller area of 62 m2 and all the equipment was distributed.
The action was not simple, things were coordinated with friends, and progressive appointment lasted almost a year.
The new apartment was completely good, but they had to make necessary repairs, such as opening the door or changing the eye.
The former owner has chosen a core, and the owners are the most ineffectively resolved and extremely large in advance, and rather a small bathroom.
The union of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used to distinguish individual zones and sardrocardon compartments, which enabled the new location of light.
The first commitment that was agreed upon after a few years was to remove the curse from the living room.
This would change the availability of 2 + kk, but the room would be air-conditioned and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards a partial improvement of the standard was the refund of VAT on laminate.
Ivana didn't know the council with the bathroom.
For years, I've been collecting housing magazines and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So, on the recommendation, I spoke to a young architect named Kamila Doudere.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivana.
As a result of the construction of the bathroom, it was also possible to repair the premise.
The architect connected the WC space and the bathroom and two doors with open windows were replaced by one of the bedrooms to save the place.
The bathroom is over-time and also sufficiently free of charge.
The quality equipment imitates the bird, in the spring there is an extra comfortable seat, in the closet of the bidette spray.
Successful cooperation with Kamilo Douder continued.
Within the order of how the dream was to be made quickly, but the fundamental change in the living room, which was also shared by architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, food, housing and space to the space that caused the connection of two smaller rooms, without helping us with the classic principles of the optical work, such as semiconductor or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a deterioration of the openness and unity of the space," the architect explains.
It was originally possible to divide the space and the living part.
It was enough to turn the back of two strands and stand between them at peace with the pears.
Food quotas are interfering with remote floors and facilities.
On the ground in the kitchen and the dining room, the architect used a high quality marble, which the door restored the wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchen cup, if necessary, will cover empty panels with a wallpaper.
The new floor of the anti-allergic marble has to be removed from the laminate of a number of benefits: soft non-smoker surfaces without sleep and better sound isolation.
The sardrocarton cut-off system is an indication of how to work with space in the panel.
I left my paints on the architects, I wanted it to be happy.
"I like Orange, I had the same distance in the past room," says Ivana.
The shape of the graphite with the motive of the dissolved magnesium is practical and creates an excellent aesthetic unit.
At the warm energy tone, architects chose white, which was underpinned by modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were placed outside and into the room under the cover of a parapet.
It's all about time, the lamps are comfortablely controlled far away.
In the pre-filled interior, it works well with the new elder, for example with a 10-year-old Christian luxury and with the quality artistic objects that Ivana collects all his life.
The last one on the line came to the kitchen.
The windows were previously located on both sides, and the owner seemed a little like a tunnel.
The architect picked up their numbers and crossed the space.
The property in a simple design is made on the ban, the white surface is slightly smoothing the surface.
The small area was covered by the idea of a practical solution, a dryer, and a machete.
In view of the small kitchen, he restored the entire wall frame over the work desk.
The unique graffiti with digitally printed motivation is attractive, and it is well maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers that remind her of the favorite fourth in which she lived for years.
Now it looks like she's comfortable here too.
In the original bathroom, there was a small van and a locker, and the new owner chose the neutral distance of the suit.
A big trash bag has a broken Ronal door.
The task was to create a clear, simple space in which functions and equipment would be in harmony with the environment.
We sat inside the material and color and tried his elegant, delicate, not too full of views.
"A further condition of assignment was a minimal obstacle and the possibility of easy movement around the accommodation and the availability of daily needs items," adds Kamila Douder.
The Supreme Court decided: It can't happen at any time.
The Supreme Court decided that former Prime Minister Petra Necess could also be prosecuted for any criminal acts that might have been allowed before the Serbian separatist release.
She only protected him from processing immunity, which relates to events in Snow.
In the case of former ODS Members Ivana Fuksy, Mark Schnajdra and Petra Tluchore decided that they could not be held accountable for any criminal acts until the late November of the term of office of the MP, the speaker of the Supreme Court of Petr Knögig said.
In this decision, the Court rejected the proposal by the State representative Ivan Ištvan, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the delegation.
According to him, they have received payments in the form of lucrative positions in state companies because they appear to be a mandate and they will not make any problems with the adoption of laws.
On the contrary, they can continue to serve the former prime minister who offered them these positions.
The officer of the Anti-Corruption Police has also been detained with respect to Barto.
Bart's lawyer, Old Chudoba, who even introduced her to the VV's alleged corruption, also did not want to explain the case too much, but said, "Yes, I represent the client in this thing, but in view of the fact that I can't continue to comment on it."
According to the information, the case is resolved by the General Security Council (GIBS).
The server indicated that Barta could buy stolen information from the police.
According to the first version.cz, the case could have been related to the case of former police President Petra Lessy, whose appointment to the function of Barta was officially carried out.
The last information of the Law, however, shows that the detention of the Vita Barty with Petre Lessy is not compatible.
The speech by the police president Eva Kropča refused to comment on the fact that the Prussian city representative is absent.
"We will never comment on this question with regard to the protection of the captive facts," said the City State Ombudsman in Prague Štépánka Zenklová on Friday.
That is exactly what Bart’s plaintiff is looking at, and its words do not directly indicate that the written or criminal proceedings are carried out in the procedure of execution.
Reporter Novinek was able to accommodate his wife, Vita Barty Caterina, in the morning before their stay in Prague.
She just pulled the suitcases into the car and left.
She refused to express herself to the whole story.
On Friday afternoon, Bart's arrest was issued by the leader of the funeral of the St. Tomio Okamura.
He doesn't even know what's in the case.
"Vie Bárta was one of many candidates on our candidate, and as I said again before the elections, he was not even a member of the World's direct democracy of Tommy Okamuri," he added.
The victory of Bárta, who failed to succeed in the early elections to Snömovny in the Republic of Plzeńsk with a failure to establish the direct democracy of Tomia Okamura, is known as his corrupt cause of the execution of the Members of the public.
In April 2012, he was unjustly dismissed for 18 months with a 30-month discount.
The sentence was later changed and Barta was released.
I want a contract in NHL.
I still have tea, tea, tea and tea.
For Prospal, she was always at the family's first place, so she wanted to be fully subject to her in her 38 years.
Either he gets a job in the summer and he's still in his career, or he's definitely finished with hockey.
"I want to fill the role of fathers and husbands."
"I'm so glad of it," says a hockeyist who's still waiting for a offer.
Despite the fact that it's a declared worker who never sells anything.
Despite the fact that everyone leaves his heart on the back, he can also be a member of the team.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus in the late season.
"But the touch of everything to show in me is still," the vote is decidedly.
It may be expected that the New York Rangers are aware of it, which did not allow them to enter the season and have two more wounded oppositions - attackers Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
How does your coming to Rangers look?
They're just speculations.
Until I have something on paper, it's not worth it.
I know he sent an article to the New York Post case to sign me, but that's all.
It was never added that it really happened.
Oh, my God, I'd love to know that I have a contract, but it's just not.
They didn't even call you from the club?
Such communication in NHL is carried out daily.
That's where it's going to get to the situation when that contract really comes.
When a player gets hurt or he doesn't go to someone and he doesn't get hurt.
There are a lot of different factors that must be met together in order for me to get this contract.
But the same things happen in New York, right?
He was hurt by Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan and the team didn't go into the season, so there's a certain chance there, don't you think?
Of course, this chance is always.
But the other thing is, you always need two pages.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got anything yet.
That's the kind of horrible reality I have to live in.
On Friday you're going to America, are you expecting something to happen?
I've been waiting since June 5th when the market with free players opened in NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm sure not. I'm going to Tampy for kids and for a wife.
I'm happy to see you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
This is because I'm a father and a husband and everything is going from it.
I'm not a hockeyist right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna fill up my dad's and wife's role, and I'm much happier about that.
Your daughter's got two hockey games on Sunday, it's for me and my whole family Christmas when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-fledged imports?
Of course, a person can think of a lot of things.
And this can happen.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 pieces because of my knee surgery.
And so much and I liked it.
Once it gets to the stage, all the balls, the winnings and the puzzles don't give you what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Let's have the work you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL or because it's because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockeyist, it's the first place - apart from the family - it's also sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, then forgiveness, our children - my and my wife - grew up in the States, began going to school there and so on.
And we would be very pleased if we continued in this trend.
Because what we're going to say is that in America, there's a lot of other options.
We should offer them a chance like that.
So you're planning on staying in America?
We're going to practice it like this.
That means we'll be in Czechs in Hlubok and around Czech Buddhists in summer.
And in winter it's in Tampere or where our steps lead us.
It's perfectly ideal to be in the heat.
I had great happiness in my life.
To be told that I went against him, that's still a lot of strength and determination, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of opportunities, and this is one of them.
That we can choose our wife where we will live.
There are a lot of people in the world who yearn for it so that they can choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have in your age the will to drive, train hard and wait for the offer?
Yeah, that's the question I can't answer.
Today, I still have it in me, there's a joke, this wanton, it's an inspiration, it's a joke for this sport, and here's the touch and motivation to show people that you're still on NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it'll stay there.
It's not going to be planned.
So you can say you're waiting for this season to do it and then decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage when I'm going from day to day.
Recently, the Director-General of the Czech Republic announced that the decision on construction 3 and 4 blocks of Temelin electricity will expire at the end of 2014 or 2015.
This was due to the expectation of the new State energy concept and the agreement of the Government's Contracts of Difference.
For this reason, the current management of the Czech Republic is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - and thus to the majority shareholders.
A qualified manager, however, should make recommendations, not hide behind him.
Dad: I'm only in the government with Sobotka.
Andrej Babish is starting to point out that his ANO will not have time to teach the political movement in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government in order to get something out of it.
The President of the United Nations has agreed to this in the debate on the Law which will come out tomorrow.
Trade and marketing ŠkoFIN leads Abraham

CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The purpose was to be Russian rockets for Hizballah.
Israel’s military aircraft on Thursday reportedly bombed the military base near the Syrian port of Latvia.
With a call from the U.S. government, CNN's television was announced.
The Israeli press on the explosives in the database of the rocket was widely reported, but the Israeli government did not approve of it.
The Israeli army at the CNN question refused to comment on the plane.
"We don't agree to report foreign media," she said.
The purpose of Israel’s invasion was to provide the US government with rockets and related equipment that could be transported to the Lebanese army of Hizballah, according to the Israeli view.
The AP Agency, with a call to another US security officer, informed that the Israeli aircraft was the Russian rocket SA-125 for the purpose of the Syrian occupation.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was a fairly high modern Syrian anti-aircraft defense system.
Satellite images of the area of the attack but according to DPA agency showed the batteries of the Russian rocket type S-125 News.
In addition, she was able to see the SA-3 rocket battery, including the leading center with the radar to monitor the rockets and their targets.
The recorded rockets have a total of 35 miles [35 km] of Israel’s television news reports and could set up a 70 - pound [70 kg] weight head.
This year Israel had already bombed the supply of rockets inside Syria at least twice, the CNN and AP indicated.
The Israeli army had never responded to such reports, but repeatedly declared that it would involve any supply of weapons assigned to Hizballah or other terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successful in achieving this trend.
The company updated the annual profit rate and expected the record profit from the Australians and Great Britain.
The travel agency is now expected to move its annual basic profits before taxing between 325 and 340 million USD to 305 to 315 million from previous forecasts.
If the current development is maintained, it will represent a twelve to seven per cent increase against the record profit of USD 290.4 million in 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre created an eight-percent profit in the first half and the second half of the first half of the first half of the first half, mainly in Australian and British travel outside the service route.
"To date, our 10 countries of profits and several points to the record annual profit before rating and taxation," he said.
I belong to Australia and Great Britain, which are traditionally our biggest profits.
During the second half of Australia’s recreation activities, the supply of recreation was collected, which compensates for a slightly lower domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in Great Britain, the Flight Centre managed well in the recreation area, while business customers lost less.
The American trade has been operating since the fall of the season and is expected to lead to a number of celebratory profits.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher last night at the level of 38.20 USD.
Active Greenpeace detained in Russia transferred to Petrohrad
The ecologically active detentions from September in Russia due to the protest against planned theft in Arctic have been rehabilitated from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
She informed the AFP agency today with a call to the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
It also claims that the original charges of its pirate activists have not been reached yet.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that three-thirds of men and women detained in Russia after an infamous act against the robbery in the Arctic had been transferred from the repair facility in Murmansk to the Petrohrad prison," the organization announced in a statement.
The reasons for the transfer of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA agency, there was a planned transfer.
Economies were the first to be accused of pyrites, which, in the case of decommissioning, threatened them until 15 years of imprisonment.
Last week, however, they announced that this charge would be rewarded with a more peaceful settlement that would threaten the lower penalty with the upper limit of seven years of freedom.
But Greenpeace, in today's press release, warned that the charges of the bureaucracy have not yet been dropped as promised.
It means that arrests are now charged with two criminal acts.
The High Committee for the Study of the Last Week announced that the prosecution of the Pirate Bay would be compensated for the prosecution of the investigation.
However, when a third of the prisoners were arrested this week before the committee, the charges against the Pirate Bay were not filed.
Instead, a new charge was raised against everyone," AFP quoted the Greenpeace statement.
The Russians held in the Gazprom's red zone in half a dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise boat, which fell under the Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been involved in the struggle against which they have appealed, but the court has closed them all.
Under the conditions of imprisonment, the ecological problems arise.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidodo, according to AFP today, indicated that the transfer to Petrohrad was an easy meeting with families and consular workers.
However, there are no guarantees that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he warned.
With the help of the Dutch King Willema-Alexandra, one of Faiza Olahsen's detained activists was asked for help.
In a manually written letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called on him to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Malikí has a great share in the resurgence of sectoral violence in Iraq, which is also part of the struggle in nearby Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, legislation and grammar
In hours English literature will need to study at least one Shakespeare game, a 19th - century novel, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British beat since 1914.
The test will also include "secret text" in order to motivate deeper reading;
The combined English literature and language courses will be deleted.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a master language test and will be required to choose English literature as a voluntary subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new basis for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first items to go through radical change.
The next year will be the next year in other key items.
In a separate step, Ofqual's office, which looks at the maturity tests, reflects changes in the structure of the maturit test, along with the new system of marking and less scope of projects for students.
In his summer speech, the Minister of School Michael Gove said that he is saying that he is “a broad consensus, as to whether we need to reform our test system in order to regain confidence in society,” and that it is necessary to insist that the matrimonial test be “national, ambitious and more precise”.
The study shows that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week — more than most other countries.
To compare schools in Australia, mathematics is estimated to be 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no formal requirement to buy more math time, qualifiers have indicated that the math test, along with greater attention to this subject in the results of the survey, is likely to encourage schools to provide more education.
The educational plan will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
Ostravsk primator Kanar: Rakovinu in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, a long dispute arose between the two rivals fighting the influence of the ČSSD in the island.
Everything came to an end when Ostravy Peter Kanar turned to court for non-democratic candidates.
The complainants still did not want to express themselves too much so that they did not harm the party before the elections.
But now the voices of the voters are numbered.
ČSSD's leadership was called on by Ostravy's host on Monday evening to get out of the country, and it's obviously going to force him to come for his job.
Peter Kanar wants to go on fighting.
What's going on in the race and who's on whose side he's on, he wrote in an exclusive conversation for Denmark.
How do you feel about the result of your choice?
ČSSD certainly counted with a much better result.
Did it hurt to us that they were solved in the media in front of the elections?
I imagine that social democracy could have a better outcome.
But on the other hand, this corresponds to the situation in which ČSSD is now.
It's a side that has its internal problems, it's a disease inside, and people think it's not all right.
They made it clear in the volitions.
What are the inner powers of the ČSSD?
In the past, I think ODS has been through a certain period of time, and the same things are now, unfortunately, being reflected in social democracy.
It's so that lobbyists, influenced by people who once expected to find their ancestors in ODS, moved to the people in ČSSD and affected them.
It's related to the fact that the police go after the Ostrava Master's office and collect the computer.
This shows that ČSSD is not only composed of people who want to be good to all others, but many of them think mainly of themselves.
ČSSD is divided into two dismal camps in Prague, as is seen in the current war between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been getting ready for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a prelude to what is now happening in Prague.
The Haskova wing gradually expanded its position so that after the elections, it could develop a situation that weakens Sobot's wing.
A person is in politics in a situation where he has to reach compromises.
But everyone has some internal border when these compromises are no longer made, and that's my case.
At first, I didn't want to apply for a film, but when I thought about the whole thing inside, I agreed with Luboš Zaralk that I would try to get to the national candidate so that I could send Sobotk's chair right away.
Haskov's cross, but he's got a stop.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotky, not Michael Haska?
I think Sobotka's the man who always talks primarily about the ČSSD programme and to some extent and about visas for the party and for this country.
I admit I didn't hear anything like that on the other hand.
Michael Hashek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only start calling the Chair of the Parties.
It's a war of power without regard for everything and against the people of the country.
According to me, what Michael Haszek had now in Prague ended his political career.
How did you realize that you were not approved by ČSSD's Ostrava leadership on the candidate?
The political parties are based on competition, who will take the place of their members.
This competition should be largely based on the programme visas and the ability of these people to fill those visas.
Of course, there are also people who have no power or vision, but the political side is for them a contribution to money that they would not otherwise have.
The problem is, when these people start to get to the front, because they break the rules without breaking the rules, they break the laws of the parties.
They do their practices on the political side of the Mafia and I think they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
Warning about this problem is more important to me than considering whether there is any political future in Kenar.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the positions.
Is that why you submitted a motion to the Court for a preliminary action against the likes of the ČSSD candidate in the country of Morazkoslez?
The current ČSSD Executive Committee in Ostrava agrees with the fact that the organisation which does not comply with it can be broken down, with the aim of establishing a new organisation, gradually withdrawing members of the non-conformity.
For example, it may be that they wanted to expel Richard Bednarík from the representative's club, but he filed a complaint against it, and then they gave him a ruling on his expulsion.
This shows that maintaining the status of the parties across the court is the only option at the moment that the other methods and control authorities have stopped operating within the ČSSD, this is the only option.
The strength to lead the island ČSSD in front of the Ambassador Adam Rykalou is to call you from the position of the host.
It's a public secret that at this stage, the old man's behind Poruby Lumír Palyz.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me back.
They promise people positions, they get voices, and then they're joining their power on the side.
When I get back to the past, so all I could have played around the football club Baník Ostrava and bought the basal stadium was just a memory for them so they could compete with me.
It was kind of appreciated to be able to mark me as a man who gives money where he doesn't belong.
At the same time, he bought a property that has a strategic value for him.
So how do you see it going on with your performance as a receiver?
The Committee of the Regions has already called on me and other people in the afternoon to consider their detention in ČSSD.
But I think it's like when the thief screams: Get the thief!
When we look at the results of my work in the last few decades, I see no one in the island social democracy, who would initiate and pass, sometimes even against the members of the parties, the result of such developments as the need for industrial areas or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I don't read it unless I interrupt others so they can go to places they're looking for.
Are you going to be able to fight this again?
Because if this Republic is to function well, it must also work well with political parties.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively govern the state if he can't control himself.
So I don't think I'm leaving ČSSD now because I think that the one who's making this page's cancer is not me, but these people who are trying to test me.
Olomouc opens in the historic center of public clubs
The organizer of the Olymous Christmas Markets and the Winter Bracelet Paul Spalenj noted that the preparatory work at the monastery was started on October 26th and from the middle was in operation an aggregate on ice production.
The ice type is already seven inches [7 cm] long and the surface will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
Kluzišić has a surface of 375 square meters, the floor has been taken 358 square meters.
Bruslars and the next ones will also have two seats with a plate.
"We have expanded the floor floor, expanded the space before the walls, and almost the whole floor of the floor is closed so that the drillers can easily move over," said the Spaleny.
The streets of Ololouce are already reminiscent of the nearby Christmas.
Loni was installed in front of the main entrance to the upper room because of the construction of the lower floor.
The repair of the Low Place was completed at the end of the year, so the ice sheet could return to its original location.
At first, people could break up right before the workshop in 2009 when the club was operating from January to March.
The ice sheet then became an integral part of the summer markets in the city.
The evening markets, which are part of a rich cultural program, will begin in the Horním place a month before the Friday day.

The brutal murder of the senior in Zlinsk will be re-solved by the national court
The Court of Justice dismissed the complaints of five-year-old Slovakia and two-year-old Czecha for lack of evidence.
The men refused.
They've been sentenced to 15 to 20 years of imprisonment or extraordinary punishment.
The speaker, Peter Angyaloss, confirmed that the Supreme Court of the National Council had revoked the decision and returned the matter to him again.
The reasons brought to that court refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been granted to the parties.
Unfortunately, the young men had spent 17 years of age in his home.
Senior died of tragic death.
According to her regrets, her men were beating her, beating her whole body, as well as his armored object, apparently a blue gun, set about three tenths of the wound to his head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as broken bone bone, brain failure or bleeding into the brain that he was exposed to.
In fact, young people brought some 3,000 kroner and some 14,000 kroner in value.
According to the national court, they were the only indirect evidence against the alleged foot-and-mouth disease, which the expert assessed as not fully found within the meaning of legal instructions.
In more than ten cases, the fires from the fireplace and other things have been associated with the suspects, but the police have started with them as with permanent and non-warming steps.
In addition, there were certain errors in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, there was no evidence of any offense.
However, the court found that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found the neighbors who thought he fell down and hurt himself.
She did not even notice the violent death of a known doctor of rescue services.
Criminals contacted the oval doctors who showed signs of violent death after a few days.
The police were no longer able to work with all the steps from the place where the police had calmed down.
There was no DNA found in the place.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradštška.
Now he's been sentenced to 8.5 years by a law firm.
According to him, the man was the head of a group of six young men, who apparently had a lousy pasturage of gold.
Loupés took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopné.
Young people accused of murdering seniors live in Uher's City.
In August, 11 months later, the court dismissed him from custody.
Relaunched with a reconstruction stage
At the beginning of November, it will begin in the Winter reconstruction of the football stadium.
On Thursday the stadium was reassessed by buildings carrying out the reconstruction of the shipyard.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojme is divided into four stages so that it can meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Strong winter
The Saxofon Great and the legend of the Wayne Shorter railway scene makes the next middle of the 18th anniversary of the Spring Spring Festival.
Shorter will be released on 6 November in the Grand Hall of Lucerny together with its square in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
On the second half of the evening, the Spontaneous Iron improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmoni under the direction of Martin Kumžáka.
In Shorter works for a symphonic orchestra, Pegasus's backyard from the news album Without A Net, as well as his older stock Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although the year celebrated the 18th birthday in August, Shorter is still full of power, which also proves that the Prague concert on the Strones begins its world tournament.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than fifty years ago.
A number of the interpreters he worked with, from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell, and Carlos Santan.
On his music trip, he also met Czech singer Miroslav Vitoš and Swedish cousin Joe Zawinul, who were guided by a new style of merger in the legendary Weather Report after more than a decade.
In the last thirty years, it has been especially with Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Jakousi after the festival will still be a club night Spotlight, which will run on November 9th at the Roxy/NoD club.
According to charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the Turkish audience is presented by the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with its jacket influenced by electronic and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which brings the electrical-draft formation of the Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The customs office shall order UEFA to publish the penalties for the decision-making process.
Dagmar Damk, President of the Committee of the Co-decisions of the Photoball Association ČR, has ceased to publish sentences for the courts.
It is prohibited by the UEFA rules, which led to the discussion of the DPRK.
In the wrong case, he would be totally at risk of FACHR attacks.
Damk's also denied that she would be on the Plzn's side in her function.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Plzni, but the other members of the Commission are separated, for example from Prague.
So in the case of a vote I can play 1:6,” Damk announced in response to the criticism that broke out after Plzen played twice as penal than the rest of the league team.
Even though the FACHR has ceased to publish sentences for the decision-making process in recent months, Damkov assures that the judges are crying for their mistakes.
"Believe me that if the Commission finds out that the decision has made a mistake, it will limit it to any delay," Damk said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is according to the Danish law of the European Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and the infringement of a serious criminal offence."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have issued restrictions, but I have received two very serious warnings that if we don't stop, there will be severe sanctions," said Damk.
The other countries respect the order.
"We were really the exception," he added.
In order to continue the publication of information, the Commission could draw up funding from UEFA for the training and development of decision makers.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them we could not complete a decision-making programme," Damk added.
The arrest of Barty relates to Janousk and Belem: Do you want to attend the funeral?
The President of the General's Office of the City of Bart arrested the police on Thursday.
He was arrested and led by the anti-corruption police Jan Petrjílek.
Detainment relates to the services of Lobbista Roman Januška and former Prime Minister Paul Béma (ODS).
Information on the employees who came with the news server Novinky.cz confirmed the Czech press office a reliable source.
The phone calls of Januška and Béma, which were released in March to the newspaper Young Front Today, and in which both men speak together "Mazánk" and "Kolibrík", show the impact of Janušk's influence on the steps of the city under Bem's leadership.
In 2007, the Danish authorities indicated that the security information service (BIS) had been organized in 2007 and that two years later it had disappeared from the ABL security agency.
This is where Barta owns it.
Server Novinky.cz warned that a detained criminal named Petržílek worked in front of his approach to the anti-corruption police right for BIS.
To the anti-corruption attack that followed, Petrjílek passed at the same time when they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of information protected, I can't confirm anything or say anything," complainant Michal Muravski of the City State Department of Prague said.
He refused to confirm that the case was being investigated.
The case doesn't want to comment on the same reason.
The new public law is prepared by six companies of 10
The effectiveness of the new civil law and the Law on Trade Corporations as of 1 January 2014 shall be intensively prepared by six of the ten companies.
Only eight per cent of the company's respondents indicated that the concerns associated with the two key codes in their company had not been resolved at all.
This is illustrated by a study by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which found the views of 108 Czech companies.
In relation to the close term of effectiveness of both key codes, a number of managers are currently starting to understand how they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years also affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
As a result of policy-making, the business sector has lived in uncertainty for a long time, whether the revolutionary change will come to an end or not.
"But they have only a few weeks left to move to new rights for their companies without complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spačil, partner.
Of the 61 per cent of the companies in the new legislation, 26 per cent of them indicated that their companies had already taken all necessary measures to be prepared at the time.
More than 35 per cent of the companies concerned are seeking to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the contrary, every five companies have not yet been covered by the recodings, yet they have a specific idea as to how to prepare for them.
At least 11 percent doesn't have an opinion and the problem can't be solved.
Only eight per cent of the company recognises that the concerns associated with the recycling have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new citizen law is for the largest number of companies in question to conclude new contracts (21 per cent), followed by the settlement of trade conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the capital of property and liability for damages (by 10 per cent).
The contract reflects one of the most important news of the whole red tape, which is a combination of the revision of the contract only within the framework of a new civil law.
The current parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial law will disappear, as a result of which the treaty law should become more transparent for citizens and businesses.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, a new reform will offer a lot of newspapers with a view to greater freedom of planning of relations," Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddany warned.
With regard to the Law on Trade Corporations, it is considered to be the most important theme of nearly a quarter of the company's problem of increasing the liability of the statutory authorities.
The following are the topics relating to the admission and duration of the wave group (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legal correction means the strengthening of the obligations and possible consequences for the statutory authorities, especially in the event of an accident or an accident.
"In practice, this means that, if members of the Presidency and members of the firm are not to deal with the care of the proper economy and the non-repetition of the threat of society, they can benefit from the performance of the function up to the last two years," Spačil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop Carter's style as a living language
My task is to keep tradition and at the same time to bring our sign to modern things so that she does not remain a cursed relic, explains in her speech for the UN's position Pierre Rainer, director of style in Cartier company.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
He travels through the bay, river and jungle and provides medical care free of charge
Dr. Georges Belle offers free medical care in the neighborhoods of Cameroon.
Belle and his team heal almost every week hundreds of patients
There are not too many doctors in West Africa; only 1 in 5,000 inhabitants.
Call here or through your cell phone.
Dr. Georges Belle is one of the 10 main candidates for the 2013 CNN Award.
In 2013 you can vote for it or any other of the 10 main candidates.
The winner will get $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For the last 21 years, Georges Belle has been watching his father again and again, turning to an unknown patient who has not been trained to help him.
In 1981, James Belle was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he had an infection that had spread to his brain, and there he was created with a hematom that caused his whole life's problems.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Belle.
We'd have to take him outside Cameroon if we had money for it.
Instead, Bille spent years transporting his father to a clinic and a hospital where he received a treatment that was just available.
"It's not easy," says Belle.
You can leave home at five in the morning, go to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people just die because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Tylle's father died, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 citizens.
For comparison only, in the United States, one doctor is a 413 citizen.
And even if doctors could visit Cameroonians, many wouldn't have allowed it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the expenditure for health care in this country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Belle.
Because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Belle saw his father and many of his countries suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Belle and his volunteer team conducted 700 operations last year.
I became a surgeon at the center hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose weekend members visit the rural areas where they provide medical care free of charge.
Since 2008, he has helped his group of volunteers to help some 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people are moving to the supply, attaching to the dry medical needs and traveling to a dry area in the neighborhood that they need help.
It's not always a lucky thing.
He must immediately press the vehicle through the river and the bay.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as real gardens: the host, the music and the dance and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
In these neighborhoods, medical care is indeed a free reason to celebrate and Belle, with its wide smile and unsatisfied energy, is very willing to join the local party.
The next day, the team begins to heal hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients in every ward," says Belle.
They're coming to the village about 60 kilometers away, and it's a trap.
During each of these weeks, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and mostly transmitted diseases.
Another can get beer or gifted glasses or a family letter free – a document that requires school, but which many loved families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team's doing a simple operation under the local junkie.
The surgery usually takes place at the construction school, at the workplace or at home; after the operation the patient rises up and goes to the nursing home to release the place to another patient.
With the light from the generator, the operating rooms and the medical equipment of Belle and his volunteers work in the early hours of the morning.
It's exciting, but local singers usually help the team not to lose the motivation.
"To stay up and go on in the work, they play on the bunny all night," says Belle.
On Sunday, the team is going back to the city, tired but proud of its work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – conducted 700 free operations last year and is aware that their help can be very significant for local citizens.
One man said that after surgery, he'd be able to work again.
"It will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and surgery at the Belle hospital, she also works for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
It says that this second work is financed by about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest are covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when he actually sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and works as a volunteer for the Thalley group.
She's always in the hospital, or she's trying to get money for the organization to make this campaign.
For medical and care students like O'Malley, who come from the United States or Europe to join the Belley mission, it's a great practice that they wouldn't get home.
"Dr. Byllem, we basically washed our hands and removed blood clots or we kept our tools," says O'Malley.
You'll never live as a medical student in the second year of America.
Volunteers usually pay their way to Cameroon themselves and often come with their medical needs.
But as soon as they get to Yaounde, they're afraid, the transport and the studio will provide them with the Belle.
"There's no doubt that's a garden," says O'Malley.

Minister Holcat restored the functions of the Chief Sisters for the ČR
The main nurse for the ČR should represent the interests of healthy sisters whose number in Czech exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalized so that the health sisters of their representatives should have their representatives within the structure of the office - representatives who can always turn to what they need," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I love my sister's work, and I think that the care committee deserves to be entrusted to him as well as to the ministry.
In carrying out this call, there should be not only high professional qualifications but also human access and personal conviction.
"My pleasure and all my responsibilities will be to work out the steps that can improve the position of healthy sisters."
"We have excellent and healthy sisters in our health, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their access to patients too much to perform all the empathys and help us to improve in the eyes of the public," says Alan Schmidt.
A new named chief sister for ČR Alena Schmidt also indicated that, on the occasion of her introduction to the function, she would like to stay with different aspects of the working position of the health nurse and would like to work with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medicals and doctors.
"I don't really want to share the call of doctors and sisters, but instead I see them standing next to me, while everyone has their skills and, together with other health workers, creates a group of workers who provide health services to the patient."
"I am meeting myself with a number of problems that arise when a sister calls out, which I can't understand, and I'm willing to share in their solutions."
They include, for example, simplification of hospital and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative acts of the sisters are extremely stressful and take the time that they could and should earn better for patients," says Alan Schmidt.
The other areas to be targeted include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve mutual cooperation in the team and with the management of health services providers, training of competences and labour law issues, such as compliance with the law of work or non-compliance with their limited amount of time and place.
We often hear anonymous rumors, which are not documented in a specific case where rules may be violated.
"Where there is no complaint, there is no judge, and so the function of the Chief Sister of the ČR could serve as a guarantee to maintain such anonymity and, in particular, to allow the competent authorities to verify," says Alan Schmidt.
Ms. Alena Šmídová studied at the Secondary Medical School in the District of Health Sisters (in 1978) and at the University of Karlov University in Prague in the study program Osätöravtivė - pedagogica (in 1992).
Since 2010, it has been acting as the leading branch of care and other non-medical teams and as the recognition of qualifications for the MZČR Education and Science Committee.
During her career, she worked as a nurse in the internal department bed, continued as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she had been a nurse for eight years.
From 2004 to 2009, she served as the principal sister of the ČR Association Service.
She published a number of professional nurseries and articles in professional journals, and she engaged in preparatory work in the field of care.

Sometimes I feel like my life on this planet's hot brain.
I'd rather go on a walk and I'd be in the lamp reading books tonight.
You're talking about feelings of shame, hatred.
Was there some kind of evil in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
It's been a long time, it's been getting worse in ten years.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, I lived after that.
There's still an amazing quiet boy inside there.
I'm seeing another selfish cricket, every one in my ton of misery.

A conversation, or a better dialogue, that leads to the right and left half of the brain, often flows into the stomach and forms into the book.

You're relatively often exposed to the ego metaphorics - would you be able to define it biologically?
The brain retains all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has lived through in his billions of connections and electrochemical connections.
These woods are logical and emotionally and emotionally exposed with trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its conscious, cognitive, process, is constantly exposed to changing presence, in an inexhaustible effort to name and understand its environment and to decode important communications.

To what extent do you think of a reader, a specific person who will read your text?
The one who can't tell anything makes sense, the one who calls it science, the other super ego, I think, but it's the best Arthur Rumbaud described in friends' letters:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the word and verb formulation process."
From an early age, he read books of the old Czech adventures, sailed to the south of Captain Nema, running after the Stindales in dark streets.

Of course, I care about the views of people who take three of these roots and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, years later, they may be able to contact me on the street properly and thank me for helping them with some difficult decision in their life.
The books are actually "lifes" or "worlds".

I give an example - in the town of Red Kostelek he lived (and I hope he's still alive) one cucumbered bookkeeper (also known as Červenka), a happy campaign and a good girl's life.
On one Friday, he presented me with a few articles from my book Houštin.
I looked them in their eyes, and then I was shown a broken, read copy of my book.
I put down a broken window in my pockets, and I cried a few times.

Both of them belong to health care
Following a series of criticism yesterday, President Obama concluded from his frequent repeated and ambitious promise that “if your health program likes you, you can leave it.”
With a call for hundreds of thousands of notifications from the Republican suppliers, the President of the United States has accused the public of stealing in recent days.
Last night Obama disappeared from his original word.
"A large majority of people who have functioning health insurance can leave them," he said in his statement in Boston.
In view of what he called "the media riot", Obama called the Americans who received this notification to seek new market security.
Most people will be able to have better, more complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
Its administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the citizens who bought insurance themselves may be required to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on the care available.
"I say this to the Americans at the level: you deserve something better," said Sebelius in his statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who is considering the implementation of the Law on Access to Care, said that the downgrading of the Internet market has been a "bad".
"I am ashamed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
The Controversy of Sebelius, who captured the busy microphone, yesterday addressed to the council next meeting of the Committee, which took place following a heated exchange of views with the Republican Billy Longe, representative of Missouri on whether she must also join Obama's care programme.
More than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius' return, he asked why the "architekt" of the available care law did not voluntarily give up the government of sponsored insurance, and did not purchase a program via HealthCare.gov, which now engulfs millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy operator O2.
Both companies have confirmed and, according to the most diverse sources from the agency and from the back office, are already hand in hand.
The transaction notification should still be received in November, probably before the start of the LTE network frequency auction, then before 11 November.
Keller's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
This was released under the flag of Sazka Telecommunications into the LTE network frequency auction.
And to the general surprise, it wasn't until the company was able to reach out to telecoms.
Only Sazku now leads a very experienced telecoms mouse Robert Chvatal.
He started as the marketing head of Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovenian T-Mobile, and later the head of the cancer department of the same operator.
The bag's playing a couple of cards right now.
She went to the auction and now she admitted that she wanted to put down a virtual machine in Vodafon.
And he gives it a logic.
If the auction succeeds, you will be able to transfer existing customers from your own virtual operator to your network.
This would probably not be the case because of the normal circumstances of Vodafon, but according to the information provided by the Economic News, this could be part of much more cooperation between the two companies.
Waterphones are currently under the agreement of competition operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will fully share their network.
Waterphone needs a partner like that.
And it could be a Sazka.
If it succeeds in the trend on the LTE network (as a novelty can attract a specially defined spectrum), so the Vodafone must not be allowed into the auction at all, it will not be able to perform only a limited spectrum (not enough frequency for all).
The Vadaphone can also share the network with Sazko.
Vodafone leaves Sazku to its 2G/3G network (e.g. the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the firm to start the network quickly.
The gap between this and the LTE network, which will also be able to use the Vadaphone, will start.
They can be both companies.
The money saved could then be lost for some of the suppliers of a strong internet or cable TV.
What about Kellner?
The buyer of the Czech and Slovenian O2 (Slovenian province is the daughter of the Czech Republic) would get the full value of the operator with the full success and the wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mollusk that's gonna be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would already get Kellner for O2 and very likely in line with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share the network.
The auction could ultimately end with success, but probably not with the high amounts on which the state budget is pleased.
And since next year, customers in Czech could choose between calling with Vodafon, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komkark.

Is Czech TV ever covered without signatures?
In the summer of President Zemana, a legendary scene with a doll is not difficult to listen to the difficulties that gather evidence of the cross-country crossing.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslava had not been documented in such a way as to sign it.
True, the leadership has stopped the editors.
The above-mentioned cases do not answer the question, since the attractiveness of some journalists to the country's breeches - whether it is a direct reaction to the order, or to avoid using vulgarism, a typical phenomenon of unsatisfied empathy.
And if we are already assuming a general trend, we can't give up the question of whether the change in television rates does not affect others, at least indiscriminate potential interests that have not yet been available.
In fact, there are those who say that in successful countries there is no way to get involved in policy intervention.
The fact is also that this does not mean that there would be no public media difficulties.
The complainants do not question their independence.
Rather, they criticize what they consider to be the tendency of their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and we don't have this situation.
But it may also be in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, blackmailed stories of bad politics and good newsmen are more comfortable than the more complicated description of the invisible situation in which the conduct of many imperfect human beings is at stake.
JAN JANDOREK: The curse of this country: President of the country of power
It is almost a rule that in key moments the Head of State has not been in such a way that it can meet its State obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have experienced the end of his presidential period and the events around Munich would have been a little different.
We would probably not win the war, but after a symbolic confrontation, the plane could fly across the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed and the government could get to London right now and not fight for its legitimacy there.
And especially from this capital would not have the people of the cocovin today.
You weren't a stateman and you were still in power for Minichov, but for the war, it started with him from the head, and in the 48th century, he acted on it.
In order to do something better, he could go into exile and undermine the legitimacy of the communists and their victims.
Hach's bad to talk about.
They called him "the President is not going to get to the situation that he would solve."
Only he had to, even though a big decision was not made with a knife on the church in Hitler at the office.
In March 1939, the chief of the research, Frantisek Moravec, said that everything should be done so that the occupation, which he knew about the day, did not go so smooth and with such a profit to the Germans.
The Senate president and the bailiff government didn't do anything, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human trolley Gottwald let his flight crew be repaired, as Moscow showed him.
The People of the Freedom definitely failed to share in normalization and had to sit with him, already, all of a sudden.
That Husak was a weak and sick depressive old man in November 89, but that's the only complaint.
Havel was lucky that he hasn't been in the office in the last few years, he was cured the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis player, but many of his actions make it clear that thinking processes are no longer what they were.
Well, now we've got this.
The head of state and the senior commander of armed forces seems to be, and we still don't know everything.
Unfortunately now, there is no threat to the external threat of the Republic.
Or maybe it's dangerous, but it's not like that.
Then the question is whether it is absolutely not (from a historical point of view) good that the president is not entirely in power.
It's a normal situation, but it's not.
Can't we choose someone who's friendly and healthy again in this country?
Remote planets, black films or some fantasy about foreign life on earth are not the topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would call ice cream.
In the celebration of his quarter, which on November 6th, in the large hall of Prague, Lucerny finished the annual festival of Struny in winter, which is all connected with everything.
The quarter of Wayne Shorter's chess saxophone is the current feelings of musicians.
According to his mission, two generations of younger colleagues are playing what they just enjoy.
They have access to music as a fully improvised domestic activity and have nothing to think about harmony or rhythm, not even in film images.
This principle is also a purely eight-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-gram player, some co-player Milese Davis, and today the biggest live jazz saxafonist - does not want to explain.
He does not talk too much about singing, although his overall view of life is related to singing.
In my 80s, I came to the conclusion that it's best to let it go with my life.

How the Muslims from Thailand raised the markets of the Paris Bar
Maybe you're sneezing over the smile and then don't worry that you're taking it half kilograms a year, you're just willing to eat.
For example, it's ground in the brain.
If you consume it wisely, then you are significantly trendy: it is organic, viable and you have also stored on the unique experience.
The offer of a smile was first arranged in Paris on the food list of its company at the beginning of the reign of Elie Daviron, the cook and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
Bar, for whose name was the inspiration of the book William Burroughs Nahý meal, you would find in the fashion 18th of the near Montmartru, a rather visited tourist.
With a clean lawyer, breaded red peppers, cheese and creamy eggs, the guests can taste more than all kinds of herbs, vegetables or water broccoons, and enjoy themselves there.
Supplies (to prevent the smile from hurting the skin, the legs, or the eyes from harming the eye) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe first learns to eat humour, otherwise it's common.
The owner of the Paris bar with the popup menu immediately gives a few reasons why to consume just a smile.
The first of these is the ecological benefit because the production of moisture is much less expensive for our planet (such as finance, space and water consumption) than the traditional mass.
"It is also an excellent source of protein and omega of 3 fatty acids," said Daviron to Reuters station.
At the same time, a young cook does not stop his profession, simply prepares to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant of pleasure, sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I don't save the world, I'm just putting on a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be able to imagine how it consumes the broccoli of a favorite dog, but the reaction of the customers of the Paris bar to a served smile is very positive according to the owner.
Even the skeptics will finally enjoy it, even when they start with the smallest cheeses and until they finally choose the scorpion.
The prices of these gift plates shall be moved from five to nine euros.
President Václav Matáš Václav Matáš: I should continue to support the new green support
Since 2008, the Czech construction has been facing a continuous decline in the scope of the ban and the State is not interested in resolving the problem of the investment building.
The announcement of the New Green Support Programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the measures have been implemented, have reduced significant amounts for printing, but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of construction materials.
Each invested billion will bring the state more than 2700 new jobs created.
In view of the state's fiscal policy, there are significant package and multiplicative effects, including one of the most significant enlargement measures.
It is therefore in principle incompatible with the government's decision and calls for the implementation of such steps which would enable further continuation of the programme to be made possible in its framework for further challenges.

John Kerry, in his no-believing confession, said that the American spy "go too far"
John Kerry pointed out the deterioration of the United States' defence situation with regard to his monitoring programmes, and in his prior admission, he said that in some cases the spy “has gone too far. ”
The Foreign Minister also acknowledged that, along with Barack Obama, he was responsible for the fact that, in view of the reputation of the spying activity of the NSA, which appeared thanks to the informant Edward Snowden, they acted as a "autopilot".
Public information has created a diplomatic conflict between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video-link to an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have really learned about some things that are done with patience because this was the opportunity, with reference to the second world war, the difficult period of the war, and then of course 11 September."
He thus became the first high-ranking member of the American government, who acknowledged that the American spy crossed the border, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases it has gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to people, and he is now conducting a thorough review so that no one should feel that it has come to an end.
I assure you that this process does not lead to abuse of the rights of innocent people.
However, Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA's organization was doing good and that her monitoring operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are going to be confronted with a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves.”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is strongly committed to killing and throwing people into the air and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to hold it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we've prevented the planes from falling, the buildings were not blown up and the people were not repaired, because we can learn about these plans before.
The president of the Senate's Committee on European Affairs on Thursday said that the American legislators were coming to Europe to respond to the concerns of foreigners concerning certain American spies, and convinced Europe that they should continue to join their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others and that they cared about their concerns that he would stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because they were disappointed with the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe remain on one ship with us, in view of the joint efforts to combat terrorism, said in a discussion with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and president of the Senate of Foreign Affairs for European Affairs.
And I intend to go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together with terrorism regardless of their impact on the NSA programme.
The news in the media that NSA has collected millions of telephone records in Europe has damaged relations with some American associations, although the head of the agency said this week that they have been inexplicable and reflect the meditated metadata that NATO associations have collected and shared with the United States,
Further details quoted documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angely Merkel and some 34 world leaders.
The director of the national report, James Clapper, denied the connections as necessary and said that he was one of the most common concerns.
Meanwhile, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to be carried out this year and hoped that the members of both sides and chambers would appear in the delegation.
The following days, the names of other lawmakers who are willing to join shall be published.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to help make a relationship, he added that they would be prepared and that "goodly reduced emergency measures would be taken".
He said that the European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs that they use for years themselves.
"While we manage our monitoring programmes to better protect European rights, they also need to know that we are not the only ones who are doing spying here," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is planning this weekend on the Middle East and to Poland to respond to the non-violent response to American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the American follow-up.
Australanca refused to stay in the Thai prison.
A 17-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to fifteen-day prison on the island of Phuket, when she wrongly claimed that she was attacked by a cab driver, refused and was released.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused by the Dutch judge on the island of Phuket of a guilty charge when the Thai police said that the taxi driver, along with two other men who had previously detained her, attacked her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10.
However, a record from industrial television later disappeared that after she had been divorced with her Australian friend, she was safely back to her hotel.
Police from Phuket Island conducted talks with Bamford two days before she found out she was thinking about coming.
Before the trial, she was held at the local police station.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-risk facility in Phuket, instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
He is the daughter of former Australian law player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of his daughter, asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family had "extreme concerns" about his daughter's judgment and wanted her back to Australia.
"Of course this is a very difficult period, but we hope that the first time we will be back safely," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the verdict and was released to a prison of 50,000 baths.
A report from Australia states that, among other things, she has been taking part in a recreation area of the Caribbean in southern Thailand.
The legal source in Thailand claims that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but it was first warned that the appeal could lead to a court order which would increase its punishment and lead to imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent assassination of Australia's travel officer Michelle Smith, in Phuket, Thailand can also try to create a shameful picture for tourists, which could just remain a free gift.

It is not only the parties that have not even been reached in the parliamentary drama (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally ČSSD because of their internal circle.
Politicians served us instead of Christmas candles for the weekend.
In the wake of the election, Andrew Babies became the target of a campaign that forced voters to change the existing political style of the government.
The dispersion of the voluntary outcome and the dispute on the winning side is political (z) because of Mr. Miloše Eartha, without the consent of the voters, who have publicly supported the country's president, nor have they elected the MPs.
The Network President has lost a strategic leap in the face of other policies because of unpleasant events, but he still has a number of ways to get it back - for example, to choose a future Prime Minister.
While ČSSD's chance of getting a prime cross in my eyes, the businessmen of Andrej Babiš are approaching.
The voluntary development is still far away from the rapid and smooth creation of the stable government, but compared to the pre-favourable scenario of the left government of the ČSSD supported by the communists, this development for business in the PRC is still a better message for the economy.
In view of the ANO's vote to be joined with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (total 111 Members).
In view of the breakdown in the ČSSD, which has become a non-reading and weak party in the interpretation, the result of the coalifications may be sufficient for the ČSSD.
The minority government of ČSSD, composed of "non-residents" in the City, will certainly not go.
In addition, any government to which ČSSD will be involved will be threatened by the unwarranted ambitions of many social democracies, which can lead either sooner or later to another divorce on the side.
So I ask myself, "Are we not able to get ourselves to another early vote?"
Other elections would be more than a referendum on the strength of the UN mandate.
ČSSD's plans for the implementation of sectoral taxes, a more detailed increase in revenue or the construction of state banks were hoped to fall below the table.
ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and the creation of a consistent example of business support, high fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), employment support for disadvantaged persons, lower rates of DPH in the selected product.
The third spheres are made up mostly of the social policy and the size of the state.
The ANO has a plan now, so the program is still the most likely ANO coal, ČSSD, KDU-CHSL would continue to carry more transport.
What I'm looking at is finally a better result than a left-handed program with the tax on everything that's still going on in the economy.
