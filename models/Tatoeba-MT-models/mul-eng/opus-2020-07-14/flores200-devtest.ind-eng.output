On the other hand, it is difficult for primate with a system such as humans to meet the needs of amino acids from the available sources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious vision, namely growth depression, kidney failure, and finally death.
The easiest source to use is protein in the soil and in the branches, but it's hard to open for primate like us, unless it's eaten.
On the other hand, animal food (semulence, rye, etc.) is not only easy to digest, but also a high level of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
"In view of all of this, we should not be surprised when our grandmother's mother beats the "protein problem" in a way that is almost the same as the chimpanzees in everything right now."
