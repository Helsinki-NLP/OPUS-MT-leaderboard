Members of the Wallis National Assembly are afraid they will be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly, it was the effect of a change in the title of the members of the Welsh Parliament (Ang. Member of the Welsh Parliament, in the short form of the MWP).
The idea arose in connection with plans for the change of assembly in the Wallian Parliament.
The members of the assembly on all sides of the political scene are worried that they can become the subject of kpin.
One of the parliamentarians of the Labour Party expressed concern about its group, saying that the new name is covered by the words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers in Walli: the word “twp” means stupid, and the word “pwp” is a departure.
One of the politicians of the Plaid Cymru party said his group was "not satisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Wally Conservative Party said his party was "open" to change the name. However, he pointed out that the word "MWP" was very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the letter "w" is spoken similar to the letter "u" in the English Yorkshire dialect.
As part of the Commission's meeting, which is currently working on the draft Law amending the name, the following opinion was adopted: “Of course the final decision on the future title of the members of the Assembly will be theirs.”
The Constitution of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultations on the proposal, and the change in the meeting in the Wallisski Parliament received extensive support.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal to amend the title of the members of the "Valiski Parliament" to the English-language WMP, although this short "MWP" was the most popular in society.
The members of the assembly offer alternative solutions. The difficulties of reaching consensus are the pressure on Elin Jones, the president of the Assembly, who should be presenting the draft legislation in the coming weeks.
The Constitution implementing the reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the Assembly works, including the principle of withdrawal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the legislative debate.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the country's name
In the near future, the voting will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The general vote will help to highlight the decades-long conflict with neighbor Greece, in which a region called Macedonia is located.
The Court of Justice in Athens has long claimed that their northern neighbour's name constitutes territorial expansion and has repeatedly opposed the attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia and the opposition to the referendum on the change of names, said that it would facilitate the results of the vote.
However, Plebistic volunteers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary in order to enable the state to join the European Union and NATO.
Calls in the New York Church of St. Marcina milk in connection with the problems of the church in Harlem
"The older people I talk to say that it was possible to find a bar and a church every year," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There is absolutely no trace of them."
As he says, the destruction of the bars is understandable.
"People are currently making friends in a different way," he said.
"Baries have ceased to be a regular meeting of the members of society."
In the case of churches, he is concerned, however, that the measures resulting from the sale of property are not sufficient for the length of the decision-making period, and that “after or later they are at the point of departure”.
He added that the churches can be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who will not support the rest of the churches.
As he said: “The increasing majority of the people who buy houses in such buildings will be white, and this will speed up the entire closure of the churches, because it is unlikely that the new inhabitants will become members of these parafia. ”
Both churches were built by the collection of white believers, even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Marcina joined the community a decade later).
The first collection of white methods left the department in the 1930s.
The Afro-Americans' round-up has now passed the property right to the building.
The Church of St. Marcina was taken by the assembly under the leadership of Major John Howard Johnson, who fought against a salesman from 125 Street (main street in Harlem) who opposed the employment or promotion of the Africans.
The fire of 1939 seriously damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson’s paraphibation took place in the wake of the rebuilding of the temple and healed the building of the sound system.
The great David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in the church of St. Marcina, has in mind called the new chariot “the voices of the poor. ”
The expert who called in July described it in a different way: "cultural treasure" and "replaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also noted that it is the first career in the world served by black music. It was the artist Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the Riverside Church, where he was expected to be a larger group.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Marcina's church didn't replace him.
In the last few months of the Church of St. Marcina, a number of complex events with the participation of architects and performers took place by church leaders and part by the tens of Episcopal Church.
In July, the paraffin council (the paraffin agency composed of the Swedish leaders) voiced its concern to dozens, claiming that "she wants to throw costs to the council", although the Council did not take part in the employment of architects and performers sent to the place.
Part of the paraffin of the nose is also due to lack of transparency on the side of the diet.
Rekin was injured by 13-year-old hunters looking for homer in California
The authorities found that on a hot Saturday the river attacked and wounded 13-year-old hunter in search of homarins in California.
The attack took place about 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel brought the KSWB-TV station to San Diego on Saturday morning, about half an hour before he heard a call for help. Suddenly, a group of friends moved to the boy to help get him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy had been raped by a homarus, but he soon felt that the child would cry: “I’ve been hurt!
I've been bitten!"
After his visit to the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely broken skin around his grandmother.
"I started to cry to all to escape from the water, "The river is in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the child's Council Children's Hospital in San Diego. His condition was defined as critical.
The cancer of the cancer responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that the fish had been caught a few weeks earlier, but it was not known that it belonged to a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim found serious symptoms of the top of the tube.
In order to conduct the investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed access to the beach from Porto Beach in Casablad until after Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that the area is inhabited by more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's network plans to expand activities on the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network throws a glove with a stick such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, bringing into its supermarkets cosmetic work related to the style of shop houses, as well as especially high school salesmen.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market – which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly growing despite the losses in the fashion industry and domestic economic articles – 11 decisions on the network will show more control over cosmetic products. The next year’s initiative will be extended to the following points.
The return to the space industry results in the search for ways to manage the area previously occupied by televisions, microphones and home economy articles.
According to Sainsbury's network, two of the number of cosmetic products will be offered and even 3 thousand articles will be offered. For the first time, goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw appear.
Currently sold brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more places and different areas close to these famous boats.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its offer of products to Boutique makeup. From now on, most of the articles will be accepted for the occasion, which young customers often meet.
In addition, the perfume Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sansbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second will be in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, in the later year.
The generality of internet sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores makes supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, President Sainsbury's, said that sales points will be increasingly reminiscent of stores because the network is trying to fight discontinuity, such as Aldi or Lidl, by providing more services and products than food.
Saninsbury's has placed the Argos network points in a set of stores and has introduced a number of Habitat network points since the transfer of two companies two years ago. According to the company, this helps to increase the sales of food products and increase the profitability of investments.
The previous attempt to reorganise activities with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended with a breach.
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Saninsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, cooperation was completed following the conflict on the division of revenues from the supermarkets.
Saninsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 appetizers of Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy network, a total of 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to Lloyds' comments, the plan will help to achieve an extended range of luxury marques to fill the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four layers of the network.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Saninsbury's business, said: "We have improved the appearance and nature of cosmetics in order to improve customer exposure.
We invested in special training for employees so that they could help the consumer during purchases.
Our brands are able to satisfy all needs, and friendly surroundings and suitable locations allow us to pay attention to customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the timely ways of making purchases."
Peter Jones "swift" after Holly Willoughby's release from the 11 million-pound contract
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den television program, was “swift” when he found out that Holly Willoughby is going to spend 11 million pounds of his lifestyle brand to engage in a new partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brands offering accessory and household business articles called Truly.
The activity was immediately compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old president announced his departure this morning through the Instagram service.
She proposed a decision to release the well-prosperifying lifestyle brand and to join the new partnership with Marks & Spencer and the ITV by Holly Willoughby, Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den program.
As a source, Peter Jones was “swift” when a popular television presentation announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting in his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts of value up to 1.5 million pounds, it would not have time to devote their March to the accessories and articles of Truly's domestic economy.
The company was previously compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop. It was also supposed to double Holly Willoughby's property worth 11 million pounds.
After the announcement of a decision to release Truly's brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby in the Instagram Peter Jones left Great Britain, heading to one of his flying houses.
As a source: “Marca Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She joined her future and wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the operation completely interrupted all the persons involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to entering the market.
Stores are ready for sale in Marlow."
Experts believe that the rejection of this Morning programme and one of the most successful stars in Great Britain can cost the company millions of dollars from significant investments in products – including the post-war articles by the world by the clothing and household economy – as well as further delays in entry into the market.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin have maintained close relations with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby joined Tara Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them at the presidential position.
The couple ran together, and Jones included 40% of the participants in the TV company in Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby has to be a M&S ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin in the role of the I'm A Celebrity program at the ITV station.
“ We will not comment on his business matters, ” said Peter Jones.
Hard to talk, "and then we fell in love with each other."
The president drew attention to the media criticism that some considered to be “a man-made state” as well as a positive relationship with the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump said with a smiling voice, hitting the television presenter:
"I didn't give anything."
The president pointed out that Kim Dzong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting was held in Singapore in June and was interrupted by a large step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are delayed.
More than three months after the Red Cross in Singapore, Head of North Korean Diplomacy Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday a world leader at the United Nations General Assembly that he does not see "a similar response" from the United States to the former activities of North Korea aimed at disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States supports sanctions and repression.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We have a great deal of peace with North Korea," he said.
"We planned a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Dzong Une brought positive effects: they led to the end of rocket tests, helped free the hostages and returned the rest of the American army home.
In addition, he defended his inappropriate approach while talking to Kim Dzong Unem.
"It's easy to act after the president, but instead of 10 thousand people waiting outside and trying to get to the closed stadium, we'd have 200 people here," said Trump, pointing his back in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
Three thirds of the countries on the island of Lombok were told by a foreign organization that they did not need assistance.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head by more than 10% of the residents of Lombok, the authorities did not announce the food chain, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid activities.
"In many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so the situation is difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organisation is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, there is no doubt whether an international staff will be able to operate at the event site.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a national food-care agency spokesman, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palau to see if aid should be granted by international organisations.
In view of the persistent floods in Indonesia, the country remains totally unprepared to meet with the forces of nature.
Although protected in the province of Aceh, they are rare in the case of the rest of the coastal line.
The lack of acid protection against tsunamis in Paul’s city — despite warning — likely had an impact on the number of victims of death.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travel between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
The clichés of animals are becoming more and more difficult for logistics.
The hospital's vessel, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is measured with the help of the sacrifice of the soiling to the city of Palu. However, you will have at least three days to reach your goal.
President Joko Vidodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure at the main point of his campaign and has appointed many funds on roads and roads.
However, in the light of the future elections, the President's administration is in a state of need.
In addition, Joko Vidodo found himself under the pressure of religious pressure in the country. Members of the majority of Muslim society adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of people lost their minds as a result of the struggle between Christian and Muslim gangs using macets, swords, arrows, and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool driver Daniel Sturridge gets a remiss on the game with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge ran Liverpool before the escape from Chelsea in the English Premier League, gaining a flag in 89 minutes of the Saturday game at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge was given by Jerdan Shaqiri in a distance of about 27 metres from Chelsea's border at 1:0 a.m. on his team's side.
Before sending the arrow to the far edge, he moved the arrow to the left leg.
The arrow went high above the military field in the direction of the right top of the seat.
Then she fell into a trap, moving over her vengeful head to Capa Arizabalag.
"I just tried to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to do it as best for the future. I wanted to give myself the best shot," Sturridge said in a report for LiverpoolFC.com service.
"I've noticed the approaching Kante, I've taken the bullet, and I've left the gun without a deeper stop."
Chelsea conducted 1:0 in half a match after the Belgian star Eden Hazard shot at 25 minutes.
The Niebeis attacker hit the fifth to Matthew Kovačia and then fled to Liverpool.
Kovačić was quick to take the injection into the medium of the god.
Then he performed a beautiful rehearsal for the future in the field of corn and returned to Hazard.
Hazard betrayed the defenders and left the trail towards a long-distance bullet that passed through Liverpool's shoulder, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet with the Napoli club at the master League in the middle of 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet with Videoton in the people of Europe UEFA on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian Food Chain Agency presented in Sunday morning, the number of recent earthquake and tsunamis in that country increased to 832 people.
During the conference, the agent Sutopo Purvo Nugro reported that as a result of the fifth earthquake of 7.5 degrees in the Richter scale, many people were trapped under the grunts.

The police arrested 32-year-old man suspected of female harassment.
After finding a woman in the town of Birkenhead in the town of Merseyside this morning, an investigation into murder was made.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with the legs of a rock in Grayson Mews on John Street. She was arrested for murder of a 32-year-old man.
The police ask for contact with persons living in the surrounding areas who have seen or heard any suspected incident.
Brian O'Hagan, Commissioner of the follow-up survey, said: "The study is in an early stage, but I would like to contact all the people who are currently living near John Street in Birkenhead who have seen or heard anything suspected.
I will also return to all drivers, and in particular to taxi drivers whose registers could lose useful materials during the investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman lived in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the house.
In the afternoon, people who held that they knew a woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
The police reported that it was in the process of informing the victim's family of the incident.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews recently tried to get to the apartment building. However, the police were informed that the entrance to the property and its release was currently under ban.
He was curious when he found out what happened.
The residents were informed that they would not be able to return to their homes in the near future.

Cromwell's memorial before the British Parliament, the last victim in the competition for "recording history"
The reminder would bring justice to remind the Taliban of the destruction of many English cultural and religious wastes by its radical, Puritan allies.
However, the Cromwell Society's association described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "salvation" and "the attempt to write history again".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society’s Association, said: “The ongoing debate on the removal of memories, the idea of becoming Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace, was a matter of time.
In the course of the English Wars, there was no harm or harm done by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his predecessor Thomas a long time ago, it was decided not to punish Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell's memory, testifies to what his opinion was about this policy in the 19th century and that for many people, it is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in a report for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell has been watched by many people – perhaps partly in the 19th century than today – for the defense of parliament against external pressure.
The assessment, as far as the trauma is concerned, is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the 17th century created further development of our people, and Cromwell is a well-known position, one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as the Lord of the Protector are also worthy of consideration and consideration."
In China, the death of a farmer by swine has resulted in the death of a farmer
As local media produce, in the southern and western part of China, there has been a deadly plague on the farm.
On Sunday, the newspaper South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found dead and with a broken stomach near the bread in the town of Liupanshhu, in the province of Kaeča.
The pig is ready to carry out vaccinations in Qinghai, China, on 30 May 2005, in Xining City.
According to the authorities, the man came to the market with his cousin from the nearby Junan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next branch of the kitchen found a male body and noticed the door open to the nearby bed.
He said there was a lot of blood on the stomach.
The section confirmed that it was about 250 kilograms of wine that caused the farmer to die.
"My cousin's legs were buried and buried," said a man named Uu quoted by the service Guiyang Evening News.
On the material from the surveillance camera, Yuan came to the target on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The trade manager told the service of Guiyang Evening News that during the collection of evidence by the police, the request was withdrawn in order to avoid further attack.
According to the reports, the male family and the Turkish authorities are negotiating the death penalty.
The cases of swine attacks on humans have already been reported, although they are rare.
In 2016 he attacked a woman and her husband on the farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years ago in Wallia, nearly 300 kilograms of wine brought a farmer to the trailer. A man's wife managed to pull the animal off.
Following the harvest of a farmer from Oregon in June 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but blood loss can lead to brutal behaviour.
"They just want to play.
They're like very sensitive to nothing... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just have to show due appreciation," he said.
The rest of Rosa's invasion causes intense floods in the south-west part of the United States
According to the projections hurgan Rosa loses her strength, moving over the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In recent days, however, it has caused intense flooding in northern Mexico and the southern and western parts of the United States.
Huragan Rosa is about 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 a.m., he was offered category 1. He was found at 620 km south west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to the forecast on Sunday, Rosa will move north.
In the meantime over the Pacific, it begins to form rather than heading east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will be approaching the California Peninsula as a tropical bridge, moving the masses of wild air north, to the south-west United States.
On Monday, it will take up to 25 cm to the part of the territory of Mexico.
In the coming days, the tropical winds that come into contact with the nearby bottom cause the floods in the southwestern United States.
In some places the heights of 2,5 to 10 cm are due to urgent reasons, the displacement of pollution and possible damage to desert areas.
Tropical winds sometimes cause damage from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour. This is especially true of parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even from 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some South-West regions of the USA, especially most of the Arizona.
In view of the wide-ranging nature of tropical wastes, there are urgent reasons for changing conditions.
In the light of the threat of tropical rain, the determination is reflected in the movement of sand through the desert.
Oil chips can change cannons in the rivers, and bubbles with pipes cause local winds to rise and move dust.
It is more likely that local floods will cause floods on the southern coast of California.
A total height of more than 1,3 cm can be laid down, resulting in a small movement of pollution and dangers on the road.
It would be the first floods of this time in the region.
The tropical rain forests begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and on Tuesday, they will take a larger number of areas.
On Tuesday, the Four Corners region is filled in the western part of the United States.
In October, along with the cooling in the Arctic region in all the United States, temperature changes can occur. However, in the Mediterranean area, there will be more heat.
This may lead to a sudden change in temperature in small distances.
A good example is the weekly differences in temperature in the middle of the States.
Between Kansas City (stan Missouri) and Omaha (state of Nebraska) and between St. Louis (stand of Missouri) and Des Moines (stand of Iowa) the difference is almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, the annual temperature may rise again.
In most parts of the Mediterranean and eastern United States, temperatures are expected to rise at the beginning of October. The temperature should rise from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius to the south of the Great Lakes along the North East.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach a value of 27 degrees Celsius, or about 5 degrees above the limit.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of the presence of excessive temperatures on the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Britta Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people were watching television stations that broadcast a four-day hearing of candidates at the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, women accused of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the continuing political impact of the fifth commentaries, the programme has to be stopped regularly in order to inform the immediate return: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, under which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation on charges.
Christine Blasey Ford announced before the Senate court that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh had abused her in a state of innocence and tried to avoid her arrest during a class party.
In his emotional report, Kavanaugh said, however, he was convinced that such a situation had no place.
It is possible that the fifth number of televisions was even greater than that provided by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company calculated the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, no figures were available yet.
In addition, Nielsen is often having difficulties with the degree of visibility among people at work.
The number indicated is closer to the visibility of the American football game or the award of the American Film Academy.
According to the Nielsen Station Fox News Channel, which representatives were standing up to Kavanaugh's nomination, she had the highest visibility. It had an average of 5.69 million views during the final hearing.
In the second place, the ABC station of 3.26 million views was located.
CBS had 3.1 million views, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The issue remained high after the end of the hearing.
Jeff Flake became the key to five events.
In the mornings, CNN and CBS were recruited by the CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this murdered Republican announced that he had decided to oppose the nomination of Kavanaugh.
Flake, with his head down for a few minutes, listened to unexpected opinions. The whole event was transmitted by CNN.
"I stand here before you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the national truth?
You've got so many women in the face of poverty," he heard from a demonstration woman.
Before closing the windy door Jeff Flake said his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during the hearing of the Commission.
In later times, television stations continued to transmit events waiting to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh before the entire Senate.
Flake said he'd only be nominated if he knew that the FBI was investigating the charges in the coming week, which the minority of the Democrats were required to do.
Flake was convinced by the part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Cosen of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting with Chris Cossen and several other senators.
Flake's choice was important because the Republic would not have the votes necessary to approve the appointment of Britta Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump initiated the FBI's proceedings on charges raised by Bretta Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses the use of Brexit for its own benefits
The Sunday Times Prime Minister Theresa May reported on his plan to leave the European Union on the threshold of the future of Great Britain and to consider national interests.
The President Theresa May will attend the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, 29 September 2018.
In addition to the statement presented by Theresa May on the title page, foreign ministers in her government, Boris Johnson, attacked the future relations with the European Union in the aftermath of Brexit, which the Great Britain and the EU could adopt in its name, calling it "inexhaustible".
Wyde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of murder of the LSU attorney
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the death shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old boxer at the University of Stan Luisjana (LSU).
According to police commanders in Baton Rouge, the twenty-first-year-old Diton Simpson was arrested and arrested under the death penalty of the second stage.
The authorities published a recording from the confrontation between Simm and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost his eye.
As a link to the CBS station WAFB, police officers found the above-mentioned glasses on the site and found them following Simpson's DNA.
After Simpson's hearing, the police informed him he agreed to shoot Wayde.
As a prisoner handed over, a fine of 350 thousand dollars was fixed.
On the fifth floor of the East Baton Rouge Coroner's office, a preliminary report was issued, stating that the cause of death was the trauma of the head and tail.
The police committee thanked the search team of the state police in Louisiana, the state police lab, the Southern University police and the local residents for their assistance in the investigation of arrests.
Joe Alleva, director of the LSU sport, thanked the local authorities for "work and duty to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 198 cm man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father, Wayne Sims, also played in a box in the LSU.
In his last session, he recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 collections at the game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade said that the team was "damaged" and "damaged" by Wayde's death.
"It's one of the things we're still afraid of," said Will Wade.
Poultry issued by Mexico City’s Wall Street
Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for the Prevention of Live Crescents advised the inhabitants of Mexico to get closer to the volcano due to increased activity in crater and 183 cases of gas and fuel emissions over 24 hours.
The centre had a number of cuts and cuts.
Publicized in social media photos show car speeds covered by a low-performance fuel tank in parts of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Since the earthquake of 7.1 magnitude, which visited Mexico in September 2017, geophysics have noted the increase in the 72 km volcano activity in the southeastern part of the country.
The Grand Duchess, also known as Don Goyo, has remained active since 1994.
Police officers with catalytic separatists prior to the referendum on independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six persons were arrested as a result of the age of demonstrations supporting the independence of Catalonia with the preventive police departments. On that day, thousands of people participated in demonstrations that commemorated the first anniversary of the upcoming referendum on Catalonia's session.
A group of masked separatists rejected the eggs and the color of the police officers, and the dark clouds of dust made the streets usually full of tourists.
It was also achieved in the late part of the day, and the police were using the pillar to stop the fighting.
For a few hours, groups who supported their independence complained, "We don't forget, we don't forgive." The opponents of the sessions called, "They're living in Spain".
As a local pig, forty people received medical assistance in relation to minor injuries related to protests.
As a result of the year since the referendum of 1 October, the pressure is not weak. Although the authorities in Madrid recognized it as illegal, there is still reason to celebrate the desired Catholic session.
The voter in the overwhelming majority said that there was a lack of independence, but the frequency was low due to a wide-ranging fight against opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost a thousand people have experienced abuses in the past year in brutal age with the police trying to prevent the vote in electoral sites.
On Friday evening, groups of people supporting the region's independence decided to prevent demonstrations of police support.
Despite this, the demonstration was forced to change the track.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician who shared with his wife in a separatist protest, said there is no hope for the independence of Catalonia.
“In the past year we have lived one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried out with joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck in the spot without going out," he said.
Despite the considerable success of the local elections in the autumn of the last year, the parties supporting the Catalan session have difficulty in continuing their activities. Many of the most well-known leaders have decided to go out or wait for arrest in connection with the role played in the referendum and the subsequent announcement of independence.
Joan Puig, a four hundred-year-old protesting machine supporting the police, said that politics on both sides of the conflict is causing conflict.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been arrested since the end of last year, announced his wish to start in future elections to the European Parliament.
"Candidacy in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to help the crisis of the democratic value of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested following a multiple car attack in Londonderry.
The event occurred in the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 in British time (BST).

Bramka Mengi ensures the winning Livingston over Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Mengi for Livingston brought the team victory
From this season in the extra-class Livingston Club, he made the Rangers in isolation, placing Steven Gerrard's second piece in his 18 matches at the station of the Ibrox Park club trainer.
The Dolly Mengi branch won, and Gary Holt's team moved to the second place in the table with Hibernia.
Gerrarda's lead company will remain in this session without success on the exit of Premiership. The next week, he will meet the leader of Hearts, who will lose eight points.
Earlier, because already on Thursday, Rangers will visit the Rapid Vienna team in the game of the European UEFA League.
Livingston has extended a series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt did not notice any mistakes from moving to a position in the last month of Kenny Miller.
Livingston has missed several occasions against undisputed opponents.
The team led by Holta should have been involved much earlier, since the team game supported Rangoonsov with a lot of problems.
First, Scott Robinson crossed the defense and threw a bullet into the light of the arm, but he couldn't shoot naked, and then Alan Lithgov didn't find himself after crossing Craig Halketta's head.
The economics allowed Rangers to play closer to the branches, knowing that they can threaten the river during the constant fragments of the game.
And that's the way it's going to fall.
After the release by the Rangers of the Free Livingston group, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Mendze, who had gained a bullet from the middle of the prison.
At this stage, Rangers had more possessions, but they could not strengthen the defenses of the owners and did not make more problems for Liam Kelly.
This scheme was repeated in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos gave one shot on Kelly's shoulder.
Scott Pittman's test was chosen by the Rangers' Ramper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was unable to find a frame light from the next permanent fragment of Livingston.
The Rangers continued to attack in Livingston's military field, but they could not use the situation. Two reds were agreed upon after Halketta intervention against the change of Glenna Middleton and one edge of his hand. However, in both cases, the claim of advocates was rejected.
"Fenominal" expression Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
He thought they played a great game once and for all, running away from waiting.
Their style and composition have almost not changed since they returned to extra class. However, Holt should be valued for moving the team to play.
That sword had a lot of fortunes.
Captain Craig Halket played a great role, leading a well-organized defense, but Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very serious.
The rank of a man who wants to fight.
Although under the leadership of Gerrard, they have had wonderful moments, but they have not maintained their standards.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once was the defense of the owners. It should be a serious warning for the Rangers who were on the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Colonia
During the Saturday morning in Berlin (September 29th) the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied the funny and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of the building contest of President Erdogan's visit to Germany. The visits aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Conflicts have led to differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of movement and the accession of Turkey to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Colonia, where he opened a new, big game.
In this town, the largest number of Turks are outside their father's home.
However, the president's officers gathered around to see their leader for safety reasons.
A set of Erdogan opponents, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion by suffocating Turkey's leaders' policy and the German government's decision to adopt politics in the country.
Protests against themselves reflect the divisions that led to the visit of a rich man-made politician by some of the Turks who live in Germany and who are known for their self-recognition by others.

Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia. Number of victims growing
As the government gave it, at least 384 people died – many of which had been hit by the high waves of the beach – following a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palau, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the event of a festival in the city. On the beach, they hit a wall of even 6 meters high, calling for many people and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami was the result of a 7.5 degree earthquake.
"When the threat occurred yesterday, the people on the beach did not immediately flee and the victims of tsunamis," he said at the conference at Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the Indonesian Food Agency's spokesman for the BNPD.

On Saturday, the agency met with a general criticism of the lack of information on the impact of tsunamis in Palu. The authorities pointed out, however, that the plague had already occurred after the warning was issued.
On the amateur recording available in social media, you can see a man running from the building, trying to warn about the coming tsunamis of the people on the streets.
Within a few minutes, the water wall broke off the coast, putting up buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was not able to confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused significant shortages in the supply of electricity, making it impossible to communicate in Paul’s territory. This has also made it difficult for the government to coordinate military activities.

According to Indonesia's right to receive funding, resources and staff from abroad, it can be started only after the disaster site has been announced in the national climate.
I can't do that.
"We are officially still dealing with the disaster of regional employment," said the Indonesian Red Cross speaker.
"When the government realizes that it has reached national level, we will be able to start taking international assistance, but it has not happened yet."

Kanye West: rapper changes its name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Declaring his goal in Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: “A person known before as Kanye West. ”
Four thousand-year-old music has already used the pseudonym Ye. It is also titled his eighth album published in June.
The change occurred before a visit to the Saturday Night Live program. It is expected that the artist will present his new album, pt. Yandhi.
He will be replaced by singer Arian Grande, who, according to the authors, refused to participate “for emotional reasons. ”
West has previously stated that the word “Ye” is not only short from its present artistic heritage, but it has religious significance.
"It seems to me that 'yes' is the most frequently used word in the Bible. In the Holy Scriptures, it means 'You'," said West in earlier years, referring to the album with a radio presentation about Big Boy's pseudonym.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
First of all, I was Kane, which means one person. Now I am Ye – reflecting all our good, bad and bad characters.
The album shows us who we are."
West was in the game of other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Didy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.

President of Mexico's election Andrés Manuel López Obrador is committed not to use the army against civilians
In the early 50th anniversary of the bloodbath of the students' demonstration, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) made a commitment never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday at the site of the Third Culture López Obrador, he promised “never to use the military for the repression of the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers opened fires in the direction of the peaceful demonstration, killing even 300 people. The incident occurred when the left-wing students began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico, providing commensurate financial assistance to those who are learning, as well as creating more free public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities for young people with criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding of research on artificial intelligence
As Kai-Fu Lee says, an investor and artist of artistic intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, together with the increase in China's activity in this area of the United States, should double the costs of research in the SI field.
This has been noted in connection with declarations of artistic intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, although the United States does not have an official SI strategy.
In the past year, China has presented its plan to be the most innovative state in the field of artistic intelligence by 2030.
"In the beginning, we have to double the budget for the study on SI: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to achieve a further transition in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In the report made this week, the CNBC also said that double funding could increase the chances of further transition in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month's edition of Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, which is the company's company Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of China's most important companies with artistic intelligence, known as Face+.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University on the creation of the SI system, which was the best time for an American player in Othello game. He then took the lead position in Microsoft Research and was the president of the Chinese company of Google.
Lee recognized the success of the previous technological initiatives of the American government, such as organized by the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the Defence Area (DARPA) in competition for the most exciting job projects. He also returned with a question of the deadline for further editing of the gains, as it will help to find future audiences.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that takes us the best representatives of the academic environment, but corporations," Lee said.
For a few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired skilled scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
"I think that people who are engaged in artistic intelligence who have obtained a doctor's degree should be given a green card automatically," he said.
In July 2017, the Council of China published a plan for the creation of the next generation's artistic intelligence.
As noted by Lee, China's National Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of the academic institutions in a way that is closer to the American National Foundation for Science and other government organizations providing American sciences. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
In earlier this year, the Department of Defence of the United States called the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will be involved in the work of the partners from the world industry and science. The White House announced the establishment of a Special Scientific Intelligence Commission (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
In this month, DARPA also informed the DARPA of a 2 billion USD initiative called AI Next.
The National Foundation of Science currently invests more than 100 billion USD per year in the study on SI.
At the same time, the American initiative aimed at creating the National Commission for the Safety of Arts has not taken steps to the future.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in the referendum on the change in the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow for a period of several decades with Greece, which is blocking the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, on the territory of the historical territory of Macedonia, maintains that the name of the North-West Neighbor is growing in its territory, and this has led to the accession of the EU and NATO.
In June both governments reached agreement on the title, however, the Nazis claim that the change would reflect the ethnicity of the Slovenian majority living in Macedonia.
President Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging the boycott raised doubts as to whether the frequency would reach a minimum level of 50% required to recognize the referendum as binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Are you supporting NATO and the EU's accession following the adoption of a agreement with Greece?"
The candidates for a change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, claim that it is worth paying for the possibility of joining Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted in favour of my country's future so that young Macedonians could live freely under the European Union's umbrella. EU membership will provide us with greater security," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that it will reduce the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two third Members of Parliament.
The electoral committee informed the electoral committee that no adverse events had occurred by 13 hours.
However, the frequency of this hour was rather 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016.
"I voted in favour of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanewski, an election from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko gave a vote in the referendum on a change in the name of the country to open the way to NATO and the European Union.
Before the building of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set up a cross-section for the purposes of the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU's membership, but we want to join these organisations with the Union's head, not the back door," Kawardark said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of the Euro-Agency Integration."
Prime Minister Zaew states that NATO membership will provide the necessary investments in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will mention a change in the name in the referendum because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after voting.
He said that the vote on "that" would be "the confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute, from 30 to 43% of voters indicated that they wanted to participate in the referendum, which is less than the required frequency.
According to another Macedonian television television poll in the Sunday referendum, 57% of respondents are planning to vote.
70% of the respondents said they'd change their names.
To end the vote, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The breach in the referendum would be the first serious silence in the policy of the Western Government since the fall of power in May last year.

Scherzer wants to sign a chance to win Rockies.
After losing the chance to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer he did not have to appear in the first collection.
However, it is desirable to have Scherzer's rivivalization at a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies, if only Rockies hold the chance to appear in the play-off phase. Currently the team has one more victory than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West district.

Wiec Trumpa in West Virginia
The trumpet did not simply refer to its appointment by Bretta Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of Justice, discussing the importance of the frequency of Republicans in half of the presidential elections.
“In November, we will put all the time-consuming achievements in place.
From one of the most important choices in our life, we are divided into five weeks.
Although I'm not starting, I'm still very active. I'm a permanent weapon of our wonderful candidates," he said.
He then continued: “We are dealing with a huge group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions in our own eyes.
They are determined to collect power by any means possible, they are corrupt and corrupt.
They don't care who's hurt and who's got to hurt to gain power and control.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission “to build up and strengthen activities”.
"It was very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "bad, bad, bad and unfair."
The President referred to the Senate Commission for Justice, calling on the names and names of the American Senator from the Democratic Party of Diane Feinstein, who met with a loud beating on the part of the team.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for withdrawing the document?
"Uh, I hear?
No... that means... no. Her body was fatal, it was the worst body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The Party is neutral against persons expressing its own opinion
When the Momentum organisations in my party voted in favour of me, I wasn't disappointed.
At the end of the day, I am a member of the Working Party's mission group, which has recently been told that they are not well seen, and all of this is due to their own opinions.
My colleague Joan Ryan met with a similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the proposal for an appointment was made out of a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As in the irony of freedom, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In a fifth press release on the meeting of parliamentarians of the Nottingham East, we could read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years, I have had the work of the Ambassador of the Working Party most of the afternoon five meetings of the General Committee, which seemed just like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are taking place differently. Dawno has been forgotten about the promises of a "more tenderer and easier" policy, as ever as soon as it has been remembered.
More and more clearly, the Labour Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed under the terms of the party's leadership.
It all started soon after the position of President Jeremy Corbina, and colleagues, who seemed to me to have similar views, began to expect me to change my direction and take the position that I would not have agreed with before. They dealt with issues such as national security or the EU market unity.
After every public presence, regardless of the content, I meet in social media with attacks calling for nominations, strengthening the centre or leaving the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the views under my address are more political.
I welcome the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience daily sexual or racist treatment, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disturbing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with respect to others.
Last week Jeremy Corbin said the Party should support the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every proposal on "the source of uncertainty" and every change in the principle of choosing the world view of the party is bound to be.
Over the last two years, I have been repeatedly advised not to give up and go through some issues.
That's not why I was involved in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a result of the wishes of the Government of Margaret Thatcher, which led to the breakup of my school class, I am trying to look for a better quality of public services for those in need – both local and Ministerial.
I've never hidden my beliefs, as well as during the last election campaign.
Everyone in the Nottingham East knew my position and knew about the differences of opinions with the party's authorities.
I would like to say to those who have made a fifth request that I do not understand the desire to limit time and energy on my loyalty to the president of the labs in the vicinity of Brexit, which affects the domestic economy, business and public service.
However, the most important transmission is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (both members of the Labour Party and the rest): I am proud that I can serve you. I promise that no threat of denouncing nominations or imminent political goals will not prevent me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interest of all.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17 – Unfathomable Ayr again up
However, the two later additions may have failed at some point. However, there is no doubt that Ayr's team has earned the victory in this extremely interesting game of Scottish extraliability.
The group was first found in the table, and there is only one unsatisfied team.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and a better use of the opportunity led to a team of masters to win. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his fellows.
"The game was a challenge for us, but we're still not sure, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “We have to thank the Ayr employees, and they used the opportunity to show us better. ”
Ayr went on to run in 14 minutes after Grant Anderson's arrival and the rise of Frazier Climate. However, a yellow card for Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to balance the result when Jason Baggot took the ball after an unused chance to raise it.
The climate increased the conduct of Air after the fall of the war machine just before the end of the first half. First, he got the attachment, and later he used the chance to raise it, getting a score of 17:5 for Air.
Melrose started a second half well, and Patrick Anderson's submission, raised by Baggota, reduced the loss to five points.
Next came the long stop of the game due to the serious concussion of Ruaridha Knotta. The driver was removed from the bottle on his noses. After Ayr's renewal, he increased his driving after Stafford McDowalla and airlifting.
In the further fulfilment of the duties of Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson, he received a yellow card. Melrose again used its number: the attachment with the unusable attempt to raise Bruce Colvina reduced the conduct.
The economists took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for air conditioning without a ball. MacPherson got his attachment to the nearby streets.
The climate used the chance to raise the chance, and then he was able to raise the result right after the game was renewed, when Kyle Rowe caught a gun from the military wheel and enabled Grigore Henry to win a fifth prize for the owners.
Still Game series star starts a career in the gastronomic industry
Ford Kieran, the Still Game series star, seems to be starting to work in the gastronomic industry. It has recently been discovered that he has been the director of a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor took the role of Jack Jarvisi in a popular BBC station. He also presents the series together with his many-year-old comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the next nine seasons will be the last in the series history. All indicates that Ford Kiernan is planning the future after leaving Craiglang.
According to the official data, he was the director of the Adymorn Limited company.
The actor rejected the comment on this, even though the computer Scotty Sun suggested that Kiernan try to engage in a "increasing gastronomic industry" in Glasgov.
"The sea belongs to us": denied access to the sea of Bolivia, hope that the court will again open its way to the Pacific
The Marines patrol around the La Paz Marine Base.
The public buildings tell us the wrong flags.
In the ports of the Titanic warship, the following motto appears: “The sea is under our law.
His recovery is our duty."
In the absence of access to the Bolivian sea, the mention of the coastal line lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes may be greater than a few hundred years. Bolivia hopes for the International Court of Justice. It will be issued on 1 October following the five years of the process.
"Bolivia's actions make sense. Residents are single-minded, optimistic and number-on-the-art" said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will be together to observe the meeting of the International Court of Justice. They hope that the organization with its seat in the Hague will recognise Bolivia's growth and, after decades of safe negotiations, Chile will have to participate in negotiations on the granting of an independent state of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who will be in the wake of the upcoming debate on re-election, also puts hope in the Monday resolution.
"We're very close back to Pacific," he insisted at the end of August.
However, some analysts claim that Bolivia's chances of benefiting are small and that even an acceptable decision would not change much.
The Organization of the United Nations with its seat in Hadde has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also warned that it would not affect any dialogue.
As Paz Zárate said, Chilean expert on international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice was issued six months after the final arguments were presented.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to leave the country for the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolivian administration," Paz Zárate said.
The inexhaustible retort of Morales has left the Chileans any other good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will be talking again at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of an emergency.
In the case of both countries since 1962, it has not been possible to exchange Ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, the president and representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not agree with the opinion that the decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era with regard to relations with Chile" and the possibility "the end of the 139-year period of disputes concerning mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also refused, like Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, to use sea access as a political element.
"Bolivia never refuses access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is a great opportunity to convince ourselves that we must deal with the past."
North Korean authorities claim that nuclear disarmament will not occur until they can trust the United States.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never forget nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He invited the United States to keep the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be on the cover of the renewal of the suspended nuclear diplomacy over three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Unem.
Ri claims that the "murder" is like the lack of sanctions and the United States against the declaration of the final Korean war ever dropped North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without prior adoption by Pjongjang of concrete disarmament measures.
Both Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump want another meeting.
There is, however, a general assumption that Pjongjang is seriously undermining the arsenal, which is maintained in North Korea as the only means of guaranteeing security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trup.
The Paris fashion shows increases the newest line of large to cover heads in the clothing pockets.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or totally sleep in front of the sun, we have good information for you.
The designers of the Valentino and Thom Browne fashions presented a number of stolen, superiors to cover their heads that came into their collection earlier in 2019, which broke the style during the week of the Paris Fashion Week fashion.
It was not uncommon for non-practicable capelus to be added to the Instagram this year. The mentioned projectors decided to present their sculpting creatures on the run.
The different part of Valentino was a wide, wide-eyed white cape of a large, multicolored round with a head of the model.
Other ultrasound accessories included arbuses made of lacquered, capillary cape, and even annas — however, they were not designed to warm the head.
Tom Browne also showed a number of personal masks — at the same time at Halloween.
Many color masks had a mouth cover and remembered Hannibal Lecter style more than a skin texture.
One creature remembered the equipment to navigate with the wheel and the eyebrows, and the other looked like broken ice.
And if you don't want to get out of the way, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that large capeluses can be found in the leaves of the tree.
The countless capillaries are already carrying “La Bomba,” a silver hat with a width of 61 cm, which has already been worn by all — from Rihanny to Emily Rattakowski.
The cultural market, which was an unusually ineffective capelus, which was passed through social media, presented another major creation — a flat plastic bag almost as large as the model of the mirror.
The undergarments of the raffle, finished with raffic frescoes and cut off with a white cut hand, appeared in the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera in the season 2019 during the week of the Paris Fashion Week.

John Edward: Language Skills Needed for People of the World · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland will continue to enjoy their scientific achievements — in 2018 they could be praised for further significant results of exams, individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other social enterprises.
The Schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which includes over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are responsible for providing the best level of services for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education chosen by them for career careers and to show them their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that has the potential to develop and implement a school-based learning programme, we see that the languages of the schools are still popular and desirable.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another person in a language that he understands, then he is going to treat it to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it's in his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last review this year show that languages take the first place in legal rankings, with the highest performance indicators in the case of independent schools.
Together, 68 percent of students who learned urban languages received higher A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received higher A in Mandarin, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support citizens’ languages as necessary skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Language science, such as selection subjects, is currently being conducted in the same area as STEM's (study, technology, engineering and mathematics) education programmes in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that because of the difficulties in terms of job creation, 17 per cent of workers were responding to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are needed to enable young people to start a career.
These skills are necessary in a globalised world with growing numbers of jobs requiring language skills,
The skills that remain throughout life, such as learning a new language, will provide a great deal of insight into the future — regardless of the barrier to professional development.
The possibility of direct agreement with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of multilinguals in relation to competition.
According to the 2013 YouGov poll, in which more than 4,000 adults in Britain participated, 75% of them did not speak their native language in such a good way, and the French language was the only language in which the percentage of people serving was bilingual, i.e. 15%.
That is why investment in urban learning is also so important for children today.
The knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of the developing economies, will give children more opportunity to find appropriate employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to its language.
Many schools focus on more classical innovative languages, while others will learn the languages that are most important to the Great Britain in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interests, there will always be many languages in schools that will be taught by specialized educational staff in this area.
Good schools are involved in the development of a teaching environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to bring success — regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, business languages remain key to the future of the country, and that must be reflected in education.
New languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Schools that are independent will continue to offer a good choice, variety, and level of young people.
That's just right.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Debout LeBron in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans who wanted to see the Debute LeBron James in Los Angeles Lakers were finally waiting.
Luke Walton, Lakers' trainer, announced that LeBron James was playing in a week's pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one, but less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers' online company.
Lakers' team reporter Mike Trudell on Twitter reported that James's most likely playing a few minutes.
After training, which took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six consecutive Lakers games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in the pre-session games to prepare," he said.
More to choose Trupa in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight at Wheeling in the West Virginia election season.
It's the first five of the five planned by the electoral club that will take place next week, along with its presence in its friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote confirming the suspension of his election to a stand-alone position in the Court of Justice, the Supreme Court is committed to the construction of support in the nearby elections in the northern part of the government, as the Republican can risk losing control over the Congress when the votes are given in November.
What time will it take tonight to pick Trupa in the West Virginia, and where will it be seen on the Internet?
More to choose Trompa in Wheeling in West Virginia will take place today at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
More Trip choices in the West Virginia will be possible to track live via the Internet on YouTube service.
The trumpet is likely to be discussed on this year's hearings of a candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with the arrests relating to sexual misconduct, as well as the proposed vote in the Senate on the suspension of the election for a maximum period of one week, during the investigation by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of elections is to provide support to the Republicans in the face of difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trumpa's five-year-old campaign aims to "mobilising volunteers and volunteers to help the Republican to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the Election of Representatives" — Reuters.
"The Congress's control is so important in the president's harmonography that as the worst season of the campaign, it will visit as the largest number of states," said the spokesman of the Trump campaign, who did not agree to give his name — Reuters.
Today's elections in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract volunteers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump visits Virginia West — a city where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — twice in the last month.
The Tempp is trying to help the candidate Virginia West to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is missing in the probes.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to challenge him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, politician of West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States Society shows the spirit of the fight, holding hope for victory in Sundays
After three single sessions, the forum format that took place on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The collapsing wheel is a totally imaginary sports concept, but it's the kind in which employers really believe, and it's the most important thing in the professions like this.
So how do they look at their divorce right now?
"They've examined six points, and now they're running only four, so I think we have a little break," Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, takes four points, while there are still twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in their wings and have good examples to follow, especially as Spietha and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each could be praised for having three points from four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and sets an example.
The screams on the whole wall as a sign of subsidisation were becoming more and more loud during the course of his round, putting down the key pout and playing the game when he and Thomas got two fingers in two shots.
His return to the land that gave them success 15 met a similar challenge — one that explains that the American team is still in play.
"It's enough to gather and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all that's left for each of those employees.
18 feet to win.
The only players who in the last two days won more points than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable history of Ryder Cup.
Surprisingly, but she won four of the four European teams and didn't think.
"Molywood" is the only couple who didn't pay the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back them on Friday morning.
The way they play and how their energy seems to flow to and from the funny crowd shows that they should be done on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could contribute to the potential success of the European team on Le Golf National.
It would be best to play at the same time on different columns.
However, it is too early to talk about winning the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio García, the early fourball hero, when he was shot by Alex Noren.
Bogies and two-fold doublings on the front of them dug Spain and Sweden into a wall they would never get rid of.
There's no one on Sunday who could help get out of the hole.
Fourball and Foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between the parliaments, the councils that do not, the councils that do not do, and how at the same time can change the strategy.
Europe has been playing better as a team in the last day, but the Foursome session has also shown that the U.S. Army has a tendency to fight, in which some, especially in the United States, have doubts.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant transition on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday football matches and foursomes with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — has left a mark on two victories over the fighter Tiger Woods, increasing its recent results on Le Golf National to four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorna, trying to preserve the trophies that he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, reminiscent of an American group in the morning for the exercise of a series of 3-1.
The United States has put greater opposition in the format of the forums, playing two games, but they have not been able to save the loss.
To maintain a trophim, Jim Furyk's team has to get eight points from 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debiter who received four points from row, while along with Molinari (the group was called Molliwood after Sensing Week) are just the second pair in the history of Ryder Cup, which received four points in four opening games.
After the collapse of Woods and Patrick Reed in the furball style of the famous Woods and American Dechambeau debitant, it is even more sensitive to 57-4.
Woods, who moved through two Saturdays, occasionally showed a pass of genius, but this time he lost 19 out of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, and that's seven out of a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning exercise, returned to Henrik Stanson in the exercise form to complete the performance of 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepkė — taking part in the world’s launch, according to paragraphs 1 and 3.
However, the European team did not think it was a pleasant cold day on the south west coast of Paris.
Three-fold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They gained a decisive victory with the result of 2&1 on Hispane John Rahm and Jan Poulter in the form of a fourball and returned later to defeat Poultera and Rory McIlroy with the result 4&3 in the form of a foursome, covering two opening points.
Only two times in the history of Ryder Cup did it happen that the company would recover a four-point loss, starting single, although Fury's team would only have enough remiss to keep the trophies.
However, two days before the second place, the weekly contract seems to be less likely.
North Korea says "stop" to one-sided dispersion without confidence.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during the UN discussion that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence in North Korea in the United States and has no say that the country has a unilateral withdrawal from nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures of good will” last year, such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, detonating nuclear testing sites and commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see any specific response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and in such circumstances there will be no mention of the unilateral deployment of North Korea."
While Ri repeated the known North Korean claims on the lack of Washington's “progressive” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual action, its statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had place in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Una and Donalda Trumpa in the first instance in the history of the dispute between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader, who took place on 12 June in Singapore when Kim Jong Un committed himself to the work of the South Korean People's Republic of Korea, and the Tempp promised security assurances of North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (in 1950–53), but the United States representative announced that Pjongjang must first withdraw from nuclear weapons.
Washington also relied on calls for the reduction of the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization in the first sequence" and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its objective in a taxable manner, even contrary to the signing of the "war ending declaration", Ri said.
"The testimony that sanctions can cast us on the knees is the hatred of people who behave in a way that ignores us.
The problem is, however, that the lack of sanctions deepens our uncertainty."
Ri did not mention plans for the second prize between Kim Jong Unem and Donald Trumpe, who spoke about the beginning of the week of U.S. leadership at the United States Forum.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Unem and South Korean leader Moon Jae-inem over the last five months, adding: "If South Korea was a party to denuclearization, rather than the United States, it would not have had such an impact on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula".
Despite this, the tone of the Ri speech was completely different from the previous year when it said during the UN General Assembly that the removal of North Korea rockets in the United States territory is undisputed after the "Mr. Evil President" Trump (Pan ill President Trump) named Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (man) on the same mission.
In this year at the UN Forum Trump, which had threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year, Kim Jong Una praised his reaction to taking steps to combat, but also said that there was still a lot of work to be done, and he also said that until North Korea's nuclear weapons are stopped, the sanctions will not be destroyed.
In the middle of the trip, he said that he did not mean a part of the time, saying: “No matter whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it is no longer important. ”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council Forum: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued and not established until we find a complete, final and verified denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously suspended sanctions against North Korea, trying to alleviate the financing of the nuclear and ballistic missiles in Pungjang.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly Forum and later said that in the coming month he would visit Pjongjang again in preparation for the second visit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress had been made, and in a few hours, North Korea helped him to “put on Gangster’s demands”.
North Korea committed itself this month to meet Moon Jae-inn to decompose the place to test rockets and nuclear complex if the United States will take "adequate measures".
He said that Kim Jong Un told him that the "relevant measures" he belonged to are security guarantees to ensure that Trump was committed to Singapore and to take steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students participate in a course of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided more sleep for all students, which was aimed at combating the growing soft culture of learning by "full-time students with caffeine."
Academic students from the best university in the world often do not know the basics of the mind.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that according to him is the first type in the United States.
To create a course, he was inspired by a speech on the impact of sleep disorder on science.
"After the talk, one girl approached me and said, "Why do you tell me this right now when I'm in the last year of studies?"
She said that no one ever told her the meaning of my dream," The Telegraph said.
During the course that took place for the first time this year, it will explain to students how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, as well as improve the general feeling of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University of Health, said that this course was intended to be introduced after the students were found to suffer from severe sleep loss within a week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of the room in the Academy where students call the Philippines to coffee, texting, training and books to get information about the influence of coffee and light and how bad dreams affect sports results, as well as how important it is to maintain sleep regularity.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart failure, brain failure, depression and innovation.
The map of the campaign with interactive icons encourages participants to stand up to their daily routine.
"We know that this is not the immediate change in students' behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know what health effects are associated with paper burning," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of Duchy with "full-time science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students is increasingly a problem of sleeplessness.
A sufficient amount of sleep for good quality should be “a secret weapon” for students who fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even to avoid getting attention, because sleeplessness causes the brain to go through hunger, because the student is still hungry, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California biologist studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop a course after taking part in one of his studies last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the course for the entire campaign.
The next step is to invite all students to complete a similar study programme before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a reminder when to go to sleep and when to get up, as well as to be aware of the harmful influence of the "heavenly Light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lighting, which could break down the pace of time and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga provides Gerrarda team
The Rangers continued to suffer while fighting on their way to Livingston, when Dolly Menga took his shot to the ruins of Steven Gerrard's group, winning the score 1-0.
The company of Ibrox Stadium wanted to record its first victory from the famous triumph 4-1 over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won Gerrard a second time in 18 matches, leading his team to a difference of eight points about Leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot a bullet seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers team showing no involvement did not seem to have to be fixed.
While Rangers noticed a fall in the sixth place, Livingston jumped to the third — just for the Hibernian with the loss of a single hill.
The Rangers' company may have further difficulties with the need for the care of the head of the Caluma Spence court after he was treated by an item abandoned by the guest.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that allowed him to sell Ayr and move to half the Betfred Cup.
Holt left with the same uniform Livingston, who took the point of the Hearts team last week, being the most popular way his well-trained team was to beat every step of its opponents.
The Rangers may have made the possession of the arrows worse, but that's the Livingston team made more of the ball when they got it.
They should have gotten naked within two minutes when it was the first shot by Mengya that allowed Scott Pittman to move with Allan McGregor's arm, but the assistant didn't take advantage of his chances.
Keaghan Jacobs then sent a deep red to Captain Craig Halketta, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, who was playing in the defense position, could only remain in the position below.
Rangers took control of the third quadrant, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos must have thought that he belonged to a red team for fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless fell on himself, but Judge Steven Thomson had developed the collapse of Columbia.
The Rangers were able to deliver only two targets in the first half, but they were Ibrox, Liam Kelly, who suddenly worried about Lassany Coulibaly and I'd lose Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingston's 34-minute naked ball opening the game could be against the game's break, no one can deny that they earned him for the effort he had put in his possession.
Once again, Rangers didn't deal with the deep permanent fragment of the game that Jacobs performed.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher threw a ball into Scott Robinson, who kept him calm, giving Mengi a simple finish.
Gerrard didn't move in and changed Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and the change soon affected the crater who threw the ball into Morelos, but the pressureing Kelly managed to block her out of her position.
Livingston's company continued to attract guests to the game exactly the way they like it when Lithgov and Halkett performed long-term administrations of each other.
Holta's team could have increased driving in the last few minutes, but McGregor had a good time standing in front of Jacob, after which Lithgow left the game from his birthday.
The Rangers Reserves, Glenn Middleton, had another hope for the Red Army when he was dating Jacobs, but Thomson was reborn.
Almanac: Geiger Number Founder
And now the page from our issue “Sunday Morning” Germanac: 30 September 1882 – 136 years ago... the day John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger number.
Since then, Geiger's number has become both an element of science and pop culture, such as in the 1950's "Bells of Coronado" film, where you've had a very small chance of being able to do this.
The man says, "What's wrong with you?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s number used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you install these sensors, you will hear the effects of the action of the atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans says, "Now hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can learn how to "keep" the enemy of the cell.
A new cancer vaccine can learn how to "keep" the enemy of the cell and destroy it
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the enemies of the cell in the course of treatment.
This is the method of removing and modifying resistant cells from the patient's laboratory.
At the same time, they can "keep" a common white for many noveltys, then they are re-injected into the body.
The sample shows promising results in patients with different types of novelty.
In one woman treated with a vaccine, learning to recognize the enemy of the cell, a new egg was observed for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate the resistant cells from the patient, to change them into the laboratory so that they can "keep" a common protein for a number of HER2 novels and then re-inject the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute of Cancer in Maryland said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very good. ”
HER2 "progresses the growth of several types of novelty", including the novelty of cheese, eggs, milk and vegetables, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the collection of resistant cells from patients and their location of new cells has been involved in the treatment of some kind of protein.
Kanye West is on the pro-trompowsk diaries in the Saturday Night Live program, with MAGA on its head.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was "resurrected" in a study in the course of the Saturn Day Night Live program after the president of the United States Donald Trumpa said he would be asked about the administration in 2020.
After performing that night his third-party creation of Ghost Town, during which he had a written "Make America Great", he carried out a campaign against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people, and I hear you say, "How can you like Trumpa? It's racist!"
If I'd been a racist, I'd've been out of America for a long time," he said.
The SNL program began with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star posted a report of Bretta Kavanaugh before the senate commission on the rape charges on the sexual grounds introduced by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he wasn't transmitted, the West's recording was sent to social media by Chris Rock's comic.
We don't know if Rock wanted to laugh at West in the post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems with his hat.
“They took me for a ride.
They said I wouldn't get out of this hole on my head.
They're on me!
And then they say I don't have a way out," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Tell me I don’t have a way out?” adding: “I’m putting on a superman’s dress, so why can’t you tell me what to do? Do you want the world to go to the future?
Let's accept it."
His words were twice called "publication" and the members of the SNL team looked at the suspects — they brought the Variety. The person who was in the study during these events said, "The study contained a grave silence".
West was invited to the program as the successor of singer Ariany Grande, who was a boy, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was interested in the performance of the company I Love it in protecting Perrier's water bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "One of the most powerful: DIFFERENTS FOR MAFII'S SITES".
The director of the show, Karen Hunter on his Twitter site, said that West was just "he was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I won't reward people (by buying them music or weapons or by supporting them "study"), who, as I think, accepts and is widely harmful to my society ideology.
He's free.
That's how we're free," she added.
Before the raper program, he announced on Twitter that he changed his name and that he is now "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name – he is a follower of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friend of rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to symbol, and then an artist known as the Prince.
Insulting the slaughter of foot-and-mouth disease in the restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with committing murder after lying on his feet in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident was a place in Ballyhackmore, as the police were bringing.
The accused shall be held on Monday before the trial in Belfast.
The hostages will be tested by the prosecutor.
A star game on the throne Kit Harington moves the issue of toxicity
Kit Harington is known for its role as Jon Snow in the medium-term series of HBO "Tron Game".
The 31-year-old actor was hit by the stereotype of the soft, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys often to think they have to play hard to be respected.
Speaking of Sunday Times Culture, Kit claimed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxicity problem at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his partner in the game of the throne, 31-year-old actor Rose Leslie, admitted that he feels "very sure" to move this issue.
He said: “I personally feel quite sure at this moment, where did we make a mistake on the subject of humanity?"
"What have we taught men in their early years, looking at the perspective of the problem we are currently dealing with?"
Kit believes that the development of toxicity can be partly responsible for television because of the presence of very human beings.
He continued: “What sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion, awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah! ”
What does TV and the streets teach, making young boys start thinking that they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think it is one of the most important issues of our time — what can we do to change it?
Clearly, it's not all right with young men."
The report also noted that it is no longer playing in any prequeue or series of games after the end of the series in the following year, saying that it “has ended with the fields of battle and horses”.
From November Kit will play in the "True West" Sam Sheparda, a story about the film producer and his brother — the thief.
The actor recently showed that he considered his wife Rose to be the best thing that happened to him in the throne game.
"I met my wife on the plan, which gave me my future family and a new life," he said.
In this multiplicity prize, Emmy of Rose's series of fans played Ygritte — an object of warm interest in the role played by Kitai, Jona Snowa.
Para met in June 2018 on the territory of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China notes 14 percent increase in new cases
China announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the health services of the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of the new cases were decided by the gender path, meaning change in the past.
Traditional HIV virus spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected in this way was almost completely reduced, as the Chinese health services officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
The transfer of HIV to a sex route is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT society.
Homosexualism was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is widespread.
In view of the country’s conservative value, studies estimate that 70–90% of men who have sex with men will end up with a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient insurance during these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has provided general access to HIV medicines in the context of efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters objected to the fact that one of her team revealed the data to the senators of the Republican Party — “an dangerous lie” and“ a written theory”.
A member of the United States Election of representatives, Maxine Waters, refused a warrant on Saturday, as a member of her team placed personal data from three Republican senators on the websites of the lawmakers.
A member of the Party of Democrats from Los Angeles ensured that these charges were filed by experts and websites related to "ultra-related obstacles".
"Talk, lies and even more innocent lies," Waters reported on Twitter.
The information published included the same address and phone numbers of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was placed by an unknown person in the Capitol while listening to the panel at Senatia on sexual harassment against the Supreme Court, Bretto Kavanaugh.
The escape took some time after the Kavanaugh candidate was questioned by three senators.
Conservative pages, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was linked to the Waters Agency and published information about the Waters team’s members — as Hill gives.
"This is absolutely false and it's a stup-percent lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security have been violated as a result of these frauds and false accusations — was not in any way responsible for the disclosure of these information.
This unsubstantial fraud is completely false and is a stupendous lie."
Waters ’ speech quickly generated a criticism on the Internet, including by Ario Fleischera, a former Persian official of the White House.
"This way of resisting is bad," Fleischer wrote.
"It ensures that she does not have the appropriate temperature to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, it can't be bad.
He can't procrastinate.
He cannot question the motives of the person in charge.
That's why we have to keep peace."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats under the direction of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being over-explained during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate starting in the mid-term elections to replace the Waters station, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"A lot of things, if that's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said that her Gabinet informed “the proper authorities and authorities of the prosecutions. ”
"The judges will be demached and brought to legal responsibilities for all their actions that pose a threat to any of the members of my team," she said.
Review of Johnny English: Nokaut — Spanish parents with a weakened Rowan Atkinson
The search for references to Brexit in every new film with British poem has already become a standard. It seems to be applied in the case of a new part of the film series from the stock item and the "Johnny English" comet, which began in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and returned to the screen of kin in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the satirist himself about how desperate we are to become a new commodity in the exporting country?
In any event, amazed, characterising the rubber face, the non-compliant Johnny English has again obtained a license to participate — his name and name more than anything else indicates that he is an intelligent, comical creature designed for non-English views.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent, who, despite his amazing appearances to the smoothy glamour, has a detail from Inspector Clouseau, the spy Jasia Fasoli, and this guy's hat, adding one to the beat of the leading Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London in 2012.
In the past he was also a traveler and a world-secretary man — Atkinson had ever played in the forgotten TV ads Barclaycard, where he left behind chaos.
In the latest Johnny English series, one or two points are good.
I liked the scene in which Johnny English approached the helicopter, being armed with a medieval army, while he was hit by a viper's helm.
On the screen, you can clearly see Atkinson's gift to physically play a comedian, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially now that “strong” film brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedian elements as part of the film composition.
The humorous elements seem to be more hidden in children than adults — I think Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as mental and coherent as the gays in the German Atkinson movies about Jassa Fasoli.
From the very present point of view, the Great Britain has serious problems.
Cyberhaker moves to the British superfine spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents working in the area — when the agent threatened the service, Kevin Eldon, who had an unexpected role to play.
This is the last drop in the prime minister's wrath, which is a pupistic, demarcated state already and so painfully the result of the nerve loss caused by the lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power, moving into Theresy May's position, but the scenario does not give her a chance to develop a crack.
Her consultants from the intelligence agency inform her that she will have to return to the service of one of the deceased agents because of the identity of all active spies.
And this means that Johnny English is in his own person, now employed as a teacher in some elegant school, sharing in informal lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few minors during the course of English speaking.
English is called to Whitehall for rehabilitation, re-connecting with his former assistant, Bugh, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a married man who is in charge of a submarine — strong, but somewhat weakened by the role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin participate in His Royal City's secret service return to action, meeting a beautiful feminist Ophelia Bullet, to become played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is dangerously dominated by a charismatic billionaire-manac, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain – is the captain of Jason Volta, the game of Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are starting their cross-section from absurd situations: bans for kelners are under French restaurant; they introduce chaos, manufacturing on the luxurious corner of Volty's yacht; and English is breaking down while using a set of virtual reality to meet inside Volty's house.
In this last sequence, all restrictions disappear, but despite mild and easy execution, the whole film is very memorable for children.
A typical average.
Like other movies from Johnny English series, I couldn't resist thinking: Can't British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be responsible for his talent?
The Labour Party objects to the development of a plan which provides for the British four-week work week for which they receive compensation in five days
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering the introduction of a radio plan within which British workers will work four days a week, receiving a reward in five days.
The Party likewise wishes that the heads of the firm deliver to the rescue workers the revolution related to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an additional day-to-day.
This allows workers to enjoy the third week, getting the same amount of remuneration.
The sources suggest that this concept will be "written" in the economic programme of the party and the country's exit plans against workers.
The four-week work week was supported by the Conference on Trade Relations as a means of using staff to change the economy.
An elderly member of the Labour Party, speaking with The Sunday Times, said: “It is expected that before the end of this year a policy change will be announced.”
"This will not happen from day to day, but the fourth week of work is something that is part of the party's approach to restoring economic balance for the employee as well as in the general strategy of the industrial party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support this idea — the Green Party has committed itself to introduce a four-week work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
The Working Party spokesman said: “The weekly working week is not a party’s policy and its implementation is not considered by it.”
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Customs Office, used last year's conference of the Labour Party to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "expectors" in public utility companies.
The Canclerza plans of the branch also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not receive their full share, as the Government of the Labour Party could perform "response" on the basis of the discovery of damage.
It also endorsed the plans to place employees in company management and to set up an integrated property fund to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of its own private sector to those who receive annual dividends at a maximum of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer in the 60-minute program to the question whether the FBI's investigation about Kavanaugh can make them change their settings
The FBI's investigation of charges against the Court of Justice of Bretto Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised questions as to whether the establishment of the office could lead the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
The program will be held on Sunday, “60 minutes” by Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that could change their settings.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when he showed up, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was stable, determined and unique."
But Graham's opinion seems to be thrown into the truck.
"I have made a decision about Bretta Kavanaugh and to change it is necessary to stop it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it's: Brett's standing against it," Graham added, turning to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No person he gives could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's going to change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival, and at any rate has contributed to the reduction of poverty?
The next Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, the annual musical events that can be praised by the most impressive composition of the stars and also the impressive mission — the eradication of poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival visits tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the events of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important goal of the event, which is the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that is working on combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (though it was decided to purchase the VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mail to the world leader, telephone or other significant actions to help raise awareness of the goal of poverty eradication.
But what success can the Global Citizens have in the future of the remaining 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of reimbursing people with free concerts a good way to convince them to demand action, or another case called "cticticism", when people feel that they are doing something important by signing a petition on the Internet or by posting an entry on Twitter?
The Global Citizen Organisation claims that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been used to support action, leading to many different objectives.
It also claims that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and provisions of more than $37 billion, which have to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had reached 390 commitments and declarations resulting from its activities, with at least 10 billion dollars already paid or financed.
The group estimates that the security measures have recently directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British partnership of investors and contractors involved in "helping children to achieve their full potential", which promised to transfer Rwanda $35 million to assist in the eradication of malnutrition in that country, after members of the Global Citizens sent more than 4700 tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizen, such as You, we can make it possible that social injustice, which is a lack of experience, will go to history" — Tracey Ulllman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after the implementation of more than 5000 actions calling for Britain to improve the quality of mother and child feeding, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach up to 5 million women and children with food problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which were “How can you be sure that you will be able to eradicate extreme poverty?”,
“ It’s going to be a long and difficult road, ” the global reader replied. “ Sometimes we get tired and feel frustrated.
But like in the case of recent major civil rights movements and fighting apartheid, we will be able to succeed, as we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars that occur during the current event in New York, whose economies will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a military marinary to the Russian energy export blockade — Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, if necessary, flee to his military mariner to prevent the influence of Russian energy on the markets, as well as those in the Middle East, revealed by the Secretary of State of the Interior Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Markets maintained that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it acts at the request of the legitimate government — is a barrier to the exploration of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for which they are in the Middle East is that they want to focus on energy trade, as they have a place in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States on its military mariners have the opportunity to make sure that the coast of the sea remains open and, if necessary, to create blocks to ensure that their energy is not marketed," he said.
Markets spoke to participants of an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defined itself as a "vote of energy" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The option of the economy of Iran and Russia is less to use and replace fuel," he said, comparing Russia to "a single-study mouse" with the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These declarations appeared when the Trump administration continued its mission aimed at increasing the export of land-based gas to Europe — a much more expensive option for European consumers than Russian gas.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to clear themselves of the "inappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trupa, made Berlin a "new" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which has doubled the existing gap to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic one.
Kreml argues that the bitter opposition to Washington to the implementation of this project results only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure relief tool and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the Secretary of Energy of the United States of America Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States of America has expressed its negative reaction to Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The known German Industrial Organization, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to refrain from joining the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think this is a big problem when the third country is insinuating in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following a recent meeting of the German Chancellor Angeli Merkel with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said he's considering the president's application in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the medium-term election, he would consider the president's application.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidate.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and make a corrupt government. This is also true of women who are singing the highest position," she said, "The Hill.
"After 6 November, I shall consider my candidate for the President's position."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trumpie, saying that he "will lead the country into a bad direction".
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren, without a garden, expressed his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday, on Twitter, Warren wrote: “Of course we need the FBI's investigation before the vote.”
However, published on Thursday, the survey showed that most Warren voters do not think they should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who chose the option “probably” said that the senator should not apply as a result of a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent dropped the candidate.
The survey showed greater support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick — 38 per cent of those who supported his potential candidate, and 48 per cent opposed him.
Other well-known names from the democratic defence team in the context of the potential candidate in 2020 were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision on the basis of what Associated Press gave him.
Sarah Palin speaks of the PTSD group of Palina during the election year of Donald Trumpa
Track Palin (26 years) spent a year in Iraq after he was taken to the army in September.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, why he has to go back, I understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers return with," said the audience at the age of the election Donalda Trumpa in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son’s arrest “the subject of Tabu, ” after which she said of her son and other warriors:“They return a little, they return loaded, they return, wondering whether they would be grateful for what their fellow soldiers, planes and all the other members of the army had given their country. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilli on Alaska and charged with domestic violence against women, forced to file false reports on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of non-state, as Dan Bennett, the spokesman for the Department of Police of Wasill.
18 states and South Columbia support the struggle with a new asylum policy
Eighty states and South Columbia support a legal challenge for the new policy of the United States, which refuses to make an asylum for victims who run away from the gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 states and districts placed in Washington on Friday a letter of friendship to support the asylum seekers who are struggling with this policy — according to the NBC News.
The full name of the call for Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union has submitted in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his brutal son-in-law" were offended at her, but the U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The U.S. state prosecutors in favor of Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries struggling with widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new American asylum policy has slowed down the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants to seek asylum in front of domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Attorney-General of Colombia, said in a fifth statement that the new policy "has been in force for decades by state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle", as stated in the list of friends girl.
The prosecutors further argued in the list that the policy against the immigration of the United States economy was harmful, claiming that they could become businessmen and that they could “make the necessary labour force”.
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions in June ordered the immigration courts to stop the execution of the victim's asylum in front of domestic violence and that managed by the gang.
"Azil is available for those who leave their country because of racial, religious, national or political persecution or fear of racial, ethnic or ethnic origin or because of their involvement with a particular social group or with such political convictions," the session said in its statement on 11 June on asylum policy.
He never intended to solve all the problems — even those that are serious — with which people from all over the world struggle every day.
Desperation of sexual attempts in Paul in the situation where the number of victims of death has doubled in the race to which the aim is to find survivors
The situation is becoming more and more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling," said 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, experiencing her angry son in an evacation center in the city of Palu.
"With a minute the ambulance will bring the body.
He's missing clean water."
Residents were seen returning to destroyed houses searching for water and trying to save everything they could find.
In the early days, hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by earthquakes of 7.5 degrees, were quickly filled.
Some wounds, including Two Haris, who experienced damage to the spine and shoulder, were recovered outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to severe internal disturbances.
His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of a terrible earthquake that swept the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to fight.
I think I've been forced into the Romanian wall" – Haris said Associated Press, adding that his family came to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, after which her voice stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States accuses China of "indicting" propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-star advertisement in an American newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of the US-China trade, the United States ambassador in China accused Pekin of using an American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, in the crying environment, referred to China’s payroll at Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa — accusing China of attempting to interfere with the United States Congress, which will be held on 6 November — the Chinese oppose this charge.
As a result, Pekin tried to get into the U.S. elections, confirmed what the U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new stage in the campaign to expand the press in China by Washington.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercial advertising with their countries, Pekin and Washington are currently leading to a scale of trade which has led to the imposition of customs duties on imports.
Chinese trade tariffs had to touch exporters in such situations as Iowa, who supported the Republican Trupa Party — Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States of China and was the governor of the state of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Pekin was responsible for poor American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
In an article published in Des Moines Register, Branstad said that China “now with double force is beginning to tremble, placing propaganda in our own free market”.
"As a result of its propaganda, the Chinese government is benefiting from the so-called American tradition of freedom of speech and of free press, placing a free advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
For this reason, there will be no voices in the streets of Beijing and no real reflection of the varied views that Chinese may have on China's disturbing economic direction, bearing in mind that the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party" — he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what the newspaper said.
Republikas appear before middle-aged women with the right to vote by the Kavanaugh affair, warning analysts
While many civil republics support and defend the Supreme Court of the Britta Kavanaugh in the face of a few temptations to attack on sexual grounds, the analysis cautions that members meet during the coming mid-term elections with a negative reaction, especially on women.
The emotions accompanying this event are very large, and most Republicans already want to vote officially.
"This cannot be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, on Saturday.
Reeher said there is doubt as to whether the efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (Arisona) to conduct the latest investigation by the FBI are sufficient to calm all the voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday — they won't forget this morning and they won't forget it until November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior adviser and national spokesman of the movingOn group – as a newspaper published in Washington.
On Friday morning, the protestors filed a letter of "Hourdays of November", demonstrating in the Senate on the basis of the decision by the Republicans to control the Commission on the non-interference of the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the reports of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as did Mic.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going beyond the scale," said one of the information pages Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“People say that it was so high — and it’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among undecided women and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before the public opinion, Ford, in which she described in detail her comments on the sexual assault of a candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republic had decided to approve the candidate, this could have been a valid response.
"The Republican Party has to deal with a small refugee," Michael Steele said at the beginning of last week, the president of the Republican National Committee — according to the NBC News.
"Not only is it about the Commission's vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also about the way the Republic has dealt with this situation and how it has dealt with Ford," said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, a group that supports the democratic elections.
However, the Americans seem to be divided into something about who to believe in the news of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more support.
The new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents have either decided or more believed in Ford's reports, while 35 percent said that decision-making or rather believed in Kavanaugh's reports.
In addition, 38% of respondents found that Kavanaugh was probably lying or probably lying while making reports, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the release of the press by the Flake FBI, an investigation into the charges issued by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor who is Deborah Ramirez — as The Guardian.
Ford stated the last week before the Senate Commission that Kavanaugh was attacked by alcohol at age 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court has shown her genetics during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web network creator plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web network, runs a startup that is competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
Inrupt, a company based on the open-source platform, Solid, which belongs to Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to specific information.
The only exception to the Fast Company Berners-Lee stated that Inrupt's purpose is "dominating over the world".
"We have to do this now," he said, referring to the start.
"The historic moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "Internet with personal data" or other POD.
It can include contact lists, lists of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The only sign of the Internet with personal data is that the user is completely dependent on who has access to the information.
The company calls it "the personal capacity through data".
According to the president of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
At present, Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, a number of developers employed in the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology manufacturers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to make a total change that causes the return to the top of all their business models from day to day.
"I'm not asking them for permission."
On Saturday at the Berners-Lee Platform, he wrote that "the Inrupt mission is the supply of trade energy and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been very involved in the debate on network neutrality.
By allowing Inrupt Berners-Lee to live, he remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm particularly underprivileged, thinking of the next time in the development of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Spiritual Cross of Victoria during World War I · Global Voices
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which in the time of World War I was marked by the Victorian Cross, was learned 100 years later in his hometown.
The nobleman Bernard Vann was elected on September 29, 1918, to be born in Bellengles and Lehacourt.
He was killed by the shooter four days later, never found out he was marked by the highest British military order.
On Saturday his two grandsons sent stones to remember during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that sending a stone directly in the seventh anniversary of the birth of a grandfather was “extremely symbolic. ”
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the Vann Pluc led his battalion by the Canal of Saint-Quentin “in a very thick and strong shield from the police and machine weapons”.
He then rushed to the fire line and led it with the “greatest look” forward, after which he launched an attack on the position of three of them.
Ppolk Vann was killed by the German army on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years old) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that I would never have recommended, but rather humble. ”
Along with his brother, Dr. James Vanne, he filed a conviction after the end of the parade conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to be able to participate in the paradise" and added that "the two true rich people are going through the support they receive from many."
Fani MMA didn't sleep all night to look at Bellator 206's galley, and instead they got the Swinky Pepp.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to see the packed emotions of Bellator 206 and finally you can't see the main battle.
The program may have included 13 battles in San Jose, including six on the main map, and was shown to live at night in Great Britain on Channel 5.
On the 6th morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the war, the sights in Great Britain were shaken by a change in the program at Şwink Peppa.
Some were shocked after they didn't sleep in the early mornings, especially after seeing this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described a switch for children as “a sick joke. ”
"In accordance with the Government's regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate in order to allow it to be released at 6 a.m., as necessary, for the programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, the senior marketing and communication vice president of the Bellator organisation when asked about transmission.
"Winka Peppa, yes."
The president of Bellator's organization, Scott Cooker, said they're working on harmonographics to take into account future views from the Great Britain.
"When I think about the situation again, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it is on the sixth day, and we will not be able to fast until the seventh day, according to our time; and on the seventh day, according to their appointed time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we had a lot of comments that no one would have listened to.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical tool.
But it wasn't just a matter of law.
I can promise that this situation will no longer happen again.
We limit the program to five wars rather than six — that is, to the standard amount.
It's an uncomfortable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "bad" because of sex
Tom Daley, an Olympic jump in water, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but gave him the motivation to make it work.
24-year-old said he didn't think that all of them weren't like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program, Lauren Laverne said he was talking about the rights of gays to give another "hope".
He also said that being a parent made him less likely to win the Olympics.
The usual director of this broadcast for many years, Kirsty Young, took months of free health care.
In the program for the first time conducted by Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt “lower” than others, because “the love of boys and girls at the same time was not socially acceptable”.
He said: “To this day it is a feeling of low value, and being different is something that gives me the strength to be successful. ”
He said he wanted to prove it's "something worth" not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent member of the LGBT society and used its appearance at the current European Communities in Australia to appeal to a greater number of countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was determined to express himself because he felt happy, able to live an open life without any involvement, and thus wanted to give another “hope. ”
Three times the world's master said that his love for a man — the American filmist Dustinie Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — was “caught away. ”
Daley met Oscar's winner (who is 20 years old) last year, pointing out that such a difference of age was never a problem for him.
"When you went through so many young years," he thought his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father's death three years later, he said it was difficult for him to find someone in the same age who experienced similar injuries and accidents.
Para was born in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said he's completely changed his behavior.
"In the past year, it was the most important thing for me to get a gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? There are more important things than the gold medals of the Olympics.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had tickets to the Olympics in London in 2012 — he wanted to have a place in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You won't be with us to be in the first row, Dad'," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, but when he stopped breathing and died, I realized he wasn't upset," he said.
In the following year, Daley took part in the Olympic Games in 2012 and won a prize.
“I knew that this was what I have been dreaming about all my life – to jump to the water before the deep people on the Olympics – it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud in the performance of Heather Small — which accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and which continues to prepare him for the song.
The Desert Island Discs program is released at BBC Radio 4 station every week at 11:15 BST.
Displaying lack of Mickelson shape on the shoulder during the rest of the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set up a Sunday record when it breaks his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he will have to work on his form so that she doesn't print his fifth.
Mickelson, playing twice in the event of two years of the event, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of action, as was often the place in his case in the U.S. Army, the main winner had to spend the day on teaming and work on improving his game in order to improve the cause of his delivery.
48-year-old, who never delivered the most simple hits, even at the time of his career, does not necessarily check well on the Le Golf National field, where the wrong hits are permanently wounded by long-distance roughs.
And if the same field is not enough to disappear for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, he has to set up a key to win the British Open — Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with debitant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the American (with the loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) starts the game with a worm, the game Mickelson can become especially key.
Furyk expressed confidence in his employer — he could do nothing else.
"He fully understood his current role today, buried me behind his back, held my hand, and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's very sure of himself.
He's in the famous gallery, and he's put a lot of emphasis on his team games both in the past and in the week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought they'd be more, but that's what happened, and we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which never compared his individual achievement.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 shootings and seven remissions on his account, and Furyk said that his presence has contributed much to the team.
"It's fun, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny and it's good to have it in the group room," he explained.
"I think young players played well with him this week, which was nice to see.
He's got a lot more than a game."
President of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a great deal of pressure can soon collapse
Thomas Bjorn, head of the European team, knows from experience that a significant delay before the start of the single day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
In 1997, the Duanczyk had a match on the Valderram field, where he and his associate Vice-Captain Seve Balleteros had a five-point crossing over the Americas, but the meth line was short of possible hair, playing 141⁄2-131/2.
"It's not to be forgotten that we had a great advantage in the field of Valderram; we also had a great advantage in the field of Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the case of the valley of Valderram we won only hair," Bjorn said, on the picture, after the win 5-3 Class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday, which gave 10-6 to the field of Le Golf National.
Time will show me and all the members of the team that it's not over yet.
You're giving it all to yourself tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything you can.
The end will be only when the points appear on the table.
We have a goal to get a trophim, and we need to concentrate on it.
From the beginning, I said I've been gathering for 12 games that are on our side, but we also know very well who are people on the opposite side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn, quoted in the introduction to a difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do that better.
But tomorrow is something else.
They're starting to be single tomorrow, and that's another matter.
It's good to play with a partner when everything goes in mind, but when you play in one, your golf skills are tested to the limit of the possibility.
It's a message you have to send to the players, it's gonna give you everything tomorrow.
A partner must also give everything to himself."
Jim Furyk, in contrast to Bjorn, will be expected from his employees to achieve better results in a single than in a game with a partner, except Jordana Spietha and Justin Thomas, who won three points from four.
Sam Furyk experienced a great return to action last day, being a member of the winning team on the Brooklyn field, after which he made a mistake after the European team had done "a miracle on the field of Medina".
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question, how the captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, fought his employees in the last day.
“We play 12 important games tomorrow – you would like to start the game at a fast pace, as it was at the Brooklyn and Medina Poles.
If this bridge goes one side, there's a lot of pressure on the media games.
We set up our composition and set up boys in a way that would allow us to celebrate tomorrow."
Thomas has been entrusted with the task of conducting the contract, setting up Rory McIlroy's key game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahmow, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team staff in half of the programme.
"I've decided on this group of men in this sequence, because I think he's doing it all the time," Bjorn said about his single choice.
New German warships have been delayed
The latest flagship of the German warlord should be handed over to be used in 2014 to replace the ageing warheads of the Cold War, but it will not occur for at least one year, due to the worrisome arrangements and growth in the fear of cost – as local media have given.
The release to the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of the new class frigate class of Baden-Wuertertenberg was transferred to the first half of 2019, as the newspaper Die Zeit put it, calling for the words of the military speaker.
The vessel should be incorporated into the military mariner in 2014, but as a result of the problems arising after delivery, it was necessary to introduce changes in this ambitious project.
Four classes of Baden-Wuertmberg were ordered by the military Marine in 2007 to replace the aged Bremen class frigates.
They will, of course, be equipped with powerful work, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-aircrafts, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including the reduction of radar, blood and acoustic tracks.
Other important features include longer periods of preservation — the operation of new brakes should be possible even for two years from parental ports.
However, persistent delays indicate that these modern military routes, which will allow Germany to respond to situations beyond its borders, will be too late at the start of the service — notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the first pages of the newspaper last year when it was the German military Navy officially refused the ship to operate and returned it to the Blohm & Voss store in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Mariner returned the ship to the store after delivery.
A few were informed of the reasons for the return, but the German media reported a number of key "software and equipment" that made a useless turn in the war mission.
It was particularly important that the software error was due to the fact that the Baden-Wuertertenberg class ships should be operated by a crew of about 120 mariners, or less than half of the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is too heavy to reduce its achievements and reduces the possibility of carrying out military upgrades.
It is considered that the main 7000 tonnes of the Rhineland-Pfalz line is twice as heavy as those of German-like ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the sound equipment, the problem is also the cost of the entire project — including the training of the crew.
It is said that it reached a lowering level of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), while the initial cost amounted to EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the use of new frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the forces of the German fleet of the sea will be involved.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, admitted that the mariners “are going to be able to use ships”.
He also said that this problem has increased from time to time the effects of the removal of old units without the provision of replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his discontent with the fact that none of the class frigates of Baden-Wuertertenberg could not be included in the sailboat fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of non-perpetuals
New studies conducted on the property field in the Highlands are aimed at showing how non-toperals use the landscape while enjoying food.
It is expected that the results of the tests will shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional droplets and will help to focus on future actions for their protection.
Research conducted by researchers from National Trust for Scotland will involve young and young boys, as well as Brazilian long-distance and non-uppressives from the Inverwe Gardens family in West Ross.
In key locations around the property, special registries will be placed to monitor the overall activity of non-temperature.
NHS workers and volunteers will also carry out field studies using portable detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings is designed to determine the frequency of the signals sent by the intemperature and the manner in which the individual species are kept.
A seating map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their country-wide behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural protection consultant in the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the seat are the most important for non-perpetuals and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of work related to the management of seats, such as the creation of wool, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for non-temperatures and other related species.
The population of non-temperatures in Scotland and throughout Great Britain has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the soil and the loss of the seat.
Air turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, such as soft dust and certain chemical measures used in construction materials, and even household kits.
They're not really smart.
However, due to nighttime routines, their ears are more helpful than the eyes in the grip of winning.
They use a complex eco-location technique to search for jobs and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organization, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 residential buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, deals very seriously with non-competitively.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, field control, and sometimes even recreational activities.
The organization even established the first and the only reserve dedicated in Scotland to the estate of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is a home for eight of the 10 great non-peripheral species.
David Thompson, the owner of the property, says she's for the inequity of an ideal territory.
"Threave has a great area for non-toperitis," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees, and sign a seat.
However, there are still a lot of strangers who are not aware of this problem. The work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of controlling the occurrence of non-perpetuals prior to accession to conservation work in the holdings, as the indiscriminate destruction of one village could kill 400 Samim and young people, which could lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
They are vulnerable — their murder, rape, or destruction, and their destruction is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged public opinion to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our shortcomings, and in many cases we don’t even know how their populations feel. ”
Ronaldo rejects complaints about fraud, while his lawyers intend to call German stores
Cristian Ronaldo has defined the charges against him concerning fraud as “fake news”, saying that people “want to promote” using his name.
His lawyers intend to call the German media store Der Spiegel, who published these warrants.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was charged with rape by the American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the fifth report, Der Spiegel's driver had to pay a woman $375,000 for a loan.
Ronaldo (33 years old), a few hours after the announcement of arrest, in an instagram of life translated into his 142 million followers, identified these references as “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's delivery is fake news" – said a five-fold winner of the gold ball.
"They want to promote, using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by speaking my name, but it's part of my work.
I'm happy and it's all right," added the driver with a smile on his mouth.
Lawyers Ronaldo are preparing to appeal to the magazine Der Spiegel in connection with the arrests called “unacceptable notification of suspicions in the field of privacy” – as Reuters submits.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the driver would be able to compensate for “the moral damage in the amount of the violation which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
In June 2009, she had a place in the hotel room Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Maorga also went to the bedroom, where they reportedly beat the woman anally — as a result of the documents filed by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Maiorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the river and said that “99 percent is a good guy” who was visited by that “one percent.”
According to Ronaldo's documentation, he confirmed that the couple were having sex, but that was a general agreement.
Maiorga also claims that she went to the police and that she took pictures of her beliefs in the hospital, but later she agreed to the emergency agreement because she was "dangerous" and "public abuse".
The 34-year-old says he wants to make an agreement now because he can't still forget about the river.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to the reality of Madrid, and this year he moved to Juventus after paying for it amounting to EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain "after all the time it'd rain" the departure of car manufacturers
Britain's great "will regret it all the time" if after leaving the European Union it lost the status of world leader in the production of cars, Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that "he was worried," when the representative of Toyota UK told the BBC that if the Great Britain leaves the EU without agreement, production in the factory in Burnaston would soon be suspended temporarily.
"We need agreements," said Clark.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays on borders in the absence of agreement on Brexit could lead to reduced jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, in which the Auris and Avensis models are produced, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, with 90% being exported to the other European Union countries.
"I think that if the Great Britain departs at the end of March with no agreement from the European Union, then the production stop will take place in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of the Toyota company in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW is planning to close its Mini car factory in Oxford months after Brexicia.
The main concerns are, as the car manufacturers claim, the risks associated with the supply chain if the European Union is left without agreement by the Great Britain.
Toyoty's production line works on the basis of a "just-in-time" line, where the parts reach at least 37 minutes from suppliers both in Britain and in the EU in the case of vehicles manufactured for sale.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, it may face difficulties at the border, which, according to the representative of the industry, may lead to delays and disadvantages.
As the company representative said, Toyota would not be able to stay for more than one day without delivery to his factory in Derbyshire, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said that the Plan of Chequers Theresy May on future EU relations is "precisely designed to avoid border controls".
"We need agreements: we want to achieve the best possible agreements that will not only make us happy with the present success but also enable us to make the right use of this situation," said BBC Radio 4.
"The statements not only toyoty, but also other producers testify that we must be able to continue what was on the very real set of supply chains."
The representative of Toyoty was unable to determine how long the production would continue, but he warned that, in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, which would lead to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been a member of the U.S. Federal Board for 24 years, said that members of the association are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if the job is lost, they will never be returned.
The Governor said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union."
The meeting with Rosensteine can be delayed by giving the White House
The important meeting of Donalda Trumpa with the Deputy Prosecutor General Rode Rosensteine could be "recorded for next week" due to the inconsistencies of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, as he gave the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines the possibility of Russia's interference in the elections, the relationship between the close associates of Trupa and Russia, and the potential difficulties of the President's exercise of justice.
Whether Trump will release the Deputy Prosecutor General, threatening the same independence of Mueller, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about having an interview with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from the position on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein has rejected these imports.
The following Monday, however, he went to the White House in the form of contributions, as he had to submit to the dynamism.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was currently at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not release Rosenstein. A meeting was held to avoid colliding with the hearing of a senate judicial committee, during which reports were made by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump conducted a weekly FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in Senate.
Trumpa, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News station.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There is no time left for this meeting, it may take place this week and may be transferred for the next week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'm sure I'll inform you about this."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders did not hold a press conference on the White House since September 10.
The monitoring program, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by a lack of "expensive" television journalists, which she added: "I will not hide that they are "experts".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and ask for greater contact.
"The Vice-President shall hold more "questions and answers" sessions than any other President before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have met with numbers".
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to direct the President of the United States questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done it very often. Press conferences will take place at a session where we can talk directly to the President of the United States."
The trumpet shall be answered on a regular basis when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting engineers.
The solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why he is so, acting too freely and sometimes strangely before the gathered journalists.
Minister of Health letters to workers from the European Union employed in NHS Scotland due to concerns related to Brexit
The Minister for Health has written a letter to workers from the European Union's countries employed in the Czech health service in order to convey expressions of appreciation from the country and to ask them not to leave the country of Brexis.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish court has already committed itself to covering the costs of examining applications for "setled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Last year negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union continue, and appropriate decisions will be taken this year.
The British court also intensified the preparation of a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know it's a very stressful time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.

Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery due to head injury
The Tennesse State Tigers Group, Christion Abercrombie, passed the operation due to the head injury in a Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodes, which ended with a breach with the Tennessee team from 31-27, reported Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of the Tennessee State team, told the journalist that the contractor had discovered an accident shortly before the end of the first half.
"He went to the side line after he lay down on the ground," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie the back on the side line, then put it on the noses, and carried out further studies.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/size of the injury", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the attack occurred.
Abercrombie (second-year-old student who was released from college to acquire his skills) plays his first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the game, he had five cheeses, which gives him 18 cheeses throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be obliged to pay higher taxes when buying real estate in Great Britain
In accordance with the new tourist plans of foreign buyers, higher tax charges will be paid for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom. The measures will thus be granted for the benefit of the homeless.
This is a gathering that has to undo Jeremy Corbin's actions aimed at attracting the young electrician.
The higher fees are for persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Customs provides that even 120 million dollars will be received annually by homeless people.
Theresa May today informs us that the purchaser of property in Great Britain will be charged a higher fee and that additional measures will be provided for in this way to help the homeless.
This meeting is considered to be an attempt to eliminate Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young electorates to dance rooms and to increase the burden of more recruiting people.
The higher fees will be charged to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional measures will help the government in the fight against unemployment.
An additional fee — paid in addition to the current tax rate, including those two years earlier, for other houses and for housing purchased for rent — may amount to three per cent.
The state's cost is expected to allow this merger to cost up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and difficulty in buying the first house or apartment.
Because many circuit overseers buy property, and most of the time they spend abroad, many of the eligible regions — and especially the table — have become “the city of spirit. ”
The new rules come in a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the wage, which would help young people to buy the first house.
He accused large dewelopers of maintaining high prices of property by taking over the land, but not using it. He also called the Prime Minister May to remove the limits of these dwellings in order to undermine the "hospital scandal" in Great Britain.
Jeremy Corbin announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including regulation of actions and the end of the "no reason".
It also wants to give local authorities greater powers to build new houses.
Theresa May said: “In the past year, I said that as a prime minister, I was engaged in the construction of the British Navy so that the life of each generation would be better than before.
It also means the restoration of our popular housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy here what the British residents are working hard.
For too many people, getting away from their own home has become very distant, and that is why the rest of the night's sleep on the street is still real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to be a Scotch elector"
Sunderland's team coach, Jack Ross, says his "greatest ambition" is to be a Scottish elector at some point.
This 40-year-old Scot is engaged in the healing of the North-East Club, which currently takes third place in League One with a three-point loss compared to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this year after he introduced the St. Mirren Club in the last season with a return to Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to represent my country as an entrepreneur,
But I only managed to get to frame B," said Ross in a report to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“As a child, I often watched with the father of the Skoci game in Hampden, and it always touched me.
However, this opportunity will come only under the condition that I will be successful as a coach club."
Among the presidents of Ross at the position of Coach Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach Alla Athletic says he doesn't feel embarrassed, taking a role in such significant personalities in such a large club, rejecting previous proposals from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"I'm sure you'll be lucky if I can get this club back to Premier League.
Taking into account its structure and the satisfaction it has, there is no doubt its place” — it adds.
"It won't be easy to do this, but I'm sure I've been successful here, provided I can."
He has been a trainer's assistant in Dumbarton for only three years, and for 15 months he has been a training team for Hearts.
Next, Alla helped reactivate the third league, and in the next season he led the St. Mirren team to hide the fall to the master title.
Jack Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than when he was playing at Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a real turning point" – so it is mentioned by coach Alla's position.
"I really believed that driving a team is much better than just a joke.
It's a surprise, because as an employee, I've worked well and I've achieved a few reasonable successes.
It's a hard piece of bread, though.
Every week, you have to get through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure related to the work of the coach, but I feel good about this role.
I always wanted to train others and now I can say that at this point I feel the most in my entire adult life."
All announcements in Sports Sound can be heard on Sunday, 30 September on Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST time
Studies show that the best time for beer is 17.30 a.m. on Saturday.
The fall of the waves caused the massive influence of customers on British pubs, but it turned out to be a joke in restaurants.
Studies showed that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants it fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA, who developed data, says: “The steady rise and longer than England’s share in the Middle East was expected to result in similar redsizing from July, when it grew by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the sugarcane of the restaurant dropped even more.
In June, the sales drop in restaurants in July increased even further.
The offer of beer and beer made the best decision — their sales growth exceeded the cost of restaurants.
Puppies serving food also endured during meals, although not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just got caught up in it.
The sale of alcohols in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month, and food fell by 3 per cent".
Paul Newman from RSM, an analysis of the intelligence and tourism industry, says: “These results are recorded in the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the size of consumption 'on the outside of the house' are the weather and major sports or business events.
The fact that the restaurants are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although sales drop by 4.8 per cent compared with the previous year will have a particularly impact if it takes into account the constant cost reduction burden.
The long and exciting year has come at the least useful time for local food and time owners to show whether any more moderate temperatures that we had in the summer will bring about such a need for extraction."
The joint increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these new openings, resulted in 2.7% in July, which reflected a slowdown in the development of marek.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is involved in monitoring sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in Britain, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One in five children has a secret account in social media that is hidden from parents
Studies have shown that one out of five children — some 11 years of age — has a secret account in social networks that covers parents and teachers.
Ankieta, conducted among the 20,000 students of the secondary school, showed an increase in the number of pages “fake Insta”
The news was alarmed that they had been published about sex.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account showing their parents
One for five children — some 11 years of age or older — is a social network that does not reveal adults.
Ankieta, conducted among the 20,000 students of the Postgraduate School, showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts — a name related to the Instagram service in which photos can be shared.
They were concerned about the fact that these accounts serve to publish content about the sexual nature of the account.
Twenty percent of the students admitted that they have a negative "main" account showing their parents, and they also have a private account.
One of the mothers, who, in case she went to the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter, found a teenager who invited others to “take her away. ”
A study conducted in independent schools by the Digital Avaress UK and the Association of Headmasters" and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 years are conducting two profiles.
HMC’s Association Press, Mike Buchanan, says: “It’s overwhelming that so many teenagers create their own places on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them. ”
Elid Doyle will become “a voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletics administration
During the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Eliid Doyle, the Executive Director was elected.
Eilid Doyle is the most famous electrician. President Ian Beattie has identified this as a perfect opportunity for people who manage sports to benefit from her rich international experience that she has gained in the last decade.
"There is a great deal of respect for the Scottish, British and world athletes, and we are sure that introducing them to the government will bring great benefits to Scottish athletes," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very happy that I will have the opportunity to deliver to the sports council, and I hope that I can really help in managing sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who, among its four Olympic gold medals, has won 200 to 400 metres on the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and is now regularly in BBC as an expert, cannot lead to a bloodthirsty attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke the month before.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show me whether I'm getting justice and how much.
It was a catholic job, but in full health, I learned to go back to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
lactators ’ advertising that compares breast to breast cancer stimulates a wide range of emotions on the Internet
The company producing the lactator has launched an online stock market, publishing a advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers to broken blood.
In order to announce the introduction to the market of "the first black lactator in the world to wear under cover", Elvie, his producer, published a ridiculous advertising in the form of a television, which highlights the freedom he will give to his mother.
She presents four real moms dancing in a full-fledged scene to the creature in which she hears the words, "Yes, I do, but don't see the fire" and "If you didn't notice, it's not just my bikes."
The refren goes further: “I will blow her up, I will blow her up, I will feed her, I will blow her up, I will kill her. ”
The advertising that was published on the Facebook page of the company has raised a great deal of controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77 thousand views and a set of comments. Users express a great deal of opinion, many of them argue that it is inappropriate to engage in a "horror" that has a place in the milk industry.
"The use of blood to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people who want to milk, they have to go into pregnancy and give birth to babies, including their children being taken a few days from birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie's company lactator can carry no note under boustonism to karmine (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “It is, of course, traumatic for both mother and child.
All right, let's use the roofs to advertise lactators for mothers who can keep their children."
Another added: “This advertising is totally foreign to reality. ”
Another gun of the clip — one of the women claimed that the song was “a fun. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I'd still warm my chest, I'd buy myself that way.
I felt like a cow when I took off my food.
The claim is a little crazy, but I'm not investigating it the second day.
It's a great invention," someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s fun advertising to a mother who takes food (often at work or toilet) and feels like 'blood'.
It is not intended to undermine or criticise the milk industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that women were dancing with lactating lactators deliberately into the breast.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many pregnant women felt like a cow.
However, the lactator Elvie is completely quiet, has no cables or wheels, and can carry him undetected under the yoke of pregnancy, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the children on their hands, and even get out of the house while the food is taken away.
Ana Balarin, a creative partner and director of Mother’s company, said: “Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he served as a brave and provocative prime minister.
By putting together the kind of women and milk cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with the withdrawal of food, presenting a fair and consistent sense of freedom that he will provide.
It's not the first time the lactator Elvie found it on the cell phone.
While London Fashion Week on the show of Marty Jakubowski on the run, the mother of two children with this particular product appeared.
Hundreds of children of immigrants have been slowly transferred to a native camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by immigrants is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border every month has not changed. This is due to part of the fact that the serious return and rules introduced by President Trupa's administration have forced children to be placed in sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually also undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being deported if they report to the child.
Such risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that there would be a collection of fingerprints from potential sponsors and other adult persons living in the common economy, which will then be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, an elder official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, Matthew Albence, announced before the Congress that his agency had arrested dozens of people who had become sponsors for children left without care.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested were not previously reported.
“At least 80 per cent of people who are sponsors or live with them in one domestic economy are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminals in the past.
That is why we will not stop following them," said Albence.
Professional workers say that within the framework of efforts to speed up the situation of children, officials introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, according to previous standards.
Much will be done through the video conference, not personally, to ask an immigration judge to legislate their status.
Those who do not qualify for exemption will be deported immediately.
According to staff and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in arrest, the easier it can be to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to aggression or attempted suicide.
The defences found that these problems are even more serious in the case of larger centres, such as Tornillo, where, in view of its easier size, it is to pass signals that something bad happens with a child.
They also added that the transfer of children to the orphanage without providing them with the right time to prepare emotional or to deal with friends can strengthen the trauma that many of them already experience.
Syria calls the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" for immediate withdrawal
During his visit to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moualam, also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, although the war in this country lasted for eight years.
Moulal, who also plays the role of the Vice-President, said that the citizens of Syria are illegally living in the country, in the context of the fight against terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They have to break out immediately and unconditionally," he said to the Assembly.
Moulalem says that "the war with terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 thousand people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to “take its sacred battle to clear the territory of Syria” both from terrorist groups and from“ all its illegal residents”.
In Syria, there are now about 2000 American soldiers, who are primarily trained by Kurdish and Syrian forces who oppose President Baszar al-Assad and advise them.
In addition, more than 1,000 French soldiers are found in the country that was destroyed.
In the case of refugees, Moulal found that the conditions are good enough for them to return, and charged “some of the western countries” with“ the awakening of unorthodox fear”, which discourages them from returning.
"We have asked international society and humanitarian organizations for help in these returns," he said.
"They policy things that ought to have a clean human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that as long as President Assad does not oppose the political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any help to rebuild it.
The UN diplomats say that the last agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebellion in Idlib has created the possibility of continuing political talks.
The Association between Russia and Turkey has helped to prevent a large attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province where three million people live.
However, Moulalem stressed that the agreement has a "explanatory time frame" and expressed the hope that military action will be measured in dissidents, including fighters associated with Al-Qaida Front of the Protection of the People of Lebanon, who will be "restricted".
The UN spokesman, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to call soon the first meeting of the new committee composed of members of the governing party and opposition in order to draw up a course of the military constitution in Syria and prepare for elections.
Moulalem stressed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Commission, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "to verify the records of the present constitution" and to warn against interference.
Why Trump Responsibilities
According to this logic, President Trump would have been elected on a second term in 2020, although, as many liberal observers are sure, his presidency would end earlier with the removal of the office and scandal.
It would certainly be “the most dramatic end of the presidency”.
As a matter of fact, there's no sign of visual impairment.
Since 2014, the results of the CNN channel have been doubled and reached 1.05 million, and the MSNBC channel has almost reached 1.6 million.
According to the Nielsen Fox News agency, an average of 2.4 million views in hours of maximum visibility, resulting in an increase of 1.7 million in four years, and the highest results in the MSNBC channel "The Rachel Maddow Show" have been achieved in cable television, bringing up to 3.5 million views of evening information programs.
"People treat us like a fire – that's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the main producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor" about the secretary of the office who, after the attack on the Capitol, becomes president.
Nell Scowell, experienced comedy manufacturer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She recalls how she went to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he laughs at me," he replied.
"Chaos has a divorce value."
Of course, bringing from Washington could be like nothing else shown on television to judge the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of connecting immigrant families or the state of the world economy.
Excluded is a luxury that can only allow for the most acceptable sights.
Besides, it's not just about being well-informed citizens when you see a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward from secret informants when writing the book "Fear", about Paula Manaforta's chart from the skin of the 15 000 dollars (the "overloaded sand" according to The Washington Post) or about the implications of looking at the details of the presidental anatomics revealed by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario as much as I used to.
"What he does, in part, recalls the reality of the show in this regard as to what the evening brings new content," said Brent Montgomery, director General Wheelhouse Entertainment and author Pawn Stars, about changing the scope and daily returns of the events of the Show Trump (as an attack on NFL or Kim Dzong Una's reputation).
You can't allow yourself to lose the baby, because you'll be pregnant.
When I met Mike Fleissem this week, the weather on the northern coast of the island of Kuai, where he had his house, was great, but he sat in the middle, watching MSNBC and playing CNN at the same time.
It was not possible to avoid this when Brett Kavanaugh stood right before the Court of Justice of the Senate and considered the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were kidding, but it turns out they were right."

The impact of foreign money on the Congress's campaign
It is not surprising that following the reorganization of electoral circuits, resulting in a single position, there will now be two present-day congressmen, until the 17th round of the Pennsylvania electoral district, the river of cash flow.
This newly established area area of Pittsburgh is represented by the Democratic Representative of the Congress, Conor Lamb, who received his place in the other district during the special elections of the former village.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now represented by the 12th in Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the new 17th.
The maps of the districts were corrected by the Constitutional Court of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which claimed that the old districts had been marked by injustice, which had led the Republican crossing and was incompatible with the Constitution.
In the new context of the 17th round, the campaign was launched on the financing of the party's main funding bodies — Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) commissions and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after the fall of hair in the widely commented elections to the 18th round of the election that took place in March.
He has been in the Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this area.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little bit of a pass.
The United States considered Salwador's murder to support China, but they disappeared from that idea.
The diplomats noted that Dominicans and Panama already recognized Pekin, despite the mild opposition of Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump met with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varel, and at the time of the departure of the management team of the Trump Organization company, he had a hotel in Panama.
The officials of the Department of State decided to call the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to stop Taiwan's recognition", as the Department's spokesman, Heather Nauert, said in his statement this month.
However, the sanctions were to be imposed only on Salvador, which, according to estimates in 2017, received from the United States $140 million assistance between others in the fight against drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which would include restrictions on financial assistance and recognition of certain persons, would be very relevant to this Central American country, which is faced with a high unemployment rate and high mortality rate.
In the course of the international meetings, the North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference on security and economic well-being in order to make proposals from a similar assembly from the last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from being delivered to the United States.
In the half of September, the highest level of administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus completing any consideration of the sanctions against Salvador.
The diplomats say that now at the conference that is currently scheduled for half of October, Vice-President Mike Pence will be present, which will be a sign of a call for the representatives of the administration to be gathered.
Three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and Dominicans, and they did not accompany any new raw communications or war from Washington.
John Bolton of the White House rejected the comment on the details of the debate presented by the three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal proceedings under the terms of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by external analysis of the area of administration, which was also anonymous.
Learn From History
The next element may be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Mueller, on the possible difficulty in the exercise of justice by President Trumpa, which currently provides concrete publicly available evidence.
According to the findings, Robert Mueller's investigation also raises the question whether Donald Trumpa's campaign had something in common with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If the composition of the Congress is changed, President Trump will be held accountable during preparations for the re-examination of the elections and may even be judged before the jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trupa — or those on its balance sheets in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which determines how long it can be confirmed.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to make a siege against Hitler if only the West would stand against him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It didn't work out, and we lost the chance to avoid the years that followed.
The following stories are around such recurring points, speeding up or strengthening the unfavourable legacy of democracy.
There are now a few such points in front of the Americans.
What will we do if Donald Trump release the Attorney General Roda Rosenstein, a man from whom the future of Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our newspaper that last year he proposed a clever recording of the president and speculated that he does not rely on that authority.
According to Rosenstein, the relationship presented by The Times is incomplete.
“How do we react if the new FBI investigation concerning Bretta Kavanaugh appears to be incomplete or unjust, or if it is referred to as the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court, despite its credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we, in half of the presidential term, choose to attend the Congress of Persons who will take Donald Trump to the responsibility?
If we don't pass these tests, it'll be hard times for democracy.
I believe, however, that we will succeed because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever taken over my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to burn safasa candles on that so-called sushi table.
Having such a legacy, how could I not look optimistic in the future?"

Commander of the Rangers Club, Graham Dorrans, with optimism waiting for a match with the Rapid Vienna team
Rangers take the Rapid Witnesses on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory with Austria, won after the impressive return of Villareal to Spain this month, has significantly increased their chances of qualifying from the G League of Europe.
Until the 2:2 mission of Villareal, the concussion of the knee prevented the assistant Graham Dorras's game in this season, but he believes that it worked on the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"It has done us well because Villarreal is in good shape," said the 31st year.
“We went to this game with faith that we would achieve something – and we fought a point.
Maybe at the end we could still press them, but the overall remedy is a fair outcome.
Spain was probably better in the first half, but second, we were better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope we can get three points, but this game will be difficult because our opponent has achieved a good outcome in our last match.
The last year was a difficult decision because of everything related to my conscience and changes in the same club, but now we all feel good in our own places.
The guy's great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we'll let the council go further, leave the last season behind and bring success."
Fear of amerital survival in women from the field
Although the participants knew exactly how they wanted to be involved, few talked to their family about it.
In a study conducted by the Nationalvide company, about half of the participants found that she spoke with a partner about the costs of long-term care.
Lastly 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take part in this conversation," said Holly Snyder, a vice president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
What's the start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You don’t prepare your family to take care of yourself if you don’t express your will in advance.
With the counselor and the family, you will discuss where and how you want to be cared for, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for financial advice: He may help find ways to pay these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from traditional police to such care, hybrid police, which enables you to pay cash to cover such expenses or from your own property — if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: You will avoid this court battles.
Mark a trusted healthcare professional who will monitor and monitor it so that the persons concerned will act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider, too, the full-time employment of the fundee.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and will keep all the accounts paid if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget details: Imagine that your parents in later years need medical help immediately and just go to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?

A man repeatedly fired from the winds in Ilfracombe
The man was fired several times from the window when he returned home from the evening party.
The 14th century was located around Oxford Grove in the town of Ilfracombe in Devon, when he was shot in a prairie, blouse, and hand.
The police identified the shooting that took place about 02:30 BST time, as "instant action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the fifth Indonesian city of Palu. The number of victims will increase.
Because of the cursed communication, the trainers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongya kupatten, which is located in the north of Palu, near the earthquake site at 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster with Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the conquest of Donghea on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Celebes Central, a province located at the end of the summer season on the western coast of the island. It is estimated that in 2017, 379 800 people were accommodated.
When the earthquake hit the city, the 40th anniversary of its siege lasted.
Donghea is a kupatten (a lower administrative unit) extending along the north-west coast of the island for over 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017, 299,200 people lived in it.
The main disadvantages of the Mediterranean Celebes economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal coast of Donghea.
Another source of income from the province is a total of nickel, but they are mainly located in Morozal, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the last 100 years, the earthquake and tsunamis visited Palau and Donginga several times.
In 1938, the tsunami that struck Dongheza killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996 the tsunami killed nine people in western Donghei.

The oldest son of Sary Palin arrested under domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor Alaski and candidate to the vice president,Sary Palin, was arrested under the threat.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from the town of Vasilla on Alaska, 29 years old, he was arrested with domestic violence, forced to submit a report and put an end to arrest.
According to the police report, when the suspect's friends tried to call the police to make the crime complete, he took her phone.
The KTUU station reports that Palin is in the arrest of Mat-Su's successor and has a fine of 500 dollars.
According to her information on the last Saturday, he stood before the court, where he stated in his defense that he was “probably innocent. ”
In Palinia there are three class A developments, which means he can get a penalty even for prison year and $250,000 gross.
It was also charged with the promotion of Class B, which threatened the prison day's pay and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time Palin's wounds are formed.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is now before the Alaskan Court of Justice of the Veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forced to make a declaration and possession of weapons as a result of this incident.
His partner says he hit her face.
In 2016 a group of veterans called on Saru Palin, who linked the aggressive behaviour of his son with the Prussian stress team, which he acquired during his service in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors call for death sentences for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York are calling for the death penalty for the alleged terrorist attack in New York, resulting in the death of eight people. It is a rare punishment — it has not been committed in this state as a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out an attack that took place in October on the road along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan, the thirty-year-old Saipov used a used Home Depot truck, which drove fish and rovers on his way.
According to the Southern District of New York, in order to justify its necessity, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed eight victims and that “the whole” caused serious physical abuse.
According to the court document for both of these crimes, the death penalty is serious.
A few weeks after the attack by the federal court, Saipov presented a 22-point charge, including eight murder warrants, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a ban on the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and thinking". The way Saipov conducted it was defined as "generous, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov brought guilt, damage and loss to his family and friends Diego Enrique Angeliniego, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pannucca," says the report.
Five of the victims were citizens of Argentina who lived in New York City.
The last death penalty was imposed ten years ago in the southern part of New York City.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the wine murder of two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he heard a life sentence.
The death penalty was last executed in New York in 1953 on July and Ethel Rosenbergch. The marriage was lost after two years of being considered guilty of conspiracy and aggression against the Soviet Union during the winter war.
Both Rosenbergs were lost on 19 June 1953.
According to the Saipov case documents from Uzbekistan, within a month of the attack, he did not show any summary findings.
The police claim that he told his followers that he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipov's accusation, the authorities found him inspired by ISIS films that he was watching on the phone.
According to the police, he also managed to raise the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
The case-law, which contains 22 sentences, is liable to be invalid.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders representing Saipova, said that they are "for obvious reasons disturbed" the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty and to refuse to live without the possibility of an early release only prolonged suffering caused by these events to all interested people," he said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors earlier not to ask for the death penalty.
Parliamentarian of the Tours says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the Tours Conference, Nigel Farage agreed to “improve the arms of the people”.
The leader of the United Kingdom's Independence Party (UKIP) said that policies must be "sounded" by Eurosceptics when one of the MPs Theresy May suggested that they should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Deputies from the Conservatives, Peter Bonne, told a demonstration in Birmingham that if Farage was a secretary of Brexit, “the United Kingdom would already be outside the Union”.
However, the association of tortures claiming to remain in the community to be a personal protest against Brexito, which took place in the city, further emphasized the seriousness of the commitment of its deeply divided ranks before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is making it difficult to implement his compromise plan with Chequers between attacks by Brexit's allies, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Her associates claim that despite the opposition, she will be able to conclude an agreement with Brussels and the need for Eurosceptics and the labs to make a choice between her proposal and "chaosm".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "reject a plan from Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be given full responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had done that, we would now be outside the Union," he said.
Wellingborough added: "I support Brexit, but we need to get out of Chequers."
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in the world wars to defeat anyone now.
We want to establish our rights in our own country."
Peter Bonne rejected the suggestion that citizens have changed their opinion since the vote in 2016: "The British think that they have changed their opinion and want to stay in the Union is completely wrong."
The demonstration was also attended by Brexit Andrea Jenkins from a tour party who told the reporter: “I'm just saying, Mrs. Primer, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not happy with general support, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists who are loading the streets and who have chosen us, nor will they support it.
Please drop the plan from Chequers and start listening."
In a speech addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: “Principals keep their positions when they keep their promise. ”
Nigel Farage stated that the policy taking part in the demonstration must be "slower" if they have to reverse the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is the issue of trust between us, people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them 'We're not letting you do it'."
Turning to the dispersioned mob, he added: “I wish you would make the politics that are at the border of Brexit’s fate feel hot.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the Brexia referendum, and we will not start until we become independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At the time, the opponents of Brexit expanded through the city into the center where the two-year demonstration took place.
The activists' Garst made the banners "Touris against Brexit" after the group was set up this weekend.
Laborers' activist, baron Andrew Adonis, mocked the conservatists for problems with the security of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who claim to be able to organize information systems and all technology to support Canada's plan plus, a river border, free trade with Ireland," he added.
‘It's a complete phrase.
There's nothing like the good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "really consider" the president's application
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "the president's application is seriously considered".
According to The Boston Globe, the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a meeting with the voters who took place on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donalda Trumpa, will be re-elected in November. Her opponent will be the representative of the Republican, Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Trumpa campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that in the elections in 2020, Warren can defeat Trump.
The Saturday event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electors in the town hall formula, since Donald Trump took over the board.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to apply for a president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “the women to go to Washington to correct our corrupt government — and she is also thinking of the woman on her own. ”

The Baton Rouge police in the state of Luizjana reported on a Saturday arrest suspected of a fifth shooting in which the LSU group, Wade Sims, died.
The police department at Baton Rouge reported the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson during the conference, which took place at 11:00 a.m. on the east.
On Friday, a shooting recording was published asking for help in identifying the man who was visible on it.

Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the team's recommendation enabled him to win from Sebastian Vettel
Since the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team's recommendations will have a great impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and soon defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and forced Vettel to attack his colleague from the team.
The winner went to the service point for the first time and allowed Hamilton to go into the gallon fire to decide what to do about the lakes of the river.
Lieutenant Mercedes went to the box in the next round and appeared after Vettel, but after an action around him, as a result of which the manager Ferrari suddenly left the inner part of the tower, risking a fall to the defense after a double-run fishing effort aimed at protecting the position on the third floor, Hamilton moved on to conduct.
Max Verstappen started at the end of his class and at the end of his 21-year-olds at the end of the first round, he found himself in the seventh place.
He then conducted a large part of the race because he did not change his mind in order to carry out the fast finish and the fourth position of Kimi Raikkone.
In the end, he went to the service point on the 44th round, but in the other eight rounds he couldn't speed up any more.
"It was a hard day because the entire weekend Valtteri did a great job and showed himself to the real gentleman when he was told to leave me.
The whole group gave it everything to take two first places," said Hamilton.
It was really bad my body.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump spoke with Senator Diana Feinstein, who held that she did not reveal the content of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in the West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the reports made by Christin Ford before the Senate Commission, but stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “stupid, baseless and lying”.
"What could have happened is one, but this beautiful situation in the Senate which we have been witnesses for a few days when we see evil when we see people who are angry, baseless, corrupt and lying," he said.
"We see what has been published and published, and then they tell us 'oh, I didn't do it'.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Deanno Feinstein, did you find out?
Do you remember her answer... or did you reveal the content of this document? - and, and, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we explain... No, we didn't do it," he added, ignoring the senator.
Diana Feinstein received from Christin Ford a list with a description of the siege against Kavanaugh in July, and his content ran out at the beginning of September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the commission, as The Hill newspaper reports.
"She asked me for a discrepancy and I did not disclose these contents in accordance with her request."
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented at the Saturday meeting: “I’m telling you, it was really bad my body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing to defend the candidate in the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that the Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take all measures.
They don't care who's wrong, who they have to destroy to take over power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite services.

In the region, there are still strong floods of Tuesdays. In the city of Palu, many people have been trapped in caves.
Despite his colleagues running away, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat at the cooled airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was there to find out that the Batik Air line flight (lot number 6321), which was located just on the starting pass, was safely launched.
Then he jumped off the wall when it seemed to him that they were in trouble.
He died in the hospital.
According to Australia's ABC News firm Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait said that the decision of the controller probably saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We organized a smile from the city of Balikpapan to Borneo to move him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, Antonius left this morning before he reached the palace.
"This message broke our hearts," he added.
At the same time, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims of death may be 1,000. The national disaster relief agency informs that access to the cities of Donghe, Sig and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the fate of death continues to increase, as many bodies continue to be under the clouds and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugro.
The six - foot - long [6 m] fall of lions destroyed the Palu, where a massive funeral of the victim will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.

She's going to miss drinking water.
The small holes are filled."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia Red Cross sleeps on the ground, but we don’t know what to stand for.
It's already a tragedy, and it can be even worse."

A car crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini lines show that one person has been killed after the plane crash
The flight lines that were operating on a plane in Micronesia in the Pacific inform us that one person has been killed. Previously, all 47 passengers and crew members have been safely evacuated from the plane.
Air Niugini reported that on Saturday afternoon no man could be appointed to travel on a feral plane.
They made sure that they, together with local authorities, hospitals and followers, tried to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the aircraft hit the water during the attempt to land on the Chuuk island, the rest of the passengers and crew helped local ships.
The officials informed on Friday that seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airlines said that on Saturday there were six other passengers in the hospital, all in a stable state.
It's not clear what caused the disaster.
The U.S. Army Airline and Marines claim that the plane was on the plane shortly after the start of the flight.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of the dog.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said that the plane was very low.
"It really helped us," he said.
Well, Janes said he and other people were able to get the water out of the dangerous tonne plane.
According to him, the crew members panicked and screamed, and he himself took a terrible headache.
The U.S. military officer told us that the navigational action also helped mariners who were working closely to modernize the weather. The boat was able to transport people on board before the plane sank about 30 metres deep.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database in the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in the planes registered in Papua New Guinea. However, there are no Air Niugini.
Analytical reconstructed events from the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor concluded the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman's alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analysis by the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, has long recognized as a fugitive court in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how he opened the 29-year-old prosecution, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As the journalist Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he got the location data from various cell phones that showed that the fair night Tellis was from Chambers.
When the data confirmed that at the time Quinton was supposed to live with his friends, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was with Jessica Chambers, the police decided to listen to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford admitted that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in the Sanforda camp that night, he replied that he “did lie because my uncle was then in Nashville. ”
Another misunderstanding is Tellis' claim that he knew Chambers for about two weeks.
The phone records showed that they've known each other for weeks.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact data from her phone, as well as SMS and communications.
"He took her away from her life," said Hale.
The final defense should begin on Sunday.
The judge said that it would probably still be the same day that the case would be handed over to the jury.

Ninja from New York takes a couple to release after "grastim" SMS
Niania from New York is a couple who are leaving her job on the ground of racism after getting the wrong SMS, in which the child’s mother complains that she is a "all black person".
The couple refuse, as if they were racists, comparing the call to "santaze".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly contrasted when it turned out that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, who was your first day at work in 2016, is a blacksmith.
“NIEE, CZARNA OSOBA’ – wrote in SMS to the husband.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to New York Post, when Plato-Flaxman thought he was in charge of a full-fledged gaffe, Gisell Maurice released, claiming that a heart attack, which is an American, had failed to carry out his duties, and was also expected from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for the day's work, and then she was sent to Uber's house.
It is now expected to be paid off by a couple of fines for the release of $350 a day, multiplied by six months, to which she was initially employed by the resident, although she did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," said the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple's defense charges against racism, claiming that the end of cooperation with Mrs Maurice was justified, because after she was shot, they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t intend to say.
It's not racist.
We're not racists," said Posto's husband, Joel Plasco.
"Would you believe your children who have committed sins, even if they were guilty?
Your new baby?
Give me a break."
Comparing the call to “santaze”, Plasco said his wife was born just two months earlier and was in “very difficult situation”.
“Do you intend to do something like this?
This is not too nice," he added the investment banker.
Although the case has not yet been brought to an end, public opinion has quickly appeared on a few occasions in social media, criticising it for its behaviour and way of thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of the book about Paddington were afraid that readers would not feel bound by the exciting mission
The author’s daughter, Michaela Bonda, and Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm embrace of the book, says of the list: “It’s hard to place the person who read it for the first time, even before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She claims that her father, who had inspired her to write a book for the children before a small plus, was convinced that her work would be rejected. She also added that after her death in the last 60th year, the book release seems to be "sleep-skin."
Regarding Paddington, who describes as “a very important member of our family,” she says that her father was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't panic," he adds.
“ However, since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something — you feel proud of him, even though it wasn’t your job.
I think Paddington's success is more than that.
Although he thought and created himself, he always earned Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to call her.
Her daughter was transferred to the Louis Pasteura 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He called on me regularly and said it's really bad that he's probably not going to come out of it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say that Natasha will die within two minutes, and I have to confess to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors who gave it to her to maintain her heart rate stopped acting and were released from the body.
She died some time ago, and that was the end of everything.
I could just sit and wait to know it's all going to work out.
I couldn't go out or cry or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to hold on."
At the end of Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already complained about the loss of her daughter, entered the camp with other passengers unknown to her.
"No one knew," she said.
I had a broken head, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but in the plane, I felt a great compassion for Nada.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's e-mails in pain are helping to prevent suicide at home
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are trying to lead others away from the purpose of life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are located in the City of Welsh with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can get help.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he was diagnosed with depression.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," he says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a well-informed cook with a terrible smile.
"All knew his dreams.
They always said he could explain every room to him."
Before his death, however, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place. ”
In 2014, Brother Tyler was 11 years old and he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the effect of the domain."
Sharon Davis created a map, “to tell people that there are people who can turn to and talk to, even if we know it.
Don't sit still, talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, recently lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner.
"He didn't say that he felt bad or sad or something," he says.
“Some days before the birth of God, we noticed a change in his behavior.
The Holy One was already in full position. When the children opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to reason with him: “It is a family crisis.
He's gonna blow us up.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh will take place in July, because the FBI will launch an investigation
"I thought that if we were really able to get what he asked for — a time-limited investigation and a limited approach — we could achieve some consensus," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Commission would "distribute" on the opposite sides of the attack.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his republican volunteers want the FBI to come?
It's been a while since they're gone.
The elections to the Congress have already been held for a few weeks — November 6th, and if, according to the estimates, the Republic has lost them, the possibility of choosing a particular person to the highest court in the country is significantly reduced.
George W. Bush has already raised an audience to call the senators and urge them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
There is no doubt that Brett Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes from senators, which would allow Vice President Mike's Pence to break his impassion and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under the regimes of Kima, the number of refugees from North Korea is small
According to the words of South Korean Lawyer Kim Dzong And, seven years ago, he took power, the number of people running from North Korea to South Korea fell.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of the Union, Park Byeong-seug said 1127 flights were recorded last year, and in 2011 to 2706.
According to it, the key factors that have affected this situation are more precise controls on the border between North Korea and China and higher rates collected by human industries.
Pjongjang didn't make this public statement.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally proposed for South Korea.
According to the authorities in Seoul, since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the border has been illegally extended to over 30,000 Koreans from the North.
Most of China's refugees, which have the longest border with North Korea, make it easier to cross it than the strictly protected zone of demilitarized (DMZ) between Korea and Korea.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to the country.
The relations between the North and the South, which theoretically are still in war, have been clearly improved in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pjongjang, where they held talks on the negotiations on denuclearization that had previously taken place at a dead spot.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donalda Trumpa, with Kim Dzong Unem, who took place in June in Singapore. The result is a general agreement on the duty to clean up the Korean South from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of the lack of progress in this matter.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no doubt about our national security, and in these circumstances there will be no opportunity for us to develop ourselves as the first ones," Ri said in a speech he made before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh "historic" and says he does not hope to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the Election of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court of Great Britain “historic” and said that he does not, of course, hope to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made that statement during the announcement he made on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted in this way, she would be recognized as a 'historic'," said Pelosi about her reaction to the statement made by Kavanaugh on Thursday before the Commission of the Senate of Justice.
Kavanaugh was emotionally opposed by the accusation of sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both adults.
During his first speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — he almost cried and lost his voice when he spoke about family and medical issues.
He also clearly defeated the Commission's Democrats, setting out the strict terms of the "great and coordinated closure" organised by liberals, who claimed that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that according to her report, Kavanaugh showed that he did not hope to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he made himself disqualified by giving these statements, as well as by the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," she said.
The question was whether he would attempt to withdraw Kavanaugh from the office if he received his nomination and if the Democrats obtained a majority in the Election of Representatives, Pelosi was involved.
"I say so: if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also be in the court where he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the district court of appeal in the Columbia District.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about the possible decisions made by Kavanaugh regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe Process, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the trial, Kavanaugh asked whether some of the Supreme Court's decisions would be inconceivable.
"It's not time to enter the historic court, the warned person, who will expect us to say 'as it is wonderful'," added Pelosi.
And women have to rule her.
It's a fair diaphragm, a month and years when the fur is exploding, and she can't throw it out without pay.
"We'll cry when we're out," Gloria said to me 45 years later.
"It's probably quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “It was a great help to me by a woman who was the manager of a company, who said that she was also crying when she was upset, but she imagined that when she was upset and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to ‘ You must think I’m sad because I’m paying.
I'm tired.
He's still doing his job.
I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed to be heard by the wrath partly because they are in principle misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first crews in the office where he was shot by a man is how I once began to cry out in an unquenchable rage.
"Never let them see how you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're crazy.
They think you're sad, and they're happy that they touched you."
Patricia Schroeder from the Democratic Party, who was then a member of the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a knife on a boat named Monkey Business and dropped out of the river, she was shocked to the border of Patricia that she could actually consider the idea of a personal application to the president.
"It wasn't a decision," she said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was next.
Someone identified this situation as "The Royal Snow and the Seven Splendors."
As the campaign lasted a long time, Schroeder was busy collecting funds and promised he wouldn't be able to get in if he didn't get $2 million.
It was being punished for losing.
Then she discovered that some of her men, who gave her $1,000, had only 250.
"Do they think I have any cuts?" she wondered.
During the talk she announced that she would not be conducting a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions — thanks to those who supported her, frustrations for the system that made it so hard to get money and return to the voters, not delegates, and the excitement at sexism — that the voice tied her up in the throat.
"You might think I've gone through nerve damage," she recalls the dust reactions.
"You might think Klenex is encouraging me.
I remember thinking about what they're writing on my cover.
'Did she cry?'
What benefits can bring to Beijing's war economy between the United States and China
The peace that began the war between the United States and China was widespread and, although there is still a lasting battle, the conflict between these countries can be useful to Beijing, says experts.
The first warning was issued this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, setting up a table for key export goods in China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important scaling took place this week following the introduction of new customs rates on goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion dollars), which resulted in the taxing of half of all goods entering the USA from China.
Each time Pekin was involved in nature, raising the last price for US goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to each United States attack and does not seem to have a second economy in the world to step up soon.
The motivation of Washington to withdraw is to accept requests, but the public surrender to the United States would be too disturbing for the President of China, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Pekin's cards were good, the pressure resulting from the US trade war could in the long term strengthen China, reducing its dependence on both economies.
"The fact that the rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic chaos in some countries is, in fact, much more dangerous than observers have been given," said Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Syria is "ready" for return to refugees
The court claims that Syria is ready for voluntary return of refugees, and asks for assistance in rebuilding a country that has been damaged by the war in more than seven years.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moualam, said that conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation on our territory is now more stable and secure thanks to the efforts to combat terrorism," he said.
As a result of a return to normality, the government is building up areas that have been destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions have already been fulfilled so that refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and individual economic savings in their daily lives and maintenance measures could voluntarily return to it.
According to UN estimates since the beginning of the war in 2011, Syria has left over 5.5 million inhabitants.
The next six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the country that was destroyed.
However, he stressed that he would not accept assistance from the protected conditions or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe promotes victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European company won Ryder Cup 2018, making the US team 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in Paris.
In Europe, the United States has already lost six times since 1993 and has not been able to win Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe recovered the trophies when Thomas Bjorn, under the leadership of the Danish captain, received 14,5 points that were needed for the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who through most of the tournaments did not go well, found a ball from the base just to the water at the 16th floor of PAR3, leaving the same game as Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfist Molinari has gone through all the rounds and has been one of the four players since 1979, when the first time this tournament took place in the current format, it has been able to win the score of 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was awarded the result of the lowest 57-4 ranked in the game chain from Europe, Thorbjorna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the highest position in the world's chain, has lost two columns before the last column of England with Jan Poulter, which may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The biggest European winner in Ryder Cup was Hispan Sergio Garcia, who has already participated in eight such tournaments and won 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t pay, but today I can’t stop.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so glad I'm getting the gun back.
That's the success of the entire team and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia, after winning the team from Europe.
He's sending his cousin John Rahmo's palace, which he played on Sunday in a single American golf league game, Tiger Woods, resulting in 2&1.
"I feel a great pride from the winner of Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has 13-21-3 results in Ryder Cup.
It's unsatisfying statistics like one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 of the most important titles and was just Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. company had problems with finding the current, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tour.
“ I am proud of the boys who fought, ” said his American captain, Jim Furyk, after a shocking appearance.
At some point, we pressed a few Europeans this morning.
We broke up.
Headphones in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find ways to look forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of revenge for opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
