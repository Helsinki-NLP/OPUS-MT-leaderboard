I'm here.
We all want to come with you.

Wait a minute.

He'd have made it, he'd've just tried.
It's a very small book.
I'm going there with the plane.
He waited for my answer.

Tom's alone in his car.
How long do I have to be here?
I promised you I'd be free of charge in my own time.
Maria's in the library.
We'll find the movie.
Where's the bottler?
If Tom loves Mary and Mari loves John, does Tom love John?
I don't want to destroy anything.
We think it's time to laugh closer.
I trust what Tom said.
I saw them in my mouth.
Where's my blue luck?

Just slow down.
Tom claims he shot Mary to protect himself.
I agree.
I was looking for the right words.
Get out!
Tom doesn't know his strength.
The water is watery.
It's not life.
What were you thinking?
He wants to make a song.
It's a mess.
We think it's time to laugh more.
Tom made it quite clear.
Tom's dangerous, isn't he?
I'm going to get out of here.
The sooner we start, the sooner we're done.
They're my friends.
Looks like Tom's asleep.
You don't get up enough.
I think it's the other way to investigate how he feels and thinks.
I'm talking a lot.
Why didn't you eat your chocolate?
The doctor used the X-ray to study my brain.
A seating in such an office without such an office is a real punishment.

You're on the wrong track.
Stay home.
Tom died in 2009.
All people are born as free and equal in dignity and justice. They have been given wisdom and conscience and their attitude to one another must have the spirit of a brother.
Everyone hates me.
I'll do it, you can calm down and hope for me.
It's my own boat under the tree.
She's gonna get a good husband.

Take it for yourself.
He's a family black man.
I've never told anyone about it.
Please free maps without any treatment.
You asked for my help.
Does Tom believe me?
Is Tom a good guy or a good guy?
Even though it was a hundred, I went out.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's over!

Something's happened, right?
I can't decide whether I'm happy or sad.

I have to go now.
Tom didn't come home.
That's a difficult question.

Will you give me time?
A month did not bring the rain, so they had to dig a hole.
You're still paying for it.
Why did you act like a child?
How'd you go?
It's not the same anymore.
I'm afraid of earthquakes.
At some point, it's getting worse.
I don't need your love.
I'm so sorry about what I said.
For what?
Why are you here today?
Of course!
Was that all you saw?
It was where Tom died.

Are you coming?
Do you remember who I am?
I'd like to be away from you.
Are you crazy?
You can take it with you.
Wait a minute.
Tom's high in his food.
I want you to drink.
How is that even possible?
Where are you using it?
No one noticed me.
I'm waiting for you.
Who believes that?
Just talk to Tommy.
How are you all going?
We can do it later.
Looks like no one's been paying attention to what he said.

I live in Qatar.
I didn't think you'd show up.
Tom told me Mary's on the diet.
Where's the story?
Why not?
They look like they're hard to distinguish.
Tom had been waiting for something very different.
I knew him right away.
Can I talk to you alone?
Life is never easy.
You're crazy.
I speak Chinese, but I can't read it.
Why would Tom want to do something like that?

I hope it's gone.
I'm from Estonia.
Good mother's day!
He's my sister.
Your share is $220.
Am I crazy?
Tom's paying.
Are you going to hurt me?
Take me back.
I was wrong.
I don't have to go. I want to go.
The post office is closed.
Tom's thirty.
They have no choice at all.
My mother's angry.
I like astronomy.
Others, did you find the ice cream you once said you were lost?
It's a different thing.
The players have big legs.
Did Tom really kill himself?
A beautiful girl is in bed.
He probably can't hear.
They went on.
I'm eating a lot of meat.
Little's the red one.
He'd be almost dead.
It's too loud!
Tom's not a very good car driver.
It would have been better if you hadn't come today.
His proposal is not particularly important.
Check, please.
No, it can't be!
He thought he was coming to see her.
My wife's pregnant.
I'm writing a book.
Stop, please.
Hold on!
I got to be his friend.
Tom was obviously lying.
I'm gonna fuck this hole.
Am I not beautiful?
You're on the list.
He forgot his wife's birthday.
Tom came a little closer.
I cut the potatoes in the roots.
I don't care about you here.
I'm very happy right now.
I'm a man.
Tom's looking for work.
Where's the library?
The group tried to solve social problems.
I'm here!
It's very effective.
I think we should go back.
Stay home.
Did you know that?
Tom came from the door.
Tom's not going to school with a bus.
Uh-huh.
It's more obvious.
We need to keep the meeting going.
Do you have oil?
Tom's not good at this, though.
Tom wants to see you as soon as possible.
It's not worth it!
Tom's longer than me.
I went through a new one a week.
I still have much to learn.
I know what's going on.
I was just driving to Boston to make Tom's birthday party.
Everyone's gonna be okay.
Their lungs are tomorrow.
It's an American writer.
I'll give you a good advice.
I'd like to try.
You have a message.

The next time you hear me, please be careful.
Sorry, it's not your decision.
I bought it for my daughter.
Is your mother home?
The investigation is going on.
I like your language.
All of them!
Tom's a poor man.
I would never do that to Tom.
Please hurry, I don't have all night.
You see everything in black.
Hey, John, how are you?
Don't write the word "borch" and "capsassup" in German!
Listen.
It won't be long.
I've often learned music.
Whoever's looking for it will find it.
Don't just stand there and help me clean it up!
You and Tom must be happy.
Hello.
I went to the shower before breakfast.
I'm a woman.
They were angry.
I'm a hero.
That's a lot easier.
We're going to London.
I like to do more than coffee.
I have three cameras.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
Have I not suffered enough yet?
It's real life.
Eat until she's hot.
I just have to wear it.
As I can see, you were the last one to see Tom.
Here's the address.
Tom was really wrong.
Tom respects your opinion.
We have what we've served.
We're gonna have to sleep last night.
We should talk about it.
Are you going to buy a dictionary?
Here's what you're asking.
This house is too small.
I don't have anything to do with it.
Carp was full of land.
Yeah.
I'm an American singer.
Let's go.
Are you crazy?

I want to go.
I really want to see her.
We're going to a date.
Do you have two free rides?
3 December is the day of the International Year of Human Rights.
Are you in trouble?
No one's been up all the time.
Tom hates school.
He's sitting on the bench.
She's got three daughters.
Eight feet of Paul was right.
The woman's running water.
There are many pictures in this book.
A mental event can lead to a great outcome.
You gave yourself the best.
In Hungary, I have a friend named Borat.
I'm a dog.
How long have you been together?
I just wanted to know if you're in trouble.
Where's the book?
Everybody looks tired.
It's a normal attitude here.
I'd like to borrow about three thousand dollars.
Who are you?
He ran away.
It doesn't seem to be a crime.
Looks like the money's been stolen.
The books are on the table.
I'll meet him once a week.
Tom's gonna shoot me if he knows I told you about it.
Aptsih!
It's not crazy.
It's not a dog.
It's my third week.
The gold industry is much more valuable than it was thought.
The Italian language is my mother.

It smells good here.
We know it now.
I'd better call Tom again.
Do you have a dictionary?
When's Tom coming?
Have you heard of the earthquake last night?
Is Tom aware of what Mary did?
Things don't always go the way we plan.
What are you doing here?
Please take care of the children.
Can you do that?
I read that book.
Where's the hotel?
Do you have fresh land?
Learn to read.
The eye is blind, the toothbrush against the neck.
Tom's working now.
What do you think when we meet tomorrow at 2:3 to eat lunch?
Thank you!
My mom wants me to study in Switzerland.
I'm a tree.
Should this letter be written in English?
Did he like you?
What's your name?
Where do you live?
Stand by, Tom.
Did you all go crazy?
Has Tom talked to you about me?
The glass is empty.
Have you got your water?
It's a great idea for Baudelaire.
Who wrote them?
I didn't know what to tell her.
Tom tried to protect me.
He's been in France three times.
How often do the buses go?
You're not local.
I'll see you tomorrow.
My name is Roberto.
Is that enough?
What I liked most about filming was the last stage.
I'm a college student.
You should say what you're thinking.
Be quiet.
The house's all doors are closed.
Tom couldn't find his way into the salt.
Good dreams!
We work day and night we rest.
Littlefoot's close here.
It's completely logical.
I'll do it without problems.
The solution is wrong.
They didn't know.
I'm a eleven-year-old.
Get your hands off me.
Hello, everyone!
The kids are the kids of our lives.
Tom got up on the floor.
You're a beautiful girl.
Hello!
Do you like learning?
My name is Hopkins.
Tom told Mari that she was pregnant.
Is there something new?
The kids are going to go.
Of course not!
He likes to read the books.
That's when I started being confused.
What did you give him?
I have to go now.
Feel at home.
Get the kid to sleep.
Ask me anything!
I got two cars.
Please fill in the request.
Where's Tom today?
The dog's nose is very sensitive.
Would you tell Tom that I was standing by?
The land is cold.
This house exists.
Thank you so much!
John doesn't know what to do.
Where's your friend?
I have two brothers.
I better go and talk to Tom.
We can't afford anything.
The leaves are falling.
Tom heard about our conversation.
It's my mail address.
He's a beautiful woman.
Tom didn't understand why Mary had made such a decision.
It's not the only thing I have to do.
Dead?
Come on, Tom, it's fun!
From year to year.
What's Tom doing lately?
I'm learning English.
Hi, Tom.
Where are the kids?
There are no bugs in the game.
I just opened the door.
Children like trees.
I'm working with Tom myself.
Tom and I were married in May.
What?
The Messilians are flying to the baby.
How was the French language?
It's not about the world I could say I'm from there.
Happy birthday, Muriel!
Tom would help us if he could.
My phone number is 9876-5432.
My name is Ricardo.
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.
Is that a lie?
Heather's going to school at eight.
You've really served it.
Do it somewhere else.
What are we gonna eat tonight?
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
Mr. Johnson's house is outside my house.
Tom was the best dreamer here.
Tom went to school in the middle of the game.
I agree.
Sokis are getting sick.
It's only three months after October.
It's a very important message.
I'm alive.
Wait a minute.
He was talking fast.
Can you get me on the screen?
How hungry are you?
This building will be confined to the city.
He'll be a good doctor.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No one wants to fight.
I don't like her face.
Go on.
You went to third grade, didn't you?
Now, I'm tired.
Calm down!
The rings are red.
Do you speak English?
I want to go home faster.
Light and wood are falling.
The white box is under the tree.
Better start now.
Tom wants a box.
Brazil is the largest country in South America.
Go back to work.
We don't forget.
Tom broke the walls of the north.
It's Sunday.
Of course.
I'm trying to find him for you.
I'll give Tom a message.
I love chicken.
There's a lot of good things to do with being beautiful.
Please don't interrupt.
What do I get out of the bag?
The car's ready.
He's a good student.
It's too hard.
Were there others with you?
Tom wants to borrow some money.
Dad's a good man.
Is anyone expecting me?
Tom's crying.
I sing.
I want a piece of food.
It's all there.
I can understand the language of the trumpet.
His behavior is not socially acceptable.
What's going on?
Can you drive with a horse?
I'd like to go faster.
I lived like a penguin.
I'm thinking.
You two have to get out of here.
The house is cold.
I'm very happy that this song has so many translations already.
Doesn't that sound strange to you?
Rong's gonna have to go out nine.
This sweater pays over $50.
He's serious about it.
All right, all right.
I got to start with a totally incredible mistake.
Tom's hands are broken.
Obviously.
How do you and Tom get through?
I didn't have a lot of choice.
What did you think?
Did you have to share the bedroom with your sister-in-laws?
You're very kind.
I forgot to tell Tom.
I built a new house.
What's your favorite football team?
It's a beautiful dress.
Just follow your heart.
Tom's real.
I'll be right there.
Listen carefully.
England has requested a replacement with the President.
Good morning!
I've got a silver count.
I'm afraid of height.
I want a Russian book.
Omit!
Keep working harder.
I'm nervous.
Tom wrote something to look at.
Can I pay with the card?
Tom's too proud to have people tell him what he needs to do.
There's no rails here.
Oi!
It's a big one.
Good International Women's Day!
Mari's in the prince's office.
Who made this picture?
Do you live in support?
It sounds like Hollywood.
It's over!
He won the lottery.
Happy birthday!
I'll go get some coffee.
I'm home.
I saw a cheeseburger.
What are you doing tomorrow?
The Messilians are social residents.
Where were they?
I'll stay with you.
He's on his way.
Tell me what to do.
I'm glad to see you.
He couldn't understand me.
I wrote him a letter of love.
Taxi's waiting.
I see you're really excited.
Don't tell anyone about it.
He's not a long grower, but he's strong.
My father is stronger than your father.
Please close the window.
He's wearing a ring.
Tom's doing his bed once.
Tom looks like he's in the shower.
I have blue eyes.
How did you get your name?
You ran the engine.
I was a teacher.
My father is stronger than your father.
I'll never find true love.
Tom's got a better hand with his uncle Mary.
Jim's opening the door.
This camera is mine.
Put the door shut.
Tom's growing up in his own mind.
What do you want?
Africa is a people's grave.
Tom's the one with the car.
Get out!
I went to Boston with a gun.
Appi!
They're watching.
What's wrong with you?
I want some rest.
Call me.
It's one of the world's largest cities.
I'm not from Boston.
It's full of bones in the kitchen.
We're really behind.
Tom just talked to Mary.
Hold on!
I've got a big prayer.
Are you ready to go?
This has happened before.
I'm very shy.
Welcome to your father for me.
"I'm running the class right away," I thought.
That's not a hard question.
It's a secret, I can't tell you.
They'll be here tonight.
We're all going to die.
Tom wants you to borrow some money.
The boys are weird sometimes.
His statement was far from true.
Tom failed twice.
I live too far.
Tom's learning to help people.
I've got two oranges.
Tom is the only one who can speak French.
Tom did his homework on his own.
Do you like this plan?
Tommy's sick is blind, he's afraid of height and he's allergic to the spiders, I don't think he's gonna live without Tomita.
Focus on your job.
I spent some time working with the Venetsuela accent.
Good night to everyone!
It's easy to say.
I'll tell you something.
It's your problem.
Tom, tell me the truth, 'cause I can get to know that.
It's not that long list.
I've tried to get over my recovery, but it's over.
I've got trees.
I can't find Tom.
I won't keep you back.
I want to be with you.
Oot!
I'll do it next time.
They're going.
Good morning, dreamy.
Everyone wants to see you.
Come with me.
Tom doesn't like how Mary laughs.
Not all Brazilians don't enjoy chicken.
I wish I'd be away from you.
More than that!
I can't thank you for that.
What do you have to go to bed?
Tom lied to his mother's signature.
Don't you know what it is?
We all live together.
"I am" is easy to translate into any language.
He's moving.
It's my computer.
Heather's a nice girl.
Leedu is a member of the European Union.

It made me sleep.

You've got a fever.
This book is about transparency.
Tom, I'll never leave you.

What do you want?
Tom was too late.
Between the walls, it's raining over the river.
I don't need a bed.
What's your mother's name?
How could I trust you?
I'm not afraid of cold, but I don't want heat.
You don't have a basis for your criticism.
Are we eating out today?

Good morning!
I looked at the TV instead of learning.
I'm talking to Tom about it.
Can you shut the door?
I think we should call the police.
What are your thoughts?
Hey, don't push me into this.
I'm afraid that might hurt Tom.
I decided to go there.
Many of my friends came from my childhood too.
You're going down.
Ooh!
It is clear that no one has any new proposals.
Do you eat rice every day?
I don't like your proposal.
Who's Emily?
Maybe I'll see you later.
Whose friend is he?
