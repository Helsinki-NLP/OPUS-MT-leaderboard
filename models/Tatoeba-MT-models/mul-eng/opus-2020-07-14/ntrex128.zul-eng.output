Welsh AMs are worried that they're going to ‘see as monsters’
They asked themselves, among the AMs, about the idea of changing the so-called MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is being removed from the programs for the change in the call for participation of the Welsh Parliament.
The Ams of all political parties have the impression that this calls for them to be ridiculed.
Another aspect of the labyrinth AM is that they were afraid because there is the same volume as Twp and Pwp.
For foreign students of Wales: According to the Welsh, twp says a farm and pwp says another.
The Plaid AM is spoken of as a group of happy people who have given other names to which they are not chosen.
About the Welsh Conservative, it was a group that agreed to accept a change of name but noted that the MWP was very close to the so - called explosive.
Both Welsh and W are also called U in Yorkshire England.
This meeting is the only one that rejects the amendment of the name: "The decisive decision by reading this statement of the members of the board will be that of the members of the board of directors."
The law of the Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh organization the power to change their name.
In June the Communists published the results of public violence on the streets, which had received a great deal of support for the burning of a Welsh national organization.
In the case of AMs, the network has established a WMP and the public opinion has expressed its reliance on MWP.
The Ams put their views in place, but this debate will be a problem for Elin Jones, who should not have been involved in the violation of the laws of change in the weeks to come.
The laws to be rejected will involve changes in the way the community works, including the rules for AM correction and the procedure.
The AMs will have the last word in the matter that you will be called when you are discussed by law.
The Macedonians are chosen to vote for the change in the name of their country.
The voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether they will change the name of their country into the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
This open vote appears after trying to resolve a ten-year-old limit on the case of a country near Greece whose country has a Macedonian name.

The president of Macedonia, George Ivanov against the change in the name of the vote, will reject the vote.
However, following the change in the name of General Zoran Zaev, they see this as something to be done in order to become EU and NATO members.
It covers the town of Bells of st Martins with the difficulty of meeting congregations in Harlem.
"In history, the older men with whom I witnessed said there was a week and place of worship in all the stadiums," said Mr. Adams.

The University of Michigan writer Tiffany Ng said that it was the first time in the world that the sword was hit by black singer Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play at Riverside Church 18 years ago.

What happened a few months ago in St. Martins was the cause of corruption and corruption, some of whom were brought to the attention of other congregation leaders were brought to the diocese.
The non-members of the congregation should write a list of the delegates with a letter that they do not want to bear the cost of taxes and charges for being as a viceroy in the maintenance of their contiguous and construction.
Some members of the congregation weep bitterly for the apparent failure of the diocese.

Lieutenant Goldsmith told the telegraph about the week "Cromwell is greatly praised, perhaps there is something in which to celebrate.

The rest of the Chinese Rosa will bring powerful waters in the south-west U.S.
According to the weather forecast, Agent Rosa will lose her energy if we get into the cool water in the southern part of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring it.
Rosa has a glass of 85 mph, each wind, since 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to look north on Sunday.
At present, the summit begins to change the situation in the Pacific Ocean and looks east to the west of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the island of Baja California in the Middle East, the storm will begin to rise rapidly in the northwestern parts of the U.S.
Rosa will bring a rain of ten inches in some places in Mexico in the Middle East.
Therefore, in the next days, the rains will meet with the clouds, and the winds will blow, and the winds will blow against the western parts of the earth.
In nearby areas, the rain mentioned in the inch will only create dangerous torrents, dot worship, and even the destruction of desert land.
The tropics will make the rain level from two to three inches per hour, especially in the southern regions of Nevada and Arizona.
The rain forests can be two to two inches long inland, mostly in Arizona.
Stairling streams are carefully controlled by a rapid deterioration of the natural water supply.
It may be foolish to open up a business that has actually become sick because the rain is coming.
Powerful rainwaters can cause the clouds to become raindrops that looked like years ago when the wind caused the wind to blow in nearby places to go with the dust.
The coming waves will bring powerful rain in areas close to South California and south.
Waters that are calculated on the inside can cause small damage to the wood and roads

In the next days, a noticeable form of heat will try to build a track again.
Between the U.S. and the East, the early appearance of October and the temperature of 80s is expected from the south to the north.
in New York City it is expected to reach 80 degrees second and that it will be more than 10 degrees normally.
our natural researchers have done this to show that levels will rise in the east.

"Do you think you're telling the truth before the world?
He was told, "You have power if most women are weak."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the cheese was closed, he said he had much to say in front of the court.
Using cables the stations have spread the side , where time has come for the juji to vote for Kavanaugh's release.
But Flake will do that only if she realizes that the FBI is looking at all aspects of the story next week, what has already been demanded by many.
Flake has changed his mind while talking to his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After talking to Coonswhe and the parliament, Flake made a decision.
Flake's Choice had been at the Flake's decision in force, because the citizens did not vote Kavanaugh without the completion of the investigation.

The only article that invited Livingston to play 1-0 with Rangers
The first article of Dolly Mega conquered Livingston
In Livington, recently promoted by Steven Gerrard's Ranger that he accepted his second divorce after 18 games as an Ibrox team trainer.
Menga’s article was different as Gary Holt’s group grew up, and the hibernian lived in second place.
Gerrard’s team won the championship in the race and will meet Hearts in the race, leaving them with eight points of conclusion.
Earlier, Rangers had received Rapid Vienna in Europe League in fourth.
Livingston is now no longer divided into six games, as the coach Holt has continued to be separated since he shut down Kenny Miller’s voice a month ago.
Livingston is an opportunity to shop when you are in contact with guests
The Holt team was so advanced before they were grown, their understanding caused many problems with Rangers.
Scott Robinson had a chance but failed to write an article about it, so Allan Lithgow passed Craig Halkett by the head of the store.
The family had grown up to throw Ranger play in front of them, because they knew they could break up with the set pieces.
And it was the way the fruit that grew up.
Rangers made a free-kick in Livingston found that he could open the garden, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined Menga, and the ball was placed in the middle of the box.
At that time, Rangers was playing but not too late for the drama and Liam Kelly was standing by,
The petition continues in the second round, or Alfredo Moralose, who is commonly known as Kelly wearing a ball.
UScott Pitttman is protected by the legs and legs of Rangers by Allan McGregor and Lithgow left the ball in another game of Livingston.
Crosses that follow the Livingston box but are removed, there are the wonders of the penath – then Halket badly defeats Glenn Middleton, and the boat is completely removed.
'Good' by Livingston-Editor
Alessadair Lamont on BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
The game is a draw and a draw from Livingston.
Only one person, having a good voice, will continue to pass over what was expected as they continue to rise.
Their own way of playing and their identity has not changed since they returned to the camp, but we must commend Holt as he did the group to come.
You have many responsibilities.
Captain Halkett is outstanding, his appreciation is strong, while Menga, who kept Conn or Goldon and Joe Worroll all the games.
The Rangers are strong, but.

Thousands of bishops who are not accompanying Erdogan-- most of them are Kurdish- and want their words to be heard, violating Erdogan's law and the German government now accept to the country.
The report highlights a distinction between the views of a seemingly foreign visitor on German Turks and how they are opposed to others.

In some parts of the desert in the South West, the Rockies community and the Great Basin are expected to have a 1 to 2 inch [1 to 2, so that they can be measured at 4 cm] if possible.
With the dangers of these surges, Rosa is a wonderful blessing as part of her battle against corruption.

Hundreds of people were trapped in a cave in the city of Palu on Friday when the gases rose at 18 feet [18 m] in an hour of a storm, killing many of them in their deaths and destroying anything on the way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of seven feet [7.5 m].
"When the tsunami threat comes out on Wednesday, people would do their jobs in private and they would not rush and be victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, who spoke against Indonesia, in an attack on BNPB.
"The tsunami wasn't on its own, drove cars, boats, houses, and drove everything to the ground," said Nugroho, adding that tsunamis had hit the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before flying around the world.
Some of them fled to the villages of Tsunami, which said.
Some 17,700 people were transferred to 24 stations in Palu.
The photos taken from the disaster center showed many buildings and shops, balsams, and mud slides and a water - conditioned shower.
Efforts have continued to push the city into the corner all the way to the end.
The earthquake was known in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) says that the magnitude of the nuclear power generated on Friday was 200 per cent of the nuclear bomb that hit Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, sitting at the end of a long, small part, may grow to the size of the tsunami, saying.
Nugroho described such damage as "big" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops, and hotels were sold.
Other victims are found lying under the roof of broken buildings, saying, adding 540 people to their deaths by 29 people.
Nugroho is home to those who suffer and damage, possibly a distance of 300 miles north of Palu, a place called Donggar, near the quake epicenter.

The earthquake and tsunami caused the end of the energy and communication in Paul that made it difficult for managers to direct their efforts to help.

When workers from the World Vision have settled in a safe area in Palu, where workers live in shelters built at their office, they carry drugs on the way, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief teams began to launch relief teams, some complained that foreign workers with extensive knowledge were forbidden to go to Paul.
According to Indonesia’s guidelines, funds, goods and personnel from the past can begin to fall if the disaster is said to be a global disaster.
That is impossible.
"Only the disaster of the country," says Aulia Ariani, who speaks Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government said, "Well, this is a global disaster," we wouldn't allow assistance coming out of other countries but now it's impossible."
As two nights pass into Palu after the earthquake of the fifth century and tsunamis, friends and family of those still living hoped that lovers would be a miracle to alleviate natural disasters.

One West: he changed his name to Ye.
Lake Kanye West has changed his name--that's Yes.
Advertised a change in Twitter by the Conclusion, he wrote: "You are known as One."
West, 41 years old, was a term of terror for some time and used the monarch as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before her appearance at night's end, when she was expected to start her new Yandhi album.
Put the singer Ariana Grande in the exhibition that has highlighted "for reasons relating to his spirit," said the founder of the program.
While it is an achievement of his current professional reputation, West says that this name has a religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'he' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West at the beginning of the year, referring to his album and radio title Big Boy.
"I am you, and I am him, and we are.
It came from Caine, which means that he alone, only to show what is good, what is bad, what is bad, what is bad, what is bad, what is bad, what is bad.

Mexican MLOs don't want to use war against citizens
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised that he will not use a military force against civilians as this country nears 50 years of blood attack against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised in Tlateolco Plaza that "you will never use soldiers to oppress Mexicans."
The police were involved in a peaceful exhibition on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at the time when the campaign of Latvian students focused on Latin America as a whole.
Lopez Obrador promises to support young Mexicans by providing public assistance to those who read and open many public texts in writing.
He says that unemployment and lack of opportunities to learn lead young people to the problems of crime.
The U.S. must support A.I.
As China works more in the I.A., the U.S. should double the number used for research in the field, says the founder and AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Expressions from behind the various parts of the U.S. government have made a statement to AI, as the U.S. general does not have an AI.
During that time, China began its program last year: intended to draw 1.1 to AI in 2030.
"The cost of AI research will be a good start, because all other countries are too far behind the U.S., and we want the next success to AI," Lee said.
Controversy and financial support can be repeated since the major AI performance in the U.S., Lee invited the CNBC to discuss this week.
Lee, his book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director of the Innovation Ventures, who grew up in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University worked on the new AI program of the American Othello player, and later became the director of the Microsoft Research and Director of the Google branch of China
Lee agreed to the U.S. professional competition in advance, such as the Robotics Challenge Highway, and asked if the next one would be, to help see the following industries.
U.S. researchers should often work hard to overcome government supplies, says Lee.
"There's no China that's driving educational leaders; they're companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies use version-based lighting to work on AI years later.
Lee said that the transition goals can also help the U.S. to strengthen their AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically performed on PhD in AI," he says.
The China Council of China issued a report on the development of the next Generation Intelligence Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
China National Natural Science Foundation spends money on people at educational institutions such as the Natura Science Foundation and other sources of money to researchers, but the textbook for teaching is small in China, says Lee.
In the beginning of the year, the Defence Department was the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which has to be associated with the management of the field and the teaching, and also the White House announced the construction of a special section of the Artificial Intelligence.
This month the DARPA represents $2 billion in the AI Next program.
NSF, has grown to over $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, the American Law on the Construction of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence will no longer exist.
Macedonians vote for whether they have changed the name of the world.
The Macedonians voted on Sunday that they rejected the name of the country as "Republic of North Macedonia," a campaign that would resolve the conflict with Greece on the basis of the European Union and NATO's integrity.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its country, goes on to say that their neighbors in the north of their way want their place and want to enter NATO and the EU.
Both governments agree on the terms referred to, but some say that changing the term means observing the customs of most Macedonians of the Slavic
President Gjerge Ivanov said that he would not vote and that the vote rate would give the impression that 50 percent of the people would come to the council by law.
The question on the vote paper reads: "You agree with NATO and the EU on the Greek agreement."
In agreement with the change of name, Count Zoran Zaev, says that the most taxable thing you are currently paying is the EU-Nato trees in Macedonia, some countries that have experienced the collapse of Yugoslavia
"I have come here to vote for our country, so that young Macedonians will live well under the European Union's umbrella because it describes our entire health," says Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Regardless of the legal situation, the majority of parliaments decide to vote.
The change will require two - thirds to eat at a district convention.
The World Voting Commission says there are no reports of non-compliance for 1 p.m.
Yet, it is still 16 percent, some 34 percent of the previous Polish vote in 2016, while 66 percent of the voters put their votes.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the city, Skopje.
Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, Zorica's wife and his son, Dushko, voted for a referendum in Macedonia by changing the name of a country that will open up how to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
In Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, corrected the flag and brought the seats before the courts by those who would oppose the referendum.
"We don't have NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads, not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a reputation.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonians, we can convert others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to the necessary growth in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that 80 percent of our citizens will cry with the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He says "yes" the results "the certainty of our future."
The Polish press published in Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research says between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters are involved – under expectations.
Another poll, commissioned by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 per cent of respondents who arranged to vote on Sunday.
To that end, 70 percent say your vote.
In order to make the Ephraimites welcome me 50 percent and one vote.
A lack of pherendum will present a major problem of the pro-Western government this took a long time on May one year.
COVER: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City to the town of Brighton to be healed
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the bridge of Brighton at Manchester City's victory on 2-0 win at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy for her 65 - minute article.
Argentine’s player was hit in the back in the back when he started planning.
You were among the three defenders of Brighton, before the trial was over.
Aguero finds its surroundings around four green boats.
He pushes another prisoner before passing another batch to the Brighton box.
Then he cried out to the right, finding Sterling.
The forwarding song directly affects the ball in the box to return it back to Aguero, using his right arm to win the Bridgethon's Mathew Ryan with an article on the left of the net.
"Aguero still faces problems at his feet," the city administrator Pep Guardian told reporters.
"We talked to him about 55 minutes, or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
And we are glad, when we are with him, because at the time he was taken away from us.
But it's Sterling that gives Sky Blues a chance at the beginning of the Premiere League competition.
The gorilla disappeared in 29 seconds.
Aguero finds a ball in the band of Brighton players in that game.
Send a nice ball in the left hand to Leroy Sane.
Sane says to touch it before you listen to Sterling in the palace.
Sky Blues players touched the ball and entered the engine almost went out.

Scherzer wants to play the spooky player. And Rockies
The National Group has been expelled from the playoff competition, and there is no reason to press another start.
But Scherzer, who is trying to challenge himself, wishes to enter the Sunday court against Colorado Rockies, which may be the only way that Rockies can deal with the problems of playoffs, win one game by leading Los Angeles Dodgers to the West and NL.
Rockies have a single wild-card voice by winning 5-2 when they're already facing the Nationals on Fridays, but they're looking to catch their first break in the first division.
"But there's nothing we're playing, which remains that if it comes to the situation of the Denver followers and this other group will be playing a team at the top of all that I've been looking for this year.
What made me not want to play there?"
The Nationals are not the publishers who will play Sunday, but it seems as though they can distribute Scherzer to this event.
Scherzer, which may be 34 years old, had a bulpen hat on Thursday and would have taken his rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hand dealer has 2.53 ERAs and 220 strikeouts for 2/3 in this business.
Trump is a West Virginia dictionary
The president drew up his statement on the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court by stressing the importance of the Republican exit and the internal and neutral elections.
"All we've done at the market in November.
Five weeks before the most important choice in our health.
This is one of the majors, mostly -- I'm not running but you can say I'm running so I'm going everywhere to fight a successful soldier," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this exciting, disgruntled group of Democrats, which you see as it is now.
And they are determined to return to the hand in any way they can, just eat, and be clean.
But concerning those who are without authority, who don't have authority over them, and don't give them what they need.
Democrats, he said, are in the phrase "rebellious and disruptive."
"Well, if you look at the past four days," he said, telling Democrats "not warm, naked, and dirty and not true."
He then referred to the Senate's Law Committee called Sen. Diane Feinstein, a Democrat by name, who provided water for him in groups.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did he break the document?
Hey, hey, this is it.
No, for them, I said that his stand alone didn't tell me the good news - I've never seen a man's stand so rich to him."
The Working Group is no longer the congregation of any individual.
They are not passive speakers of their own ideas.
When the Momentum shells in our group screamed at me to shut my mouth, I didn't give a damn.
But of course, I'm not late for the MP's group of employees who are told they're not accepted -- just because of what we think.
Our Polish brother Joan Ryan has received almost the same treatment because of opposition to Semitics.
In my case, those who wanted to keep my mouth shut accused me of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the light of the importance of the proposed financial system, national security, Europe, and other amazing things Jeremiah has associated with other leaders.
In an announcement by a Working Group of Nottingham East of the Fifth Meeting, we say "we want meetings to be free and useful."
Almost every 18 years I'm the MP of our Working Group, the GC's five-day meetings have always been.
Sadly, today, it is not going to be a social gathering and the promise of a "feeling, and kind" policy has been forgotten long ago if, indeed, we have ever existed.
It will now become clear that different views were not acceptable in the Working Group and that opinions were judged as acceptable to the panel’s leaders.
This is just after Jeremy became the leader, and my brothers and I had the same political views as they saw me taking sides that I would not agree with — whether national security or the EU’s child market.
Whatever I talk about in society is not important and what I say is that there will be a gas of abuse in the media that says I’m not involved, that I’m not going to get involved in politics, that I don’t have to be part of the Working Group.
And we are not alone in dealing with this.
Of course, I know that I have more wealth than my brothers because the statements about me still like to be political.
I am surprised that our brothers are not involved in their work and their determination not to abandon themselves even in the face of sexual or ethnic cleansing.
One of the most striking features of this political era is the seemingly unusual form of oppression.
Jeremy Corbyn said that on the weekend the Labor party had to set a standard of limits.
The truth is that we do not celebrate this large and untrustworthy ceremony or the change in the rules of the funeral of the group will slow down.
I had many advice in the past two years that I was urged to deceive myself, don't talk too much, and it's going to be "I'm fine."
But there is nothing I can do about politics.
Since I met Labour 32 years ago as a student, I was strongly criticized by the Thatcher government for leaving the schools under siege, wanting to bring the best public services to those who need them most — perhaps as a local government or as a government government.
I have never been politically secretive, including the last option.
There is no one in Nottingham East in any way that you may be confused about the law of the state of imam and the areas of conflict with the current culture.
To those who encourage the trip on Friday, all I can say is that when the world moves forward in Brexit, that will make it easier for the family, the business and our public service, not to waste my time and strength faithfully to the leader of the Labor Party.
But indeed, another message I have not heard from Nottingham Momentum, which is difficult, can be members of the Labour or not: I discipline myself by serving you and I promise there will be no threat or policy that will prevent me from doing what I believe will be best for you all.
Leslie's Nottingham East MP
Eighth 38-17 Melrose: The one that has never been separated from the seat above
The two tries have not yet measured the final results, but the Ayr cannot be defeated is due to this modern game that is very good for Tennent's Premiership.
Now they are, indeed, on the side of the ten that cannot be separated.
Finally, their protection, whenever possible, has allowed them to leave home and train Peter Murchie for every cause of happiness.
He says, "We've been tested all our games so far, and they've never been separated, so I have to be happy."
Robyn Christie said to Melrose, "Blessed be the Father, who has given us more than we have."
The 14-minute star of Grant Anderson was introduced by Frazier Climo, who preceded Ayr, but, cap Rory Hughes of the socket found a white card, was released from the Warriors game, which led Melrose to make himself up of the team and Jason Baggot examined all the three.
Climo invited Ayr to move forward with a pennadial, just before, in the first round, put the soo trire to make 17-5 at Ayr on the table.
But Melrose on the second floor started well and Patrick Anderson's trick, put in Baggot, reduced the score by five points.
There was a time-consuming due to the severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was removed out of the forest, if they came from and powered Ayr continued through the Stafford McDowell's trip, imposed by Climo.
The Ayr's front gate is provided with a white card, and, Melrose, it's a little bit more than Bruce Colvine's, at last powerful.
The housekeepers returned, or so, and when Struan Hutchinson found a drinker after clearing the ice-free climate, outside the pennade line, MacPherson thrusts down the floor of Ayr.
Climo inserted, as he had done at first, after Kyle Rowe met with a broken ball David Armstrong sent this David Armstrong on the side of the house on the fifth floor.
Game star looks like a normal game
The Game star Ford Kieran seems to delay the transfer of fuel after discovering that you were notified as a registered director of the food company.
Jack Jarvis, who is 56 years old in the famous BBC program, wrote and became a careful dictionary as well as the Greek Hemphil.
Duo announces that the next half-year cycle will be the last point in the program, and Kiernan seems to live after Craiglang.
According to the list of administrators, you are the manager of the operating system Limited.
The observer refuses to comment on the matter, but the Scottish Sun source indicates that Kiernan sees it as part of Glasgow's "triving restaurant trade."
'the sea is ours': Bolivian authorities hope that the court will open the Pacific road
Drivers who bought the ring-clad main andval in La Paz.
Aircraft lifts the ocean-blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have the following insight: "The sea is our right sea.
Correction is our job.
In all parts of Bolivia, the coastline memory lost in Chile in the 19th century the source remains clear ba – as it yearns to go to the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may well exceed your years, Bolivia is expected to be ruled by a world court of justice on Saturday, October 1, after five years.
"Bolivia has the Power, the spirit of unity and humility, and in fact waits for the result of the red," said Roberto Calzadilla, who speaks Bolivia legally.
Many in Bolivia will watch the ICJ rulling on large screens everywhere, with a strong hope that the Hague court will produce Bolivia’s strength that – after decades of talks – Chile is forced to negotiate by allowing Bolivia to control part of the sea.
Evo Morales, the appropriate Bolivian president – who is facing long-term negotiations on elections in the coming year – has much to live in the Middle East.
"we are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," promised at the end of August.
But some would believe that the court is a small opportunity to produce Bolivia - and that name will change if it agrees.
The Netherlands-supporter UN has the power to colonize Chile's areas, arguing that the outcome of the talks will not be resolved.
That ICJ rulling only came in six months after the protests were heard to be "hard," said the Chilean law enforcement officer, Paz Zárate.
It also prevents Bolivia’s objectives from being fulfilled, perhaps four years ago.
"The issue of the permit to use the sea is not permitted by Bolivia's authorities," said Zarate.
The speech of Morales that fosters a spirit of coercion in Chile, he put it this way.
Bolivia and Chile will occasionally continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to continue talking after this.
Two countries that have changed rapidly since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, who is in Bolivia in Hague, has been making accusations that the court is too quick to make a decision.
The Revolution will bring Bolivia "the first unique opportunity to connect Chile" and the opportunity "to establish 139 years of disagreement with the interests of the two countries," he said.
Calzidilla also argues that Morales – one of the famous presidents in Latin America – used the seabed as a basis for politics.
"Bolivia will never give up its advice on the use of the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is a chance that we seem to need the victory that has passed."
North Korea states that the cease-fire of nuclear weapons will not happen unless it can hope for America.
North Korea's foreign government Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop fighting with nuclear weapons first unless they trust Washington.
Ri talks about the Conclusion in the context of neighbouring countries.
She told the United States that she was following her promises made at the Singapore conference among foreign leaders.
His observations were until the time of America. World writer Mike Pompeo looked at the first nuclear explosion three months after Singapore and Kim Jon Un in North Korea.
Ri says it is an ineffective dream that the continued U.S. invasion and refusal of the Korean war treaty that has ever made North Korea a failure.
Washington noted that he did not allow Pyongyang's announcements to begin to destroy his weapons.
Both Kim and U.S. / U.S. President Donald Trump is on the second round.
But there may be doubts about Pyongyang’s determination to quit the world that might look like the only way to escape.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim and Trump's second round.
The Paris factory is a lot of clothes on the head that comes to the shops near you
If you want to expand the list of clothing on or off, cover the sun completely.
Artists Valentino and Thom Browne showed a list of major head coverings in their SS19 box at a Paris Fashion Week exhibition.
Untrusted garments are covered in Instagram in this type, and the performers bring eye - catching scenes.
Valentino’s curve was a long cover on the side of the narrow side of the road and the narrow side of the head of the section’s head.
Some of the great gems include precious gems, a crown of medium - sized gold.
Thom Browne showed unusual faces in Halloween time.
Many eye-opening objects look like Hannical Lecter rather than an object built by the previous section's editors.
Another building is similar to waterproofing clothes with air and doors.
If you continue with an unbeknownst garment, you can put yourself in a bag.
Travelers note that large clothing may be on the way to large stores of goods.

John Edward: Farming skills are important to women.
Schools in Scotland keep details of the good results, and this continued in 2018 with some good results, which are guaranteed only by the success of one person and their sports, art, music, and other public efforts.
With a striking count of 30 thousand students in Scotland, these schools are expected by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), they are committed to bringing the help of higher education.
Schools that are to be planned for preparing students to enter the upper secondary school, as well as in selected fields and places as citizens of the world.
Like the educational center that can organize and initiate a special program of education, we see that the present - day crops continue to be a famous and popular field as a school - selected education.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that he hears, what he says will be right in his head."
If he speaks in his tongue, the words are open to his heart.
This powerful reminder that we would not always rely on English if we wanted to build up communication and trust with children from other countries.
From the results of this year’s testing, we can see that agriculture is the most advanced in high school.
Sixty-eight of all the students who learned foreign fields found themselves in Top Class A.
The students, gathered at the seventeenth and fourth schools of SCIS, suggest that seventy-two percent of the students received Higher Class A in Mandarin, since some seventy-two percent of German students, six and eight percent of those who learned French, some sixty-three percent learned Spanish and those who received A.
This suggests that schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as important skills for children, young people will undoubtedly need themselves in the future.
It is now as an optional education, being taken as the same as pre-school (scientific, professional, engineering, and mathematics) in schools that are to be organized and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that the reasons why managers were unable to shut down the 10 and seven percent (17 per cent) of language skills were achieved.
In particular, language skills will be important in preparing young ones for work opportunities.
With many of the work expected to take place in languages, these skills are important in a united world.
No matter what level a person takes, if he learns a second field, they take the best opportunity in their future to have the same ability as this one.
The ability to communicate directly with people from outside the country puts one who is able to speak more fluently to those who are in contact with them.
According to a YeuGov survey of over four thousand adults (4000) of the UK in 2013, some 17 (75 percent) could speak well of other countries outside and have a good conversation and French is the only adult population with two percent, 15 percent (15 percent).
That is why the growth of the teaching of plants is important to children today.
If you have a lot of crops you know, especially those in developing countries, it will help to reduce the opportunities you have to get a better job.
In Scotland, school and school are different from the language we are learning.
Many of these schools focus mainly on the education of older and modern farmers, while others teach the most important crops in the UK when it comes to the year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child likes, there are many kinds of flowers you can choose from high school, and you can guide the ants in this area.
Scotland's schools are committed to providing education that will prepare children and train children with the skills they need to succeed, in the long run.
Not to be overlooked in today’s business world is the fact that crops will continue to be important in the future of the world, so this is a field of education.
In fact, the current crops must be included in "all the world's communication skills."
The schools themselves will continue to offer this opportunity, separation, and divorce to the young Scots.
You have to do well.

Lakers' writer Mike Trudell tells Twitter that James has many opportunities to spend minutes.
After preparing for this week, James was asked about his program and Lakers with six games he had not played before.
"I don't need games to stress the first time I'm in my yard to start playing," he said.
The Trump's West Virginia Rally Time drive game is shown in the YouTube program
President Donald Trump begins the campaign on the night train in Wheeling, West Virginia.
The first five-week trip of Trump, which involved standing in the homes of Tennessee and Mississippi, was planned for the next week.
With a guarantee of a vote to close the court’s vote, Trump intends to build followers in this internal election as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Sabbath.
The Trip's election trip in West Virginia, will it begin at this time?
The Tromp election trip to Wheeling, West Virginia will begin at seven o'clock in the evening. IT at night, finally, 29 O'clock 2018.
You can view the Trump option path in West Virginia by entering YouTube now.
Trump may not have been accused of this church by a high court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was charged with the fines of the Senate's vote as the FBI is investigating.
But the campaign’s goal is to help the Republicans find an interest in the choice of the Sea.
Thus, President Trump said in his speech that these five vehicles will be scheduled for the coming week "to give interest to the volunteers and followers as the Republicans try to protect and increase the number of followers they have in the country," as Reuters said.
"the control of the summit is important to the president's travel plan for many countries that can't travel as fully as we are at the time of the campaign" contradicts the trumpet of Trump's campaign against Reuters that it has issued his name.
Organised by Wesbanco Arena es Wheeling, modern cars can bring followers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania to Pitttsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Finally, it will be the second two months of Trump’s visit to West Virginia, the country won no more than 20 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help those who need to enter the West Virgin Republic Senate.
"It is not a good sign to Morrisey that the president tries to make him vote," said Simon Haeder, a political candidate at West Virginia University, according to Reuters report.
Ryder's 2018 club The American team hopes to fight to keep its hopes alive in one day's games on Sunday.
After the three side meetings, on Saturday afternoon, these Ryder Cup games may have to be repeated four times.
A tool of interest is a fully-fledged game program, but players believe it, not equal.
Where, then, would they be now?
"They are guided by six points and are now younger, so we continue as if by little power I think" said Jordan Spieth as they drive slowly in the day.
Europe has opportunities, indeed, four points before twelve.
Americans, as Spieth says, can be very happy and many can be encouraged, not by Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together every day and every day finding only three points.
Spieth was always dangerous and led by example.
Those who watched were very happy when he was, patiently running the golf course was essential to balance the game when he and Thomas left each other together.
His golf course won the game with 15 similar joys, this type urges you to believe that the American team is not leaving.
"You're really going to be deep and worried about your game," said Speth.
As a single parent, they are not alone in caring for the needs of the family.
18 nodes to mark.
The only one of the most famous players to pass Spieth and Thomas two days ago were these Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, not questioned by this Ryder Cup.
Europe's oddd but the effort he has made so many and determined.
"Moliwood" were the only ones who wouldn't start the bogey on Saturday morning, but they avoided the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday and Friday morning.
This runs, in a second way, from this angry refusal that they will win the Church, and there will be no known players to win the European as the sun dies Le Golf National rather than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Double-declining depreciation [d]
The talk about glory in Europe has not changed, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did little work for Sergio Garcia, a team in the morning, when Alex Noren was arrested.
Both Bogey and the former doubles left the long Spanish and Swedish cave that they had never found.
By Sunday, no one will help you out of your camp.
Fourballs and foursomes enjoy looking close to each other because of their close cooperation, their advice, their firm advice, and how the island can change quickly.
Europe plays well as a group and eventually leads, but the forums have shown that the United States has still had the power to continue, by choosing states, to question.
Europe takes 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will have many good intentions on the last day of the Ryder Cup after the release of fourballs and foursomes on Saturdays 10-6 in the United States.
two Tommy Fleetwoods and Francesco Molinari won twice more than a hard hit by Tiger Woods by four points Le-Golf National.
On the European side, Thomas Bjorn, willing to cut down the threshold they had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, failed America in the furballs of the kitchen, set to about 3-1.
The U.S. is a tough and powerful forum, winning two games, but it won't stop the players.
On the other hand Jim Furyk needs eight points left in 12 Sunday games to keep the nest.
Fleetwood is the first in Europe to gain ideas from time to time along with Mollinari, he called it "Molliwood" after a good week of winning four points in their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
According to the separation of Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they then burned up the Woods and Bryson Dechambeau of America at 5&4.
Woods, who entered the two final games, showed great determination but now he has lost 19 of the 29 fourballs and foursomes each.
Justin Rose, who lives in the morning's forums, returned to Henrik Stanson's forums by 2&1 separating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and the third world class.
And they are determined to return to the hand in any way they can, just eat, and be clean.
Jordan Spieth and Justin three times separated the Americans by three points on Judgment.
They gained 2&1 by dividing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain into fourballs and then separated Poulter and Rory McIllroy by 4&3 in foursomes while playing two open boxes.
In the history of Ryder Cup only two times if the team comes from four drinks to each game, on the other hand, Furyk needs only balance to protect the nest.
After doing better for two days, or so, the attacks on the Church seem to break out.
North Korea says 'noke' can't swim without hope.
The North Korean Foreign Government told the United Nations that the United Nations will continue to deepen its unfaithfulness to the United States and that it will not be possible for the world to distribute nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world team of the General Assembly that North Korea has done "recovery" last year, such as keeping a gun and testing guns, eliminating nuclear sites, and promises not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He says, "Well, we don't see the answer from the U.S.."
"Untrustful U.S. there will be no hope for protection in the world, and under this situation there is no way we can put ourselves in the first place."
While Ri disagrees with North Korea's behavior regarding Washington's refusal to "square" the end of the lake is where North Korea may be affected by action, we are a victim of the fact that we do not prevent the total destruction of the lake as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri refers to the statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump first met with President U.S. and North Korea's leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim asked to work at the "denuclearization of the Korean penisula" while Trump promised to protect North Korea.
North Korea has always wanted to complete the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang should distribute the first nuclear weapons.
Washington still refused to release North Korea.
"U.S. continues with "first-time termination" and highlights the levels of law pressure to fulfill its purpose by force, and that it also rejects "an announcement to end war"” Ri says.
"To understand that the law can bring us under the dream of people who belong to us.
But the problem is that continuing to make progress increases our distrust of one another.
Ri didn't open up any programs to re-establish between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader from the United States came from the weekend.
He has at least three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If part of this issue is to be completed in South Korea and not in the U.S., the collapse of the Korean peninsula will not result in this commitment."
Or so said, Ri's hearing was completely different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that the U.S. was looking forward to the North Korea's rockets that happened after "Mr. Trump" called Kim "rocket man" in this regard.
In this year the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely end" North Korea, to raise Kim with her courage to take the right action, but there is much to be done and the law is still there until North Korea ends.
Thirdly, Trump says he doesn't have time for all of this, he says, "If it takes two, three, or five years – it doesn't matter."
Russia itself argues that the U.N. Security Council is obliged to adopt Pyongyang in action.
Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday: "Secure Council on Thursday must continue with strength and will not fail until we see the end, completely, and evidence of the nuclear destruction."
Security Council has approved North Korea's support for breaking the law since 2006 in establishing the payment of the tax as well as the private ballistic scheme of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri Mám with the U.N. General Assembly and said that after all they had spent the next month preparing for the second month.
Pompeo has recently visited North Korea three times this year, but his final trip is not good.
He left Pyongyang in July for a preliminary ruling, of North Korea only by openly expressing it "in the form of a crime."
North Korea organizes a meeting with Moon this month to end the missile and nuclear assembly if the United States takes "the same steps."
He said Kim told me "the same steps" he wanted to strengthen security when Trump promised Singapore and caused a common relationship with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to help them grow up
A new course at Harvard University this year all the non-smokers are dying to overcome the habit of smoking using caffeine 'all night.'
School classes have found many students from previous verses that they are not good at being informed of basics that they can take good care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep at Harvard Medical School and a doctor in Brigiham and Women's Hospital, started the course, the first of which was the U.S.
She was encouraged to start the course after giving a talk about how to sleep while reading.
"The young woman came to me, and said, 'How is it that I am told this day, since I am a virgin?'
And he said, No man ever told him his dream, I wonder. And he wept.
Course was first published this year, explaining to the students the importance of sufficient sleep habits to help the card and to improve the quality of the day - to - day living.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health services, says a university student decided to die after discovering that many students are sleeping this way during the week.
The length of the study involves a series of steps taken.
The first part has a picture of the school room, when students choose coffee conductors, voters, trainers, and books about the consequences of caffeine and the light how self-sacrifice helps you grow up, as well as how to sleep.
On the other hand, participants are told that long - term avoidance of bedtime increases the chances of heart disease, tuberculosis, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campaign, with helpful features, will encourage those who share in encouraging them to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not turn out well for the disciples."
We believe that they have the right to know — just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke,' he adds Professor Czeisler.
The practice of 'dwelling up to' is what is done, that is, adding that modern technology and extreme pressure among students reduces the problem of sleep levels that go to the city.
To make sure that you sleep enough, enough, must be a ‘ secret weapon’ of the student to overcome stress, anxiety and anxiety, which means that it is not enough to sleep, as sleeplessness puts the mind into the mood, which makes them cling.
Raymond Shuthi, a 19-year-old student in California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to complete the study, who studied at one of his high school classes during his first year in Harvard.
He gave the lesson with tears in his eyes and urged us to study the lesson and then to the whole building.
The next step, of course, is to ask high school students to study in the same way as this school program before they join a competition center.
Prof Czeisler suggests that students should consider setting off the alarms while they are asleep, and also that they will wake you, and understand the bad consequences of the ‘green light we have opened’ screens and the LED light, which could come out of the circle, leading to the level I should have.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The only time to slow down Gerrard's hands
Rangers was organized and marched during the defeat of Dolly Menga, who attacked Steven Gerrard’s infamous side and fell down in 1 to 0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox has long been trying to capture their first round since he won February 4.1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's second-off team at Gerrard's 18th games as the manager left his back side with eight points to the leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
You've been attacked in seven minutes before half-time and Rangers' players are suffering from a lack of money.
Now that the Rangers are scheduled for the sixth place, Livingston boasts a third place and after Hebronian leaves each other with his own notes.
And there would be a problem in the Rangers after you hit the Calum Spence first-handed aid after the accident of a card that caused some distance around.
Gerard made eight changes on the past side of Ayr to the Bethfred Cup terminals.
Holt, on the other hand, goes with the 11th of the same Liverance to the Hearts last week and boasts how well - dressed your clothes cut the air around her walls.
Irangers may have a lot to do with the ball, but Livingston has done a lot of good with the ball he found.
I then slept for two minutes while Menga’s release sends Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s article, but the player who played in the game lost a great opportunity to steal the ball.
Keaghan's free kick Jacobs took Craig Halkettoyy-shipper, but his companion Alan Lithgow's companion was not far behind.
Rangers was able to control but was more reliable than to believe in their game in the third phase of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have found penalty at a time similar to Steve Lawless, but he's wearing Steven Thomson's application for a Colombian flag.
Rangers can put two articles in the first section directly to the pope, but the elderly Ibrox Liam Kelly is not concerned about the rejection of Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's wounded attack.
During the time that Livi opened today in 34 minutes may have been out of play, no one could deny that they were worthy of their work.
Rangers also failed to cope with Jacobs’ football club.
Scott Arfield did nothing while Declan Gallagher called out to Scott Robinson, who called us to send Menga to her for her simple end.
Gerrardube and his wife were after the funeral when she changed Colibaly to Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately caught the attention of a player in Morelos but Kelly, who was impressed by his line of work to store it.
But Livingston continued to explain the audiences by playing interesting games, and Lithgow and Halkett traveled long distances behind others.
Holt’s case could have opened the gate in the final stages, but McGregor insisted that Jacobs refuse before Lithgow rides his head into the kitchen.
Granders Glenn Middleton has long discovered a pony at a time similar to Jacobs but Thomson is also looking at it.
Almanac: Geiger Counter's funeral · Global Voices
And And now our page "in the Sunday Sunday" Almanc: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and BALA ... the day the physicist came to Johns Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a way to find and measure radioactivity, which led to the last commercial built only by the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has turned the pop lead, as in the late 1950s "Bells of Coronado," to which scientists are worried by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is that?"
Rogers: "The Geiger Counter, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you insert the mounted earphones, you can hear the atoms produced by radioactivity with mineral."
Evans says, "They're going out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days ago he was 63 years old.
But this original one bears his name forever.
A new target of cancer can teach the immune system to "see" wrong cells
A new target of cancer can teach the immune system to “see ” wrong cells and kill them
The goal is to teach the self-protection style of the wrong cells as a treatment program
How to include in your child's form, modified
'He saw' the common protein for many cancers and then re-emerged
The target of breast cancer indicates the promising effects on patients with various types of cancer.
The target woman, who teaches self-defense to see wrong cells, saw a cancer of the brain disappear in more than 18 months.
This way includes taking the cells prescribed in the patient, converting the laborethri to "see" the common protein for many HER2 cancers, then re-opening the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says: "Our results are that we have a promising goal."
HER2 "enhancing the development of cancer species," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
Another way to take the cells mentioned in the patient "can teach them" is how you understand the cancer cells that function well in cutting off some type of leukemia.
One West was in the mind of Trump, the head of MAGA, after his sudden appearance.
Not Well - Started
One West was announced a study on Saturday Night Live after singing praises to American President Donald Trump and saying that he will make an election in 2020.
After singing his third night song, called the Ghost Town, which was dressed in a poem written by Mace America Great, he began to shout at the Democrats and assured Trump’s approval.
"Nevertheless, I will speak to a man who doesn't love Him. How can you love him, and stop him?"
If, I was concerned about prejudice, I'd been going to America long ago," he said.
The SNL begins the program with Matt Damon’s section when he is known to Hollywood to consider the evidence of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate's Judicial Committee on the lyrics of the song by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although undisclosed, the West’s angry section was put in contact boxes by Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock tried to persuade West.
Yet, West complained to the observers that they had taken him seriously after I put him on the front porch.
"They confirmed me behind the stage.
They said, 'It's not that head.'
They tried me!
And they said, "I'm in the ghetto," he said, according to the Researcher of Washington.
West continued: "Do you want to see a place in the cave?" he says, "He can wear his superman cap, because it means he won't tell you what to do. Do you want the earth to move forward?
I'm going to make it."
Not only have they been told twice by the shameless SNL viewers and team of SNL, Variety report, alone telling printers: "A thousand studies have been closed."
West was introduced with the permission of the singer Ariana Grande in time, his former poet, the rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West sings many by singing I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West was defeated by the head of the former TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter, said: "A very brave spirit: I've been given a chance to save you."
But the editor of the program to talk to Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "is a human being who doesn't sit and that's good."
"But I choose to hire a person (by buying his music or his dress or by putting his "art") whom I believe to be left and filled with a dangerous idea in the community.
You're free.
So let's do it," he added.
Before the show, the rapper turned to Twitter that he changed his name, saying he will now be called "in the name of the old Kanye West."
He is not the first singer to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known by Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
The rapper, Snoop Dogg, once called Snoop Lion with him, actually killed the anointed singer Prince, changed his name markedly and was named Prince.

A prominent player in the Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington condemns bad guys' traditions
KIT Harrington knew much about the playoffs of Jon Snow in the ancient history of the HBO-based game of Thrones.
But the shepherd, 31, criticized the young man’s playmate’s custom, saying that such places on the screen should be for young boys to be firm for respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says he believes in why he can walk well and asks how to be viewed by a bad man’s tradition in the times of #Nami Also.
Kit, who recently married his brother in Game of Thrones Leslie, also admitted that he had been ‘committed’ to deal with this problem.
"I feel really, very affected, what now - is life going on with this man?" he said.
"What do we teach men when we grow up, as we do now?"
Kit believes that a blind person can slow down the bad man’s habit of raising him from the dead
He continued: 'What is the nature of being taught?
What was taught on TV, on the street, making young boys confident of being a man?
Do I think that is a major problem at this time — is it really changing?
For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
In the discussion you also agreed that you will not make prequels or sequels in Game of Thrones while the game will end with the last type, saying you're finished with horses' courts.
Since November, Kit will play in the True West of Sam Shepard’s story about the film and his brother, who is playing.
The shepherd continues to show that he feels that his wife, Rose, will be the most outstanding thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife, and she gave me a piece of bread on the next day, and I was left alone."
Rose played Ygrintte, the love of Kit character Jon Snow, on the edge of the Emmy fantasy series.
These couples were married on Saturday, 2018, in their respective Leslie prisons in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% of progress in new situations
China announces an increase of 14% of the population living with the AIDS virus and leads to the AIDS virus.
More than 880,000 people are affected by this world, health authorities say.
The new cases are approximately 40,000 reported in the second round of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases came.
Many of the new cases are transmitted by chance, making changes from time to time.
But the number of people diagnosed with AIDS in this way has reduced almost to zero, the health authorities of China said regularly at a Union national convention.
It's 20 years old, but the number of people living with the AIDS virus and leading the AIDS virus has risen to 100,000.
The conflict in the LGBT community now poses a small problem.
The condemnation of homosexuality in China was cleared in 1997, but the divorce of homosexuals was widespread.
Because of the way of life, research has shown that 70-90% of males and other males remain married to women.
Much of the risk of disease stems from self - defense rather than from this system.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to reach the earth with earthquakes such as earthquakes to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that another job has published the information of GOP senators, issuing 'dangerous walls' or 'exploitations'
in the U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters quotes the fact that one of his employees placed three senators in the Republican in the U.S. on the law page in Wikipedia.
Democrats of Los Angeles explained that these are often referred to as "be-ultra-right swing" and bulsettes.
"Talk, lie, and many other lies are wet," said Watters to the website on Twitter.
The missing details include the U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah and Utah.
Information appeared online on Thursday, a stranger to Capitol Hill while listening to the Senate panel on the abuse of the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh.
The explosion appeared after Kavanaugh had asked three senators questions.
Old satellites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address indicates that the Waters office is linked to and that it is the source of the Waters work details, reports Hill.
"These unconfirmed claims are false and are not true," Waters continues.
"The good of my employees – the property, the personal details, and the safety of the criminals as a result of the conditions of mass destruction and injury – did not involve the person's disappearance.
These are not fundamentally false and are not true."
Waters' campaign soon became a online crime, including an old White House press by Ari Fleischer.
"Response is required," wrote Fleischer.
"This explains that there is no chance of breaking the League of Nations.
If a person is punished for something he has not done, he should not be punished.
He does not have to reject them.
They should not be faulted with the motives of the wind.
They shall be quiet and at peace.
Fleescher said that he compared Waters’ answer to the criticism of the Democrat Jaji Kavanaugh, who was accused of the most common critics at the time of the trial on Monday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican employee who will enter Waters’ gates in the middle of the day, was inspired by his thoughts on Twitter.
"Mostly if it's true," wrote on Twitter.
In his tent, Waters said his office had declared "the right and the wrong of the lawmakers on these conspiratorial charges.
"We will ensure that the guilty are released," he continues, "and they will be held accountable for all their acts of humiliation and danger wherever my servants are."
View of Johnny English Strings Again – restored the spy poof power of Rowan Atkinson
It is customary now to consider Brexit’s importance to any British film and it is not apparent that the resurrection of Johnny English – which started in 2003 and Johnny English and was restored in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Eating hot apples as mentioned in the article that we can have a new opportunity to sell outside?
In any measure, the open - minded father, Johnny English, has the authority to encourage new things in the second place — that name is a major title created by the courts of non - English - speaking movies.
In fact, it is an unskilled auditor's agency that even his unusual exercise will bring glory to Clouseau, referring to Mr. Bean and his fuel from the Chariots of Fire theme in the London open war 2012 Olympics.
And it is taken from the visitor by a secret man at Atkinson who is now in trouble with Barclaycard TV, who has left the debate on his resurrection.
There are times and twice in the current JE visit.
I love Johnny English, who will take the helicopter to the front of an old military uniform and a small belt that hangs on his head.
The Atkinson's gift is a show, but the entertainment looks down and very shy, especially in the production of "juule" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself now gives the stars as an influence.
We are more than children than adults, and Johnny English’s journey has never been boring and new and focused on the violent Atkinson film added to Bean’s anger and personality.
The story in history is that Great Britain is a major continent.
The cyber hacker comes to the British research network, presenting an account of Britain's interest in the field, which concerns the interest placed on the job – which is a small job in Kevin Eldon.
The last minute of the prime minister who brought the young man and the young man was a riot, confronted by a political failure: Emma Thompson is trying hard to imitate Teresa-May but there is no reason to write about it.
His investigators announced that all the investigators had been tortured, and he would have to send someone to prison.
This means that Johnny English is actually, now as a schoolmaster in the neighborhood, but it gives unsolicited lessons about how to examine: these songs, as English provides research lessons in the Rock-type Academy.
English is inspired in Whitehall to be given urgent orders and combined with Bough's partner, also played by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man, associated with the submarine commander, a nice place to play with Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin make real beds in the Queen's Secret Service back, meeting Olga Kurylenko's autotiful feme fatala Ophelia Bulletin.
At the same time, the prime minister is quick to blame the millions who say he can solve computer problems: the sister Jason Volta, named Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began a long journey: they looked like wet, they started fire at a restaurant in France; they started the problem of painting themselves on a boat such as Volta; and the English that took off the border while learning to use the Virtual Reality headset to use the Volt's home.
All efforts have been made to improve the quality of the final section, or we have a relationship with the brain, rather than the television of the children about everything.
To set them free.
And like other Johnny English films, couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a better location in his room?
Libour denies that they make a proposal that Britons work for four days but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's labour's team is thinking of a wonderful plan to see Britons working for four victims — but not five.
The group reports that it wants company managers to transfer the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the employees by giving them more date.
It seems that the workers enjoyed the same three days of the week — but they managed the same money.
The sources say that this view can fit the group’s economic objective and plan to turn the country into a worker.
The four-day shift is authorized by the Trade Union Congress as a means of taking advantage of the economy.
An adult Labour Party source added The Sunday Times: ' Police investigation is expected to be done before the end of the year.
'Not overnight but four days in the church, but working for four days is a goal of the team's method of rebuilding the economy and the entire concept of the field.'
Labour Party will not be the first to commend us, and the Green Party will join in four working days during the 2017 general election campaign.
The goal is not based on the entire Labour Party, or so.
"The four-day work is not the police of the organization and is not considered by the group."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the last church source of Labor to express his view of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mnz McDonnell says he's determined to drown and power has returned to ‘unknown drivers’ and ‘profits’ in the production industry.
The program also explains that the shareholders in the water companies may not find all the shop like the Labour government make a ‘dangerous’ in the wrong way.
He also made sure to put employees in the company's boards and Inclusive Knowledge Funds to give 10 per cent of the private-sector companies' equity to the employees, who would pay a fine of £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, quoted "60 Minutes" as saying that the FBI research on Kavanaugh could change their minds.
A FBI survey by Journey Brett Kavanaugh reduced the time of the vote for the Supreme Court last week, and raised questions that the discovery of the stars could change how senators in the Republican can move their followers.
In a discussion held on Sunday, "60 Minutes" with Scott Pelley asked the Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI if they could find something to change their minds.
Kennedy appears to be more independent than his South Carolina peers.
"I'll tell you, really," said Kennedy.
"I went to the side, Nat, I spoke to Jaj Kavanaugh.
I called after this one, and they came out immediately, and said, "Do you do it?"
He has a sharp tongue, and he has a sharp tongue, that he does not speak.
Graham’s vote, or otherwise, appears to have been decided.
"My mind is determined by Brett Kavanaugh and will take serious accusations," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett immediately objected," adds Graham, describing Christine Blasey Ford.
"Not all complainers are sure of that.
It has been 36 years.
There is nothing that can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has Attempted to Reduce Alcohol?
In this New York Council will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event with a list of players who will be proud of them and have the same goal; to end poverty on earth.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will have more people arriving in a large prison in Central Park not only to be thanked not only by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but to warm up with the real intention of ending the murder in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, defined in 2012, is the Global Poverty Project, a global group that strives to eradicate poverty by increasing its population.
In order to find the object tag (other than you want to pay the VIP ticket), visitors would have to do something "to do" like volunteer, send a mail to the world's leader, call or do something to help you stop the pregnancy.
How successful has the Global Citizen achieved its goal over the past 12 years?
Is the idea of benefiting people by the media is the right way to try to do something, or just something called "clictivism" — people who feel that they make a difference by signing a list on the computer or sending to a Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has "actions" of more than 19 million of its followers, promoting the adoption of various objectives.
It says that this has helped to cut down on earth’s owners in peace and with the goals of over $37 billion that will affect the health of 2.25 billion in 2030.
In 2018 the team reviewed 390 opinions and comments from their actions, about $10 billion or more was added or was rejected.
The group estimates that the money collected directly contributed to the world’s population of about 649 million.
Another dedication involving The Power of Nutrition, U.K. farmers and beginners who gave themselves "to help children properly," is promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end hunger in the developing world after reaching 4,700 tweets in Global Cities.
"With the backing of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens, like you, we can try to make history of human inequality because of the lack of justice in the community," The Power of Nutrition amissador Tracey Ullman recently protested in London in April 2018.
The group also said that there are over 5,000 years to call the U.K. to improve healthy food for mothers and children, the government announces the support of the project, the Power of Nutrition, which provides women and 5 million children on a healthy diet.
In response to some of the FAQs on their website, they ask, "What do you think we can do to eliminate major poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "There will be a long and difficult way – sometimes we will get tired and fail.
But, as public rights and anti-partidism before us, we will win, because we are very strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée, and others who will contribute to this annual event in New York, followed by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. U.S. might use the "supply" counter to Russia's energy transmission - Interior Secretary
Washington "if necessary" could use the Amants to store Russian energy markets, including Middle East, U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan All released, under the auspices of Washington Examiner.
All of you say Russian and Syria’s talks – clearly, when it works through the rule of law – is the way to try other new energy markets.
"I believe in the reason that the Middle East wants to find energy like Eastern Europe, and in the context of the territory and Europe," he said.
And, according to the employee, there are ways to correct it.
"The United States is able, through our team, to ensure that sea routes are opened, and, if necessary, closed, to ensure that their power is not going to be marketed," he said.
Zinke also spoke with members of a group that could be taken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group that called itself "a power crisis" in the U.S.
He also compared Washington’s efforts to work with Russia and Iran, with similar results.
"The choice of trade with Iran and Russia, at some point, is a means of obtaining and obtaining oil," he said, when he spoke of Russia as "a horse with wings" and has a reliable economy on the oil lines.
These ceilings appear as the Trump offices make efforts to encourage the transmission of their natural gas to Europe, which comes instead of Russia, the most expensive route for European buyers.
As a result, officials of the Trump office, including U.S. president Donald Trump himself, are trying to encourage Germany to leave the North Stream 2 "inappropriate", according to Trump, making Berlin "under" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream pipe is $21 billion, which is twice the size of the pipe that is now 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion cubic meters], not really a economic project.
Kremlin says opposition to Washington's project inevitably results in economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we have the same view that power cannot be a force to impose pressure and that buyers should be able to choose who they are to buy," said Russian Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Secretary of Power Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position made Germany famous, reconfirming its commitment to this project.
A leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told the U.S. to be committed to the EU's energy target and agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country interrupts our sending power," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a last meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "You're going to see" Elections as President in 2020, Massachuts Senator says
Massachussets Senator Elizabeth Warren came to the "visual" conclusion of the election to be president after the mid-term election.
During the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren has made sure that he will consider joining the election.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and adjust our corrupt government to include a woman who will be the leader," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will look into the election as president."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during a city hall meeting, saying "he was talking to people who were threatening him.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump did to our people," he said.
Warren spoke freely against Trump and the Supreme Court of Britt Kavanaugh.
In what he wrote on Twitter on Friday, Warren said, "It's true that we need a FBI investigation before voting."
A report published on Thursday, however, shows that most of Warren's followers do not think they should make the choice by 2020.
50 percent "probably" people of Massachusetts say that the senator should not have a choice, in accordance with the figures found by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 per cent have supported that it is not available.
Statistics show another support that former Governor Deval Patrick had no choice, 38 per cent that he did not have enough and 48 per cent said he did not.
Some of the names discussed by the high-profile Democrats who may have reached the 2020 election include President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will legally decide on January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Trick Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's funeral
Track Palin, aged 26, spends a year in Iraq after the war on Sept.
He was arrested and put in jail at home on Monday night
"What my son is experiencing, what he is experiencing is coming back, I see how he feels about other families facing the painful consequences of PTSD and other damage to the soldiers we are returning," he told the audience at the Donald Trump convention in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a soldier in the camp" and said about his son and other soldiers, "they were different people, they were confirmed, and they asked themselves if there was any respect for what the soldiers and the air forces, and all the other soldiers, did not do for their country."
He was arrested by the Vasilla Revolution, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence by beating a woman, disrupting the family play report and the time spent, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasilla Police Chamber.
18 states, D.C. supports the work of the new protection agenda
The 18 countries and the District of Colombia support the new legal effort to have a new U.S. target that prevents the protection of people who have fled from the cultural or home environment.
The representatives of 18 countries and the region sent the document to witness on Friday in Washington to support a person who needed protection against this target, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the miracleer in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union introduced in August against the unexploded purpose of the government.
She told her companions "with her sons, who were members of my bad habits," they tortured her but U.S. officials could still accept her request for protection on July 20.
He has been settled in Texas.
Government officials who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced many people with requests for protection by the U.S., such as countries facing major problems with homelessness and homelessness.
A new U.S. protection campaign is a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allows homeless visitors to leave their homes for protection.
The Attorney General of the Columbia Foundation Karl Racine said in his speech on Friday that the new goal "is to mark the decades of the rule of law, and the whole world."
"The law says that all requests for protection must be judged on the facts of each application, and making such a decision is a violation of that law," the court-martial witness said.
The officials also pointed out that the goal of preventing immigrants from ruining the U.S. economy, saying they could be businessmen and "started jobs."
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions advised visiting parties that they would no longer protect people who fled from home and traffic accidents in June.
"People can be protected if they leave their country because of persecution or persecution because of race, religion, nationality, or whether a member of a group or political opinion," Sessions said in his presentation on June 11th with a purpose.
Protection was not intended to eliminate all problems -- even all major problems -- people facing every day around the world.
Great efforts have been made in Palu as the number of dead is repeated in the efforts to find survivors
For those who were saved, the situation was distressing.
"It's really sad," said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her son at the hospital of those who had survived in the city of Palu.
"Every minute the amphibians carry bodies.
Nor is it clean water."
The inhabitants seem to return to their abandoned homes, look at their possessions in many waters, try to find anything they can find.
Hundreds of people also need hospitals, which are subjected to 7.5 shocks, were full of fish.
Some of these patients, including Dwi Haris, who had broken the neck and shoulders, were outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside because of persistent injuries.
He filled his eyes with tears as he remembered how sad he was at the hospital in the fifth floor where he and his wife and daughter were living.
"There was no time to look for a way to save.
I was stressed by broken walls, I think," Harris added the Associated Press, adding that his family is in the city of marriage.
"I felt my wife crying for help, and it calmed again.
They don’t know what’s going on with him and with my child.
I hope that they will live."
U.S. urges China's 'dangerous' with high levels'
After a week of China's legal paper has a four-page U.S. marketing document that benefits both U.S. and China, a U.S. press in China accused Beijing of using an American newspaper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last July spoke of China's Daily payroll in Des Moines Register - the Iowa newspaper that was wrongly bought - after accusing China of wanting to enter into the election issue on November 6 in the U.S., which China rejected.
The claim that Beijing is trying to get into the U.S. election is what U.S. officials from Reuters are a new part of Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for governments in other countries to sell them, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that requires constant taxation when sending goods.
The money demanded by China at the beginning of the commercial war was intended to corrupt the ambassadors in such places as Iowa supporting the Republican Party of Trump, saying Chinese and U.S. reformers.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. candidate in China and one who was a long-term ruler in Iowa, who sent many agricultural goods to China, says Beijing damages American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in the Sunday News of Des Moines Register, "we are twice the victim of this by making false statements in our newspaper."
"In the event that has been published, the Chinese government has made it available to a popular American court of freedom of speech to the newspaper by putting a promotion paid to the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the contrary, instead of selling newspapers on the road here in Beijing, there are many different views that you will find and you will not see the real reaction of China's different views that may have with the consequences of the Chinese economy, if it is thought that the media are looking at what the Chinese Communist Party has to say," he writes.
He added that "one of the press that goes forward in China has escaped an opportunity to print" his story, although he did not mean what it was.
Republicans Celebrate Women prior to the Internal Election due to Kavanaugh’s Failure, warning developers
Since many of the higher republics are waiting and protecting the opportunity to be brought to the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh on a number of charges of harassment, the developers have warned that the wood will return to the farmer, especially for the standers, during the choice between the future and the future.
Top papers on this, and many Republicans have already indicated that they wanted to proceed with the election.
These things will no longer be arranged," Grant Reeher, a professor of politics at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published by the Council.
Reeher argues that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s final efforts to do research will be sufficient to make angry voters turn the papers.
"Women won't forget what happened tomorrow - they won't be forgotten in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a black-and-white counselor and a global speaker of the moveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the prosecutors called out, "You're coming to November!" as they were in the Senate as the Republicans controlled the Judicial Committee that chose to proceed and select Kavanaugh despite the evidence issued by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Democrats' zeal and courage will end," said Stu Rothenberg, a political reformer, telling reporters.
The people said, "It's enough. This is the truth.
But it's more than that, especially between women's voters in cities and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, that although they don't like the president, they don't usually vote."
Even before the Ford's evidence has been made clear that there are details of his complaints against the time before the Supreme Court, noting that the timber can be returned to the driver if the Republicans continue to advance and confirm.
"This is already a breach of the GOP," said Michael Steele, who was chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"Not only about the committee vote or the final vote or that Kavanaugh is placed on the table, about how the Republicans can do this and how they treat him," said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a group that helps people choose Democrats, telling the media station.
The Americans, however, seem to differ between who were invited to the Ford and the Kavanaugh evidence, and are inclined to see Kavanaugh.
New figures from YuGov show that 41 percent of people believe in the evidence of Ford, whereas 35 percent say that they are sure or at some level believe in the Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh was certain or at some point lying to the evidence he had given, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least one suspect, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford spoke in front of the Senate Judicial Committee closed last week that Kavanaugh had been arrested at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that a prosecutor at the Supreme Court presented his positions in the government during your studies in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web founder starts a new Google and Facebook network
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, begins a program that matches the walls of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new technology project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open source of the Berners-Lee platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people are allowed to access.
In a special discussion with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee made a joke that Inrupt's purpose was "to control the earth."
"We have to do it now," he always says about this job.
"It's a waste of history."
This app uses Solid technology to allow people to create "a personal online data storage site" or a POD.
Do you also have lists of people’s numbers, which should be made, the calendar, the music library, and other professional and human tools?
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are found in one browser and at the same time.
Noteworthy for the POD store that it depends on the user who can find any type of data.
The company calls it "the oil that makes you strong."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company John Bruce, is that the company carries rice, prosthesis and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
This company is now Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform based on IBM, non-profit workers working on the project, as well as many volunteers.
Since this week, professional beginners around the world may have started their apps using the tools available to the Inrupt government.
Berners-Lee said he and his group spoke to "Facebook and Google whether it is right or not to bring about a complete change where all their businesses will change completely.
"Ask for their permission."
In one post on the Media printed on the Final, Berners-Lee writes that Inrupt "needs to give us the strength of trade and working system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based document."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has led to a debate on non-violence.
Even when Inrupt is released, Berners-Lee will continue to be the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I look at the beginning of the future of the document," add Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A teacher who found Victoria Cross on the WW1
Only the Church of England’s clergy who did not join Victoria Cross during World War I had been deported to their city 100 years later.
Lord Lord Lord Bernard Vann received the title on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed four days later and did not find out that he had won the greatest prize in the British army.
The memorial stone has been opened to two of its grandpas during the time of the storm in Rushden, Northamptonshire, by the end.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "good sign" that the stone was opened in the year of the great year since his grandfather received the title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his army to defeat the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a battle that was submerged with guns and guns."
Later he rushed to where we were shot, and "with great courage" led ahead before running and carrying a gun and killed three soldiers.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German bomber on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says his grandfather's actions "are things I don't know I couldn't do but something I can do to respect him."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were behind the scenes, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "a country with great privilege for having a share in the harvests" and said "a genuine brotherhood is shown with the support of many people."
MMA followers stayed all night watching Bellator 206, but found Peppa Pig
Just think, you stay all night looking at Belletor 206 and being banned from watching the scene.
The San Jose event was 13 games, including six in the main card and was displayed all night in UK on Channel 5.
On 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the war, the UK officials were surprised when the station moved to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy after waiting all night until I was especially late for the trip.
One Twitter tracker described this change to the child's life "as an unexpected dream."
"It is a government law that in 6 a.m. this movement is not appropriate so it has to be changed into the order of the children," says Dave Schwartz, president's presidential prize for commerce and communication, when asked about this change in the scheme.
"U Peppa the Pig," yes."
The president of the Bellator company Scott Cooker said they would look at their sails to include UK observers in the future.
"I think that if I think about playing it again, I think we can try to play it," Coker said.
"But it's the sixth hour on Sunday when we can't fix it until it's the Church in our time, the Revolution in their time.
But it is more than that.
I tell you, as time passes, there are many instructions that are sent to each other and they are not always pleasant.
They tried to fix it, thinking it was a technical problem.
But it was not, it was a matter of government.
I promise that it will never happen again.
We will keep up with five trips as we often do and try to make our followers happy and tire out.
There's a situation I don't want."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'closed' because of his sex
The Olympic poet Tom Daley says he grew up as a child because of his sex -- but that gives him a sense of success.
The 24-year-old teacher said he wasn't aware and went to high school saying, "Not everyone likes me."
Speaking of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs distributed by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke of the rights of the intellectual to give others "hope."
He also said that if the parent made me have a case against the Olympics.
A regular part of the program is available, Christy Young, who is inactive for months because he is ill.
From a person who was left behind in Laverne's first order, Daley says he felt "out of wedlock" everyone in his early years because "it wasn't accepted to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are nothing, but are different. He has given me the strength and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "a man," he said, so that no one would be disappointed when finally found he was a traitor.
The winner who won the title of the Olympics twice became a high-ranking LGBT professional and used his position in the Games of the Commonwealth in Australia this year to persuade other countries not to view you as a fraud.
You have spoken because you feel helpless so that they can live a quiet life without having to face problems and want to give others a "hope."
This three-time winner of the world's movement is going to love a man - the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met with him in 2013 - "unexpected arrival."
Daley married and was awarded the Oscar Prize, left 20 years ago, but said that it was never a problem to leave each other for years.
"When you face so much in life you're so young" - to his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later - you say it's hard to find someone equal to you who has ever faced the same conditions.
These two found a child in June, a son who was supposed to be Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "his opinion" has changed.
"If you could ask me last year, they would understand that 'I need to win a gold coin'," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold chains.
And my gold of the Olympics is Robbie."
Her son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he wondered if he had any tickets to London 2012 - as he wanted to be there.
"I couldn't say 'you can't be in those games," he said.
"I held her hand where she breathes the last and even when she breathes the last and dies where I saw she's a man like us," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympics movement and received a visa.
"I saw that even here what I have always wanted for my whole life - to torture my people in the Olympic Games, nothing more than that," he said.
It also made him choose the most popular song - Heather Small's Proud - while he talks in mind during the preparation of the Olympics and put it in his mind.
The Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Michaelson is a bad player based on Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will record a story on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to raise the casinos so that it is not a sad story.
Michaelson, who has been living in this event for the past two 12 years, is sitting on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk on the Foreballs and the Final Forums.
Rather than taking the lead, as he often takes the lead when listening to the United States, the five - year - old winner divided the day into two parties and worked in his game with the hope of finding out what was troubling him.
Since you are not the right person to play the ball even if you have time for this game, this 48-year-old player is not suitable for this game that killed the Le Golf National, where there is a place where the girl is usually a problem if you play the ball away.
And if the place to play is not so much a problem, Michaelson, who will play the eighth game on Sunday, will face Francesco Molinari, the British Open, capable of riding a horse, playing with Tommy Fleetwood red to win four of their games this week.
If these Americans, who lost four points in 12 single player games, started a game well, the game of Michaelson could be a drawback.
Furyk expresses his hope for his brothers, nothing else he says.
"You fully understood the role you had today, you threw me into the woods and told me you'd be ready tomorrow," Fryk said.
"You're very confident.
He is a well - known and successful player in the past and this week.
I probably never thought of playing two games.
I waited for more, but that is what happened and what we thought we should do.
You want to play, like everyone else."
Michaelson will complete a new history of the past with Nick Faldo most of the most popular games in Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It might be his last game on the Ryder Cup you've never played before as a player.
Michaelson won 18 times, he was eaten 20 times as much as he did, even though Furyk said his presence had promoted the group.
"It's nice to be with her, she likes to crash, she laughs, she likes to make jokes about people, and she's a nice person if she's in the group room," he explained.
"I think young players have been happy to be with him, and, in this report, it's good to see you.
And many other things he doeth, and yet he doeth them not.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that many points are nothing
Thomas Bjorn, a European president, knows that taking many points on the last day of the rebellion in Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
Dane played for the first time in the 1997 Valderrama game, when a team with the Seve Ballesteros captain led five points over the United States but eventually took the lead on one point, won by 141⁄2-131/2.
"You always remember that we had many points in Valderrama; we had many points in Brooklyn, where we were eaten, and Valderrama, where we were, but for a few points," said Bjorn, who was on the team, after seeing the 2018 class won 5-3 both Friday and Friday to lead 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone in that group that it is not over.
Do all you can tomorrow.
Be there and do everything in the right way.
It will not be until you find the points.
We have a goal, and you are striving to take it, and it is what we focus on.
I've already said this, I'm focusing on 12 players in our group, but we know exactly how much of this group -- the biggest players in the world."
Happy about the way his players play where it's hard to play, Bjorn has added: "I'll never finish this.
The game has been a draw.
The future will determine how each player will play, and that is different.
It is good to go out with a person when things are going well, but when you are alone, it is where you are fully tested as a golfer.
That is the message you need to pass to the players, doing all you can tomorrow.
Now, you leave the player or he or she behind and you have to go and do everything you can."
Unlike Bjorn, he and Jim Furyk will be watching his players play better alone than what happened, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who only got three points.
Furyk himself knew both the food and victory on the last day of the last minute, as he had already become part of the winning group in Brooklyn before he was killed when Europe "swallowed the lies in Medinah."
"I remember well," she always said when she was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, acted on her players when it was to be played the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but it would be nice to start with a high speed as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medinah.
When that noise and interest continues to go on, it puts great pressure on those games in the middle of the room.
We arranged our players according to that and put our players in the way we think, we'll be able to make a game tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to get back to the game and face Rory McIlroy in the previous game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper part of Europe.
"I'm going with this group this way because I think it's going to prepare the whole game," Bjorn said of the chosen players.
A German warship was remanded
A new type of German Navy vessel called frigate had to start operating in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era ships, but will not be there until the next year because of the systems and the cost of snowballs, local news reporters report.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz," the new captain of the Baden-Wuertemberg-class frigate, is now staged in the first half of 2019, says the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to join Navy in 2014, but the problems that followed the divergent brought about the future of a stable project.
The four Baden-Werttemberg-class ships were the only Navy since 2007 to take the position of the Bremen-Class ships.
It is understood that ships will have powerful predators, types of bombs that launch underground bombs and hidden ships and technology, such as the lack of space, infreded and angry engines.
Other important items put together include long periods of care that could not be used for new ships until two years later.
However, continuous departure means that the important development of warships - will give Germany the strength to go on - it will be wasted when it starts to work, says Die Zeit.
A f125-dead vessel appeared on ships last year, when Germany Navy refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohmbnase-Voss as the port of ships in Hamburg.
it was first that Navy restored the ship to which he was made after being carried.
Little is known about the reasons for the return of the ship, but German newsmen have found many important issues about the "software and hardware" that make the warship useless when sent to the war.
Software problems were especially important as the Baden-Werttemberg-class ships will be used by a 120-day crew - part of the ancient Bremen class ship crew.
It also appeared that the ship has a higher speed than what is necessary to reduce its operation also reduce the chances that the Navy will be able to put things forward in the future.
The 7,000th edition of "Rheinland-Pfalz" believes that it has twice the same size as the Germans used in World War II.
Apart from hardware problems, the entire budget of the project -- including training a team of pilots -- is a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1 million ($3.6bn) - from €2.2 million .
The problems of new ships are very important as there are recent warnings that the strength of the German naval has fallen.
At the beginning of that year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the Polish committee, admitted to the Navy that he was well "careful for the exit and entry of unusable ships."
The captain has been in trouble for some time, for the old ships are no longer working but are not working on ships instead.
Sorry, there are no Baden-Werttemberg-class ships that can join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the hidden life of relatives
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how animals use local food production.
It is believed that what will be found will give us a better understanding of the way these unusual creatures are living and will help us to direct future conservation activities.
A National Trust for Scotland scientific research will follow the usual growing pittrells as well as Daubenton animals with long ears in the Inverwee Gardens in West Ross.
Special records will be placed in some places to examine the activities of farmers throughout the year.
NHS personnel and volunteers will conduct small inspections using manual-handed monitors.
A sound scientific review of all records will show the origin of the birds ’ cries and what certain animals do.
The map of the locations and reports will be published to build a detailed picture of the area in which they live.
Rob Dewar, an environmental adviser to the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important to animals and how these animals are used.
This information will help you to see the benefits of local management activities such as the field creation and the best way to preserve forest areas and other animals related to them.
The animals in Scotland and throughout the UK have been banned throughout the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and construction of buildings that affect their habitat and their loss.
High - powered and fire - resistant machines can pose a danger, and the paper can regularly kill airplanes and building maintenance plants, as well as the attack on damaged walls.
Animals are not really invisible.
However, as they do at night, their ears are much more active than their eyes if they feed the animal.
They use a complex ability to hear where the heat comes from in order to find animals and objects in the areas where they fly.
The NTS, which oversees more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important squares and 76,000 hectares throughout the world, considers them to be important animals.
He has ten trained experts, who regularly do research, examine where he lives and how to protect them.
The association also arranged for the first Scottish explorer to be the sole of the animals in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight species of Scotland’s ten species.
The location's manager David Thompson says it's a nice place to stay.
"Here in the Treave is the best place for the neighbors," he said.
"We have old buildings, many large trees and other suitable places.
But there is much about animals we don't know, so the work we do here and in other buildings will help us understand more about what they don't need to live."
He stresses the importance of examining whether there are animals before working in buildings because it is possible that cutting down their single habitat could kill about 400 female and female animals, almost all of them living in that area.
Animals are protected and the law does not allow them to be killed, tortured, or abused or destroyed in their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scotlandn president of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the community to help you.
He said, "There are many things that we should learn from our relatives, and many of our relatives don't know what they are doing to keep living."
Ronaldo refuses to complain as lawyers arrange to pay for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo speaks of the surprises that he has even said "false news," saying people "will want to improve themselves" using his name.
His agents arranged to pay for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which he published.
This Portuguese player and Juventus are also admired by American actress Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is reported that he has paid $375,000 to close his mouth on this condition, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video with 142 million followers after the reports were reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, quoted the reports as "false stories."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they're saying today is false news," says a fifth-time balloon of Ballon d'Or in the camera.
"They try to build a name by using a local name.
It is normal.
They want me to speak in my name, but it is part of the work.
I'm happy and everything is good for me," adds the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's agents are preparing to pay Dr. Spiegel for these taxes, calling themselves "an unacceptable report of taxes affecting personal life," says Reuters.
Justice Christian Schertz said the player will want money back "to be destroyed by his reputation equal to the size of the accused, probably the most tragic loss of a person's rights recently."
This situation is reported to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga were told to return to the player’s room, where he was called to visit, in accordance with the paper posted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Maiorga says Ronaldo fell in love after the incident and told him that "he's a ready person" "99 percent" with errors "one percent."
The documents said Ronaldo allowed them to sleep on both sides, but they agreed.
Mayorga also admitted to the police and took pictures of them being taken to the hospital, but later she admitted that the case could not be dealt with without the court because she felt "he was afraid to repeat himself" and worried about "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old girl says she now wants to break the agreement as she continues to be affected by what is said.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the report, and this year he moved to a large Italian group of Juves to a $100 million agreement.
Brexit: The UK 'will always be sorry' for the loss of car owners
The UK "will always be sorry" if not lost its role as world leader at the beginning of cars after Brexit, says the Business No.
He also added that "is worrying" that Toyota UK tells the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU outside the agreement it will temporarily set up a production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese designer said that the effect of drinking on the border when the agreement with Brazil failed to create the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston industry - which made Auris and Aventis of Toyota - produced some 150,000 cars last year and 90% were sent to other European Union countries.
"I think that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March the product will stand in our store," says Marvin Cooke, the top-ranking director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have purchased from the EU without an agreement on how to negotiate with other countries to work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it's going to close its Oxford Mining factory a month ago in Brexit.
Concerns mainly relate to what car designers call a danger if Brexit agreements are not implemented.
Toyota's production is carried out "on the need of that time", the parts of the vehicles arrive every 37 minutes from both UK and EU vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, there may be obstacles to the industry that could lead to the production and completion of parts of the vehicle construction.
It is impossible for Toyota to catch more than a day cars built in their Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the product may need to be fixed.
Mr. Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers' future cooperation with the EU "is carefully adjusted to avoid this border investigation."
"We need a deal. We want to get the best deal we can afford as not only the success we will now enjoy but if we take this opportunity," says the Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence that comes not only from Toyota but also from other industries is that we need to be fully able to carry on with what the fear of the sufferer is currently successful."
Toyota could not mean how long the product will be fixed, but in time, it warns that adding costs will reduce the performance of the industry and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked for Burnaston for 24 years and who is a link to the U.S. youth industry, says his worried members: "On what I have seen when the work is done again.
A government speaker says, "We have set a clear and reliable agenda for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump and Rosenstein convention may be drinking again, says the White House
A conference held in the head of Donald Trump and a general representative of Rod Rosenstein could be "studyed in another week" as the war of the Supreme Court and the establishment of Brett Kavanaugh continues, says the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines Russia's electoral distortions, the link between Trump and Russia and the possible violations of justice from the president.
Whether Trump will remove the general minister's ring, thereby endangering Mueller's freedom, has given Washington news that won't be discussed for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had a conversation about the use of a cell phone to secure talks with Trump and the president's 25th birthday.
Rosenstein, a former member of the U.S.A.
But in the past, you went to the White House, even though there's reports that you're going to leave the job.
Instead, meeting Trump, then the United Nations in New York, was announced to be on Thursday.
Trump says "you call" not to listen to Rosenstein, but the meeting started with a view to avoiding questioning the Senate's court case where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of stealing, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both became witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered that there be a one-week FBI survey against Kavanaugh, which further reduced the full vote of the Senate.
Written by Trump's story, Sarah Sanders, and came from Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she says: "The day of the appointment, it may be in this week, I think that it will be celebrated in one week as there are other things that go on and the high court.
But we will see and love the keeping of news."
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders has never had a press conference in White House since 10 September.
Administrator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the decline of these meetings is not due to the fact that the media "love to talk," although he said, "I will never deny the truth that they speak."
Then you show that the connection between Trump and the news will be multiple.
"The president made the machines more questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, adding, without showing evidence: "We've looked at the number."
There will be meetings, says Sanders, but "if the media have an opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that is better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that many times and we've seen us do a lot in the past few weeks and it's gonna take the position of a press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually listens to questions when coming out of the White House or when he participates in public machinery or news sources and respected visitors.
It is not unusual for him to ask questions when he is alone.
New York in this week the president has probably shown why, without any news, sometimes by speaking indistinctly in front of the press.
Health writer writing to EU officials in the NHS in Scotland about the fear of Brazil
The Health Letter has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to show their appreciation for the world's wishes to live in post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter 6 months before the UK joined the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the necessary costs of EU citizens’ requests for public assistance.
In his book, Nksz Freeman wrote: "Tomorrow, discussions between the UK and the EU have continued, looking at the decisions expected in this hands.
But the UK also continues to provide its arrangements for non-agreement.
I know that this may not be the time for you all.
That is why I want to emphasize now how I appreciate the work done by all the members of the staff, no matter where they are from.
Our brothers from the EU, as well as in other places, have brought with them a valuable pill and skills that strengthen and improve the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christy Abercrombie Gets Reproached After Headache
The tennis player of Tennessee State Tigers Christy Abercrombie has been quickly treated after the head injury of the Decision when they were split 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennesse State trainer Rod Reed told reporters that injury occurred just before the funeral.
"When he came to the bathroom he fell down suddenly," said Reed.
Doctors and doctors gave Abercrombie health on the bench before putting her in the stretcher and taking her back to check on her.
The president of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had finished treatment at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no data on the present type of injury/major injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.

Buyers from other countries will be paid cash at the time of the funeral when they buy a house in the UK
Buyers in other countries will be paid cash during the group’s purchase of a UK house so that this money is used to assist those who do not have a place to stay under the new Tory schemes
This will make it difficult for Corbyn to find young people to vote
The increase in the membership will be required for those who do not have the right to participate in the UK
Money is expected to earn about £120 million a year to help homeless people
Buyers from other countries will be paid more than the company's money if they buy a house in the UK - this money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will today announce.
This will be seen as an effort to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in an effort to attract new people to volunteer to find more expensive houses and to look at people who manage a lot of money.
The removal of the fund will work for people and non-profit businesses in the UK, and this budget will help the Government to eliminate homeless people.
This income - contributing to the current fund of the group, including high - level levies placed two years ago in second - and - third - largest homes.
No one expects this to give them about £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of London’s newly built houses have been purchased by non-UK citizens, increasing numbers and making it difficult for beginners to find houses.
Many of the rich in this city - especially the capital - have become "citys that cry out" because of the high number of buyers from other countries who spend most of their time not in this country.
A new goal came a few weeks later, Boris Johnson spoke of a reduction in the group’s income so that more young people could get the first houses.
He ordered businesses to build up high-quality buildings by taking the construction site and not using it, and asked Nkz May to close the boxes to buy houses in order to repair Britain's "house pollution".
Mnu Corbyn is a campaign promoter for the proposed change in houses, including control of savings and removal from the house "unavoidable".
He also wants to give more energy to build new homes.
Nukkz May says: "Last year I said that I would devote myself to raising the dream of Britain -- that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing the sale of houses.
Britain will always be willing to accept people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it would not be easy for non-EU peoples, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses rather than British hard workers.
For many are those who dream of a house that shall not be reached, and there is no shame in sleeping on the street.
Jack Ross: 'My greatest wish is to be a Scotlandn trainer'
Sunderland's manager Jack Ross says "a great desire" to be Scotland's trainer one day.
Ross, 42 years old, wants the challenge of helping the North-East group, now the third in League One, is left with three points by the upper group.
He moves to the Stadium of Light in this way after helping St. Mirren return to Scottish Premiership in the past.
"I wanted to play my country as a player.
I got the B cap and so on," Ross tells BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden many times and my father was young, and this was what I thought.
I can only get that opportunity, however, if I succeed as a small team trainer."
The pre-Ross trainers in Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Ross, an Alloa Athletic trainer, said he was not afraid to come after the major trainers in this large group, as he rejected requests from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"Thanks to me as I am now asked, 'Can I bring this group back to Premier League?'
Because of the creation and development of the group, it is no doubt due to the Premier League," he said.
"It's okay if I repeat it, but I'll probably see myself as a success where I can bring this group back."
Ross is only three years old as a trainer, after a short time as a trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months as a trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa get out of the house, and he turned St. Mirren, who was almost eaten by a champion of the Championship next summer.
And Ross says he feels more confident than he is now a player in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"The things have changed completely," he recalls, training Alloa.
"I was absolutely sure that the training work was worth it, more than the player.
It seems unreasonable because I played well, lived a good life, and had fun.
But playing is not easy.
There are many things you should do every week.
Even now I do those things when it is known that stress and stress are at work, but I like training.
For a long time I wanted to train, and now I can do it, I feel that I am now doing what I want to do with my life as an elder."

The best time for pint is 5.30pm in the end, i.e. the test
The entry of the type covered Britain’s hard - pressed pipes but heavily loaded food stores.
The coffee and beer groups were driven by 2.7 per cent on July - but in the food stores by 4.8 per cent, the figures say.
Peter Martin, a business consultancy CGA, who is the leader of these figures, says: "The continued success and participation of England for a long time is expected for the World Cup means that July follows the same way as the month before June, when the pages rise by 2.8 percent, unless the food stores fall below.
Breaking by 1.8 percent in food stores in June has been very bad in July.
Drinking pills and beer are more expensive than restaurants.
Peasants carry food that is heavy to the sun, even though it is not as bad as food stores.
It seems that people simply wanted to get drunk.
The consumption of tobacco and tobacco increased by 6.6 per cent this month, by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, an editor of the joys and acceptance of the RSM visitors, says: "These results continue as we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effect of major events or sports events will always be a powerful reason when it comes to marketing.
It is not surprising that food stores continue to push hard, although sales of 4.8 percent a year will be painful despite ongoing cost problems.
The long-term nature of the fire is very bad in food shops and in time it will be evident that the low temperatures we have in August will give us what we need."
The increase in paper sales and food stores, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent on July, which showed a decrease in the number of bars.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitor for the sale of paper, paper and food stores, collects and updates the working data of 47 working groups, produces more than £9 million, and is the beginning of a progressive business.
One out of five children have secret accounts in the communication centers they have hidden their parents
One of the five children - 11 years of age - a secret account in the communication centers that hid their parents and teachers, showing the experience
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in "false Insta" pages
News generates anxiety about the sending of gifts of mercy
20 percent of people who have "nothin'" accounts show children
One of the five children - 11 years of age - opens up the accounts of the communication centers that hid the elderly.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed rapid growth in the "false Insta" accounts - which refers to the fact that the Instagram images are sent.
News has created a fear of being sent to charity.
Twenty percent of those who say using a clean account show their parents, while they have other secrets.
One mother who somehow saw the secret of her 13-year-old daughter found a young woman asking others to "bless her."
This study, of the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC), found 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years of age with two profiles, their share agrees that they have a secret account.
HMC's manager Mike Buchanan says: "It's disturbing that so many young people are tempted to set up online accounts where parents and teachers will not find them."
Elid Doyle will be "player's voice" on the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle was selected by the Scottish Athletics board as the director of the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a Scottish favorite player and poet Ian Beattie described this as a good opportunity for those who lead a game to win his large prize in games that include other countries over the past ten years.
"Eidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and all players in the world and we are confident that the Scottish games will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board," said Beattie.
Doyle says, "I'm determined to be the voice of the players and I hope to give a lot of attention and help in directing the games in Scotland."
This American player, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta between his four Olympics and now an ordinary BBC scientist, finds it impossible to walk after the death of the road (TIA).
He wrote to Twitter: "It was almost yesterday that I died.
I failed to walk.
Doctors say that it will appear to me in time to determine whether I will improve or how much.
It was a moment of horror but was completely right, and I learned to walk, and today I am ashamed of myself!
Thank you for the instructions to encourage me!"
The advertising of mother-in-laws is based on the Internet
A company that pumps eggs has made a difference over the Internet using a similar approach to breastfeeding mothers and breast-feeding dogs.
To mark the introduction of what is said to be "the first-fashioned pair of balls in the world," Elvie's company publishes a video advertising of a destructive song to show freedom the new pair that gives a mother who offers them.
"Yes, I swear, but you don't see a fool" and say "If you don't see this isn't a dog, my balls."
And the lord said unto the servant, Bring it out; and, behold, the half of my friends shall be with me, and I will give them their portion, and their portion shall be with me.
However, this promotion, published on the company’s Facebook page, has created a problem online.
The 77,000-year-old levies who have been seen by hundreds of authorities have received opinions similar to those of viewers, when many say they look down on the "hard" of the drug industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cattle to advertise the product.
As they need to be born and born to produce milk, unless their children are taken after a few days of birth," writes another.
Elvie's brain pump is hidden inside the breastbone (Elvie/Mother)
One says, "It's a difficult situation for both mother and mother.
But why do you not rather let yourselves be defrauded, seeing your mother has become a prostitute?"
One said, "This speech isn't appropriate."
Some protected this announcement, one woman admitted to finding a song "a joke."
"I think this is a good idea.
I would buy it if I wanted to.
Smoking made me feel as if I were a horse.
The announcement was very touching but I heard what we understood.
This product will be a real help," writes one.
One commented: "This advertising is fun and refers to the pumping mothers (usually at work or in private homes) and feel "like dogs."
This is not a advertising campaign that honors or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the stand-up group shows that they have already danced under their breasts.
The aim of the campaign is to promote the idea that many women who use breast - feeding say that they feel like bullies.
But Elvie Pump, with no anger, has no ropes or shoes and wears it hidden under the breast of the breast, gives women the freedom to touch, carries their children, and takes them out.
Ana Balarin, a mother's ECD, has noted: "Elvie Pump is a product that will be very involved and so you deserve the clear way to publish it.
By comparing women with bulls we want to put the bones and all their problems on the public side, while showing in a way that we are happy and understanding the feeling of liberation from the new dust that will bring it to us.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has been questioned.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children came from the catwalk of designer Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Grandparents peacefully move to a camp near Texas
The number of unaccompanied children has increased even if it has not changed the number of months they have passed through the border, partly because the police have not established the Trump office made it difficult to provide children with support.
Often, many supporters become paper - free guests, and they have been afraid to seize their opportunity to live in this area by expressing themselves as a parent.
The danger is serious in June, when authorities announce that supporters and other members of the elderly at home will have to send the fingerprints, and that the data will be given to the arrival authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, Head of Immigration and Customs Force, admitted before Congress that this scientist has arrested many people who wrote to support children without parents.
The scientist later admitted that 70 percent of those imprisoned were not guilty of crime.
"Some 80 percent of people who do not support themselves or family members are illegally involved in this, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we keep looking for those people," said Mr. Albence.
Wanting to promulgate children quickly, the authorities have introduced new laws that will require some of them to appear in court during the month, not after 60 days, which were in advance, in accordance with the staff of the Shelter.
Many will come from the door of the videocassette, not literally, to ask for legal rights in the audience.
Those considered inappropriate will soon be rewarded.
If children stay in prison for a long time, there are many opportunities to be worried or depressed, which can lead to or to try to escape, in accordance with the Shelter workers and reports published from the studio last month.
Officials say this concern is growing in a much more complex than in Tornillo, where signs of a child’s heavy burden may not be considered, due to the size of the place.
They also add that taking the children to the city of the tent without giving them time to prepare themselves emotionally or to criticize friends can lead to many problems that already exist.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkey's 'stolen' troops that they're coming soon
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Government Walid al-Moulam speaks to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in their country is now its eighth year.
Moulalem, who also became the champion of the great empire, says Syrian troops illegally, that they will end terrorism, and "they will be dealt with in the right way."
"You have to go immediately without questions," he said to the audience.
Moulalem insists that "war against terrorism is about to end" in Syria, when more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes.
Damascus says it will continue "to fight this holy war and cleanse the whole area of Syria" in dangerous groups as well as "any person from another country."
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, focusing on training and guidance of Kurdish and Syrian Arab troops in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers who do not share the country’s view of war.
As for refugees, Moulalem says conditions allow them to return, and he calls "some Western countries" "may be afraid" so that refugees can return.
He said, "We have spoken to the international community and to the people, that they should make sure that the refugees are returned."
"They run a political issue that should not be brought only to the welfare of the people."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not help Syria again until a political agreement was reached between Assad and those who opposed the end of the war.
UN urges that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a border on the opposition of its last leader, Idlib, is an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevents the massive attacks by the Syrian army supported by Russia in the country, where three million people live.
But Moulalem points out that the agreement "was set a clear time" and hopes that soldiers would attack the Jaguadists and Nustra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, "will be defeated."
The UN candidate Stefan de Mistura believes that he will soon arrange for the first meetings of the new committee that include the government and opposition members to write a bill after the Syrian war and review the way of election.
Moulalem sets limits on the participation of the Syrian government in the committees, saying that the panel's work should be kept "by looking at the new constitution articles," and warned of the movement.
Why should Trump try to resuscitate the second option
In that sense, Mr. Trump can win a second election in 2020 unless, as many non-smokers may wish to be, unfaithful and wrong-doing instead of president.
There is no doubt that "It will be the most historic end in the history of the president!"
Until now, there are no signs that overseers are no longer concerned with this matter.
Since 2014, CNN viewers have again become 1.05 million and MSNBC viewers have tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News is often with 2.4 million viewers, ranging from 1.7 million in the last four years, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "Rachel Maddow Show" to many 3.5 million viewers in hot night news.
"People are afraid to know because it is not something we understand," says Neal Baer, the director of the ABC drama program called "Designed Survivor," which relates to the cabinet secretary who became the president after the attack under the Capitol.
Neil Scowell, who is red in the field of writing and publishing songs called "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another view.
He remembered a box in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked.
"You said, "You're kidding me," said Nksz. Scowell.
It is a pleasure to listen to and observe these parts.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether or not the families of arrivals return and have a global economic situation.
Few people are aware of these facts.
And yet, more than a familiar citizen if he finds himself sitting for over six hours watching a panel of science contesting the use of Bob Woodward's "deep background" source in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's hairdresser called $15,000 ("the most powerful garment," says Washington Post) and the explicit words of St.
I, just, will not look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Some of the things he does make it seem like it's a life-saving program that always gives something at night," said Brent Montgomery, director of the Wellhouse Entertainment and founder of the "Pown Stars," talking about the transformation of the Trump system and everyday rounds (in exchange with N.F.L., commending Kim Jong-un).

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, he was hot at 80 degrees outside his home in the north corner of Kauai, but he was in the house overlooking the MSNBC that had recorded the CNN.
It did not allow him to leave, as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember in old times we do all these exciting things and people say, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought she was reading it, but it seems they were real."

Money changers are placed in the middle of the House's runtime
It is not surprising that for the 17th and 17th centuries there are financial losses, due to the re-establishment of congresses from two leaders in competition with the same party.
This newly revised Pittsburgh reader is represented by Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another special election tomorrow year.
The Lamb is running along another continent, the Republican Keith Rothfus, now representing the older territory of the 12 Pennsylvania area, which is full of 17 young people.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that older students violated the law by going to the Republican.
The movement of this 17-year-old has resulted in the flow of money between the large group's funds, the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamb appeared in Pennsylvania after winning a special election by March, which was attended by many people of Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That position was signed by the Republican over ten years ago, President Donald Trump won the prize with 20 points.
Politicians gave the Democrats a measure of opportunity.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador on behalf of China, becoming a fan
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already noted Beijing, with a small invitation from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a free meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and became a hotel in Panama until we removed the Trump Organization Steering Group.
The Heads of the State Department decide to call again the American diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "a later decision not to work with Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, who spoke at the door, at the beginning of this month.
But only El Salvador, with $140 million, is paid by helping America in 2017, and by managing drugs, promoting and supporting the economy.
The proposed payment, which includes the financial limitation and the allocation of visa restrictions, may have caused the country of Central America to suffer from increased unemployment and death.
As their meetings progressed, North American and Central America’s presidents reduced high incomes focused on protecting and promoting the economy to follow the same association last year that was considered a step forward in the attempt to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But during September, the chief executives made it clear that they wanted the capital to move forward, effectively completing any idea of El Salvador payment.
President Mike Pence's jealousy should now be able to speak with the dead, now scheduled to be in mid-October, as a sign brought by the rulers at this meeting, the officials say.
And three American representatives returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strong messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's White House's speech was refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three United States officials, including two envoys, who agreed to discuss the internal intentions of the secret.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external auditor who is closely related to the administrator and spoke of the confidentiality condition.
A Lesson in History
The following scenario may be a report of Robert Mueller's special adviser against Mr. Trump's justice, and now there's evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is said to be claiming that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in his efforts to attack our election.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will be able to handle the cases in this panel, as he is preparing to stand before the vote, and perhaps eventually before the trial.
This has many questions, and even Mr. Trump’s defeat will certainly happen to his or her brothers in Europe.
There are decisions we both have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the debate.
In 1938, the German authorities were ready to set up a cup d'état against Hitler, if only the West was against him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History will face such situations, and endless efforts to combat the will of many have proved to be stronger or less successful over the years.
The Americans have faced many of these challenges now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump attacked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controlled Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein was still in the trouble of this paper reporting that, last year, he suggested that the president report immediately and spoke about his failure to do his job.
Mr. Rosenstein says the issue of The Times is not valid.
"How will we react if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unjust - or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite the charges of blasphemy and lying?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of Congress to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do so, the desire of many will not last long.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish from Czechoslovakia who had been exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ruled over my area.
He survived, moved to America, and, after 60 years, he sent me to light the streets on Saturdays in a swastika river.
How can I, being absent, be present with such confidence in my flesh for the coming of the Lord?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers hopes as the game nears Rapid Vienna
Rangers play at home with Rapid Vienna on Monday, knowing that winning the Austrians, after playing equally in Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good time to pass through the Group G of Europe League.
The damage on the floor prevented the player Graham Dorrans from rehearsing for the first time until playing equal to 2 and Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use those consequences to advance the big things.
"It's good to get this point because Villarreal is a good game group," said the 31-year-old player.
"We're going to this game believe we're going to come back with someone and we got a point.
We may eventually find a ball, but, besides, playing equally is good.
They played better than we did in the first and the second.
On Thursday, we play another European game.
We hope that we will find three points but it will be a hard game because they play well in the past but, because our followers will encourage us, I am sure we will play and have good results.
The past year has been difficult, including all that has been done by my injury and changes in the team itself, but it seems that things are going well now.
A good team and players are happy; he is also happy when we are trained.
We hope that we will work now, beyond what happens in the past, and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because they are afraid of financial problems
Despite having a clear view of how they want to care for them, few people spoke to their families about it.
Nearly half of the people in the United States say that they talk to their mates about the long - term expenses of care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to take care of a family member, but they don't take the steps to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, the director's director of the life insurance company Noonwide.
Let us begin.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not share your wishes.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss how and where you will be cared for, for such decisions can have a great impact on your view of expenses.
Consider your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you to pay those expenses.
Your long - term financial decisions may include a long - term insurance policy, a life insurance policy if you plan to pay for these expenses or become a health insurance policy only if you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Prevent legal battles.
Look for a health - care professional so that you can make sure that someone you trust will take care of your treatment and make sure that doctors cooperate with your wishes if you are not able to speak.
Also, consider the power of attorney in your money.
You will choose someone you trust to make decisions about your money and make sure that your expenses are paid if you are not able to do anything.
Don’t forget the details: Think of your elderly parent being exposed to an urgent health situation and being rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and drugs?
Write down those details in order to prepare for that situation.
"Not only are the money to be seen, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What drugs?
Who will care for the flock?

Rescan several air-fowls in Ilfracombe
Several times it is sprayed with air rifles as he goes home after he leaves at night.
He was in Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, at the time he was released from the bush, in the back and in the hand.
The police described the explosion, which occurred about 02:30 BST, "as an unexpected situation."
The victim did not see the attacker.
The police spoke to the witnesses at least once a year.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by earthquakes and tsunamis in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the officials say the number of the dead is expected to survive.
Since the connections are not working, relief personnel could not obtain data from the authorities of Dongga, the north-eastern area of Paul near the centre of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were arrested after the attacks.
Here are some important facts about Palo and Donggar, on the island of Sulaves:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, the easternmost part of the island of Sulawesi, and has a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city had been fighting for 40 years while attacking tsunamis.
Dongga is over 300 km (180 metres) west of the island of Sulawes.
This area, a region under the state, was some 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and farming are ways of life in the central Sulawesi region, especially in the eastern part of the Donggar region.
The coins of the money changers are also important in this regard, which are found in much of Morouli, in the province of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggar have been attacked several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggar.
The tsunami also struck the west of Donggar in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is a prosperous Pacific Ring of Fire and is often attacked by earthquakes.
Here are some areas that have been attacked by major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
In 2004: A massive earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh north of Sumatra in Dec. 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killed 226,000 people near the Indian Ocean, and more than half of Aceh.
In 2005: The next earthquake struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March to the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Island, which is north of Sumatra.
In 2006: The 6.8 magnitude attacked southern Java, the largest island in Indonesia, created a tsunami that hit the south, killed about 700 people.
In 2009: The 7.6 magnitude of the earthquake attacked near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
In 2010: The 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, in Sumatra, a tsunami of about 10 metres below most of the areas killed 300 people.
In 2016: A small earthquake struck Pidie Jaya in Aceh, struck down and caused people to be afraid of the worst tsunamis in 2004 and tsunamis.
There are no tsunamis in this area, but over 100 people have been killed by destroyed buildings.
In 2018: A powerful earthquake struck an Indonesian island in Lombok, killing more than 500 people, especially the northern part of the island.
This attack destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of homeless visitors behind.
Old Sarah Palin's son is in prison for domestic play
Track Palin, an old former Alaskan prince's son and the candidacy of President Sarah Palin's jealousy, has been imprisoned on torture.
Palin, 29 years old, from Vasilla, Alaska, has been arrested for crimes against him, to disrupt the report of the riot and the arrest, in accordance with a report published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a woman was in a relationship with him trying to call the police to report this crime, she phoned him.
Palin is imprisoned in the Mat-Su Pretreal Facility and is charged with an insecure deposit of $500, reports KTUU.
He has come to court on Judgment, where he says "accused, certainly" when asked, reports this and the network.
Palin faces three sides of Class A, which means that he may be taken a year and paid $250,000.
On behalf of Class B, this day will be paid at $2,000.
Don't start when Palin gets involved in criminal matters.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report this action.
This case is currently under the Veteran's Alaska Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, of violating the domestic law, and of having a gun at the time of arrest regarding the situation.
His daughter was riding a bicycle in front of him.
Sarah Palin was criticized by expert groups in 2016 after her son’s actions related to the PTSD performed by his Iraqi job.
The earthquake of tsunamis in Indonesia: killing many people
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the island of Indonesia on Friday.
This is a 7.5 degree earthquake that created tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Wireless networks and communications are not working, and the number of deaths can slow down in the next days.
This earthquake hit the central part of the northeastern Saudi city of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
There are videos that people send to the communication center showing what happened.
There were hundreds of people gathered at the bus station in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the south.
Government persecutors seek an unusual death sentence for the terrorist in NYC
Government officials in New York seek the death sentence of Sayfullo Saipov, a New York City terrorist who kills eight people -- an unusual sentence that has never been sent to this crime scene since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, was said to use a home Depot-controlled game to attack West Side Highway bicycles in Lower Manhattan, killing people walking on foot and riding bicycles in that way on Oct.
In order to make him executed, the persecutors would have to show that Saipov had been beaten by eight people and that "immoral" had seriously injured them physically, according to the report of an attempt to obtain a death sentence, issued by the Southern District of New York.
Both of these actions call for the execution of a death sentence, in accordance with a court document.
After a few weeks, the court of inquiry brought Saipov 22 cases involving eight deaths, usually used by government perpetrators on criminally organized fronts, and the murder and car arrest.
The attack needed "good planning and thinking," the attackers said, explaining how Saipov did "bad, cruel and shocking."
"U-Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov ulimaz, killed all of his fellow citizens, Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," said a sadistic report.
Five killed were Argentina’s visitors.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York, where the death penalty has been suspended.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug workers but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The time for the execution of the death sentence on New York was 1953 in July and Ethel Rosenberg, married people who were killed after being convicted of joining the Soviet Union were informed between Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, shows that he has no heart in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the prosecutors that he felt good about what he had done, that is, the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had done this to watch the ISIS videos in his mouth, in line with the words he spoke on the street.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be put in his hospital room, the police say.
And he had a bar on his shoulders, and he measured the length of his steps, twenty-two cubits.
David Patton, a public defender representing Saipov, says they're "expected as expected" by a court decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence is better than to accept an application for release from prison without an opportunity to be released will only make it easier for all involved to be shocked," Patton said.
The Saipov Protection Group advised the persecutors not to want a death sentence.
Tory's government says Nigel Farage should direct talks with Brazil
Nigel Farage promised to 'organize the armed forces' today during the battle in the valley of Tory.
Ukip's political leader said that Eurosceptics needed to be "simply" - as one of Theresa May's government said it should be the EU speaker.
A member of the parliament, Peter Bone, told the press in Birmingham that the UK 'will be out' now if Mr. Farage was a British Secretary.
But the challenge Nkz May faced in bringing together members of his separate group was noted by the senior members of Tory to join a different movement against Brexit in the city.
The Chief fails to maintain his Chequers' recovery program in spite of the attacks by the members of Brazil, the Remainer and the EU.
Other members insisted that he would continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the conflict - and urged the Eurosceptics and Labor to choose between his passport and his "signature".
Mnu Bone reported a Leave Actions Leave Leave in Solidhull that you want to 'end by Chequers'.
Mr. Farage said he should have been made a chair and given a job to talk to Brussels.
He said, "If you were the only one who touched me, you would now be released," he said.
The Wellingborough Government has added: 'I will stand up for Brexit but we need to finish the Chequers.'
Describing his disagreement with the EU, he says, "We have never fought the world's wars to become slaves.
We desire to keep the commandments which we have received from us.
Mr. Bone comments that the public view has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The view that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay out of the truth.'
Andrea Jenkyns of Tory, who supports Brexit, said to the artists, "I mean, I'm great, listen to people.
'People don't want Chequers, the opposition group won't vote, our group doesn't want us to see them on the streets and make us welcome first.
Please forget about Chequers and start listening.'
And at the command of the governor, when he came to the judgment, he said unto them, The magistrates have sent to do the work, as they have said.
Mr Farage told the government on the bill that they must be 'pressed' if they forget the decisions they made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of loyalty between us - people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to be unfaithful to Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to stop doing that."
In a strong order he told the crowd, "I want to make political parties, now in the Brazilian populace, feel stressed.
"We are using the forces of the people of this world that have given us the victory over Brazil and will not end our power and become a country of independence, self-government, the United Kingdom."
Still, the Remainers sailed to Birmingham before having a two - hour stay in the city.
The main drivers carried the Tories Against Brexit after the group was established in this week.
Labor member Lord Adonis made a list of Conservatives about the security problems they had with the group app when the feed was opened.
'These people who tell us they can put the IT systems and all Canada's technology and other, the problem-free borders, trade-free exchanges without borders and Ireland,' he added.
'It's completely destroyed.
There's nothing called nice Brexit,' he said.
Warren's 'visual' settings for the president' option
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says "to look at the president's election" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that this Massachusetts Democrat talks about its future at the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who lived indicted President Donald Trump, made the election again in November against the GOP Rep. of the world’s Geoff Diehl, who was the founder of Trump’s charity in the 2016 Massachusetts speech.
It was a great opportunity to communicate with Trump in 2020.
The Judgment of the Holyoke evening became his 36th meeting using the city hall since Trump became president.
The attendee asked whether he was planning to enter the selection.
Warren replied that it is now time for "women to go to Washington to improve our corrupt government, and that includes a woman who will be president."
The popular LSU player has killed Sims
The baton Rouge police, in La., announced to her indicted prisoner that he was killed by a basketball player who listened to LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested in the morning.
He released a video showing this on Friday, asking for help explaining the man who appeared in the video.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was executed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims is shot in the head and finally died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters about the Conclusion, the 247sports.
Wade says he's protecting his friend and then Simpson's gone.
Simpson was interrogated and agreed that he was there, that he was carrying a gun, and that he had killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trial and was imprisoned at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6-year-old boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games starting 10 times in the summer last 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is near to get a clean earth after following the team's guidance that defeated Sebastian Vettel
It became clear when Walter Bottas succeeded Lewis Hamilton in deciding that Mercedes Group's leadership would play a major role in this competition.
From the outset, Bottas began well and almost agreed with Hamilton as he protected his place in the first two camps and invited Vettel to attack a member of his group.
Vettel first went to the pits and left Hamilton to be protected by cars in the gang, something to be decided on.
Mercedes came to the pit after the rotation and became behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead of the train that caused Ferrari's driver to be forced to leave within two years of protecting the third ship.
Max Verstappen started at the back of the grid and became the seventh at the end of the first cycle on his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the competition as he continued with his guards to interfere with the immediate end and passed Kimi Raikkonen on to fourth.
He finally reached the piss in the 44th round but could not raise his japanese in the eight remaining rounds as Raikkonen took the fourth.
A hard day because Walter did a good job every week and was kind and kind to me.
The group has done a commendable job to have 1-2," says Hamilton.
The Motivation of His Body
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein in the conclusion statement as he insisted that he did not show someone a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court of Britt Kavanaugh of torture.
Speaking in a West Virginia poll, the president did not speak directly of the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee, but noted that what happened to the Senate showed that people were "unthinkable and unmerciful and unfaithful."
"One thing that can continue to happen a good thing a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and unkind and unfaithful," he said.
"When you look at the broken news and say "oh, I didn't do it.
I couldn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, is there a file?
You remember his answer... there's someone who sent this document-- "oh, oh, me?
Oh, Dad.
I didn't send a man."
Well, wait a minute.
There's someone we've sent...No, no one's sent," he says, referring to the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter with details about Kavanaugh's accusation by Ford back in July, and came from early September - but Feinstein objected that the document was issued from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's complaints, I didn't send someone," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as soon as I asked."
But his opposition didn't sound well to the president, who noted during the Night's Final Meeting: "What I can't say, the movement of his body is rich.
It may not be that he has done it, but the rejoicing of his body has been rich."
Continued to protect the Supreme Court prosecutor, accused by three women in a complaint, the president said Democrats used the charges for their profits.
"He's not willing to fight for power in anything he can do.
You see a lack of kindness, lack of concern, no matter who's hurt, that they should pass by who to help and control," the Mediate reported in the president's statement.
Ye-Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer spent two Giants playing with Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned powerful after the fifth hit on the Elite League with Belfast Giant by winning the next 5-3 game in Dundee on the Final.
The Giants received two golfers at the beginning of the game by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the weight of the team that played at home before Dwyer played the third Ginants.
François Bouchard sailed the Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen rode two golfers to win the game.
This was the third of Adam Keefe's group being eaten at Elite League this afternoon, since they have been reimbursed on Friday night to defeat Dundee on 2-1 in Belfast.
These groups were assembled fourth in the day, and the Giants won three games last.
The first Dwyer's ball went into the fourth minute at 3:35 when the ball was loaded from Candall McFaull, when David Rutherford put the ball while Beauvillier hit the second ball after four minutes.
In a game of many years earlier, Sullivan gave hope to a group that played at home at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt sent a ball to Cownie when he played it at 15:16.
Dwyer has made sure that the Giants are moving forward when they are thrown into the kitchen when he hits his second ball that day at the end of the first ball.
The team that played at home was strong again and Bouchard replayed a good match at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have met to help Nielsen ride the Dondee's first move to the game at the end of the second round and make sure they win the game by the fifth game if you finish the game.
The Giants, now in their last four five games, play at home with Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A pilot dies so that hundreds of people escape from the earth’s atmosphere
The Indonesian air traffic controller is praised after his death to ensure that a large number of passengers arrive safely below.
More than 800 people have died and many have not been found after the great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which started tsunamis.
There is strong motivation to continue to attack this place and many have lost two of them in the city of Palu.
But even though their brothers had fled to escape, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave work in a building that was under the control of Mutara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the Palu province.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, on the way, would be able to leave safely.

Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one person is missing after a low-level plane crash
The airline leading up to the Pacif lagoon in Micronesia now says that there is only one person missing, after all 47 passengers and flight crew are safely hidden in a heavy plane.
Air Niugini has been on Saturday morning, it will not be able to tell the story of a man-man-man pilot.
The airline says it works with local authorities, hospitals, and nurses to try to find the nest.
The airline did not respond immediately when it was asked to reveal details about this passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships help other passengers and workers after flying over the water while trying to sail to Chuuk Island airport.
The officials went to the hospital on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline says that 6 passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a bad mood.

Analyst depicts the night of a woman burned alive
The attacker accused the Court of the Man of Fire of a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explains to a number of the jury's assistants how he used the tapes to find out where the 29-year-old witness Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, died on the night before they died.
Rowlett said he found details about a number of places in which Tellis had Chambers on the evening of his death, contrary to what he had said earlier, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When details show that his cell phone was Chambers during the time he had your friend; hey Michael Sanford, the police are going to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Judgment and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the persecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford's cell that night, Sanford said "he was ashamed because his player was in Nashville."
One thing is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before he died.
The oral records show that they met once a week.
Rowlett says some time before the death of Chambers, Tellis cut off Chambers, telephones, and contact details.
"He came out of his life," said Hale.
The judge was ordered to start talking about the Church.
The jury expected the case to be brought to the judge’s aid congregation that day.
High Breed: What's Conscious hip hop?
This hip hop group wants to challenge the negative views of this type of music by filling its songs with encouraging words.
High Breed, from Bristol, says the hip hop is not what it was at first because it has political messages and talks about public issues.
It requires a return to the system and a conscious hip hop is done again.
Singers such as The Fugees and the Common have later seen an increase in the UK in musicians such as Acala and Lowkey.

You love a kid in NY who blames parents by deleting them with a message showing "extraordinary"
He loves a child in New York who blames a man and his wife for taking him away with harsh words after receiving a message from the mother of an unsuspecting child who says, "I'm another stupid person."
The parents deny that they are prejudiced, saying that it is condemned to be "in order to earn money."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who has two children, expresses his concern when he finds out that he will marry his little child, Giselle Maurice, a deaf person when he arrives on the first day of work in 2016.
"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent Nksz. Maurice, twice.
After seeing his manager, "unfree"plasco-Flaxman removed Nksz. Maurice, who called his children who wanted to travel, African-American, did bad work and was expecting a Philippinesman, according to the New York Post.
Nksz. Maurice was paid for work one day and was transferred home by Uber.
Now, Maurice blames her parents for misappropriating her, and she's looking for 350 dollars for six months, and with live-in gig she's noticed, without the counter.
"I wanted to show you that, look, did it," he said to the Post on Friday, adding "I know you're a traitor."
When the parents heard of their hatred, they said that it was a good thing for Maurice to do what they did. They feared that they would not trust her after they had treated her badly.
"My wife sent him something that he didn't mean to say.
He did not.
We see people passing by," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
But will you leave your children to him, and even a man of whom you have not known?
Has your child recently found it?
Kahlani."
Comparing this to "the profit of getting money," he says his wife has spent two months leading the child and "in a very difficult situation."
"Will you attack such a person?
It's not good at all," the investment banker adds.
As the case continues, the court of open - mindedness is quick to condemn these parents in connection cases, not encouraging what they have done.
The Paddington printers feared that the students would not like this file they were talking about, revealing the newspaper
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was loved, said in a book, "It's hard to put yourself in the hands of the first person you read before it was printed.
It is a pleasure to know now what we know about Paddington's success."
He says his father, who worked in BBC as a photographer before he was moved to write a book about a small movie ball, which he would never regret if his job was not appreciated, added 60th anuniversity of his works of this "failure and pleasure" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which he described as "the justice of our most important family," he added his father was not ashamed of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not proud," he told them.
"But because Paddington was real to me, it was like if you had a child doing something: you're proud of them even if it wasn't you.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Even if it was his first and thought of him, he would have looked after Paddington."
My daughter dies and I have to call her
When his daughter is waiting to be rushed to the Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, when doctors work hard to save her life.
"Nad was always calling that it was too bad, that he didn't expect to save," said Nkkz Ednan-Laperouse.
"I've got a call from Nad saying you're gonna die in two minutes since now and I've had to blame her.
And I confessed.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, please.
I will be with you.
I will be with you.
The doctors gave her the medications that she received so that her heart would continue to swallow a little less and she was still in the body.
He died some time earlier, and this had stopped working.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all of this had happened.
I could not cry or cry because I was surrounded by people and families.
I really had to hold on."
Finally Nkkz Ednan-Laperouse, now listening to his dead daughter, flew off the plane with other passengers — apparently because of the sad situation he faced.
"No one knew," he said to them.
"I looked down, and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's time for me to escape when I hurt Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how I love him."
A woman picks up cards to prevent suicide in a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in death work together to prevent others from killing them.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys became this source of cards in the Welsh blog with encouraging words and phone numbers that people can use to get help.
The son of Nksz Davis was 13 years old when he began to suffer and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel how I feel every day," says Nksz Davis.
Nksz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook and when the car was everywhere.
"All the people knew about her smile.
And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
Still, he quit his job before he died, as he was "very depressed."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother became the first to find him after his suicide.
Nksz Davis said, "I'm still worried that something's about to happen."
Nksz Davis began making cards, "to let people know that there are people who can talk to them, even if they can be friends.
Don't hide your feelings - you must speak."
Nksz Humphreys, a friend of Nksz Davies for many years, was killed by Mark, his 15-year-old boss, just after his mother's death.
"Never say you feel down or depressed or say something," she relates.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed how different things were done.
He said that on Christmas Day he was under another way - when children opened their gifts he didn't look at them or do anything."
And he said unto them, His death is great, but his power is for his peace.
It brings great pain to us.
But we must all continue to do so."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was not confirmed as the FBI began its investigation
"I thought, if we could actually find something like the one they were looking for -- a quick, large-scale inquiry -- we could bring a close argument," said Mr. Flake on the conclusion, adding that he feared that the committee would "distribute within" as many supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do an investigation?
The result is time.
The midterm election will come in five weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the failed republicans, then will fail in their efforts to find a person who wants to be elected to the highest court in this case.
George W. Bush was still calling the senators, encouraging the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and there he met his wife, Ashley, who was a writer of Mr. Bush.
What happened when the FBI dropped its report?
There will be a Senate election, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get about 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president's nephew, to divide the balance and bring it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea 'decrease' under Kim
The number of refugees in North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un began ruling seven years ago, says a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, publishing the details of the south-eastern border, says last year there were 1,127 holes - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park says the border laws are confirmed between North Korea and China and the high costs required by staff who bring people down to high levels.
Pyongyang didn't notice anything in the community.
A large number of refugees from the North continue to enjoy the rights of people in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have fallen illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled from China, with a long border with North Korea and easier to fall there than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with protection between two Koreas.
China sees these mines as illegal arrivals, not refugees, and often returns them to their countries with power.
The relationship between the North and the South in the war in a certain sense has developed significantly over the past months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of these two countries met in Pyongyang mainly on the establishment of nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after a June summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on several ways of working to eliminate nuclear weapons in Korea.
But in conclusion, North Korean Foreign Government Ri Yong-ho has not taken action since then.
"Unless the US trusts, there will be no hope for our country's security and under those circumstances, we will never close our own weapons first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelois calls Brett Kavanaugh as "control of feelings," which is not appropriate to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the Small House Group, Nancy Pelosi, called the one who may have been elected by the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh as "control of feelings" said and his feelings did not allow him to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi says these words in his speech on the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought I saw that if a woman did this way, it would be said 'to be controlled by feelings'," said Pelois in his reply to Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee on Wednesday.
Kavanaugh has rejected the emotion that he has called Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a young age.
During his first words, Kavanaugh spoke voiced feelings, one of which he raised and shared during a conversation about his family and his high school years.
He also made clear the Democrats to the committee, calling them "the collection of human knowledge in an organized way to kill" organized by the accused that Hillary Clinton was split into the 2016 election.
Pelois believes that Kavanaugh's evidence shows that he will fail to work in the Supreme Court, as it shows that he is against the Democrats.
"I think you're making a mistake about the words and how they talk about Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelois refused when asked if he could try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was taken, and that the Democrats found many seats at the House of Representatives.
"What I'm going to say -- if you don't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, it means that it's not only appropriate in the Supreme Court, but also that the court is not as it is now," Pelois said.
Kavanaugh as a lawyer to D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelois has added that as Democrat is concerned that Kavanaugh may decide against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is thought to be the next judge.
When asked, Kavanaugh did not answer any questions about whether he could answer certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a person to be controlled by feelings, who takes the lead in court and is expected to say, 'it was good,' says Pelois.
And women need to use their strength.
Proper instruction, months, and years of warm harvest, and there is no other way to spread it without weeping.
"We cry when we're angry," Nksz. Steinem told me that 45 years later.
I don't think so. What do you say?"
He added, "I was very helped by the woman who was sitting next, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she got the advice that when she got angry and cried, she said to the person who said to her, "You might think I'm in trouble because I'm crying.
I'm upset."
Then he went on.
And I thought that it was good.
The tears come out as a way to ease anger because they are so desperate for people.
One of my memories of my first job, the full - time male office, when I found myself crying because of a plant I could not explain, I was struck with a knife in the side of a mine that I had never been able to carry on.
"Tell me you don't ever see her crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry and happy.
They will see that you are in bitterness of heart, and they will rejoice that they have found you."
Patricia Schroeder, who became a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the time of the election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested on board a ship called Monkey Business and was released from the election, Unksz. Schroeder, very angry, found himself unable to meet his wish to enter the election as president.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said to me 30 years later.
"There are already seven others in the competition, and the harvest is not waiting for another one.
One calls it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because he would end the campaign, he had no money to complain, so he promised he wouldn't come into the competition and have a million dollars.
It was a war I could not win.
He found that some of his supporters, who gave him $1,000 to men, could give him 250.
"Do they think I'm getting a divorce?" he asked himself.
In his speech he declared that he would not make an organized campaign, he was seized with feelings of appreciation for the people who supported him, the frustration of the stimuli that made it difficult for him to collect money and seek people to vote instead of seeking members, and the anger over the conduct of the women was kindled against him.
"You don't think I'm going anywhere," recalls Nksz. Schroeder and how the newsmen listened to him.
"Don't think Klenex will be a cop.
Do I keep in mind that they will put me in my stocks?
"Have you been?"
How the conflict between the US and China can be beneficial in Beijing
Salvos opening up a trade war between the U.S. and China closed ears, and since the war is far from over, the transition between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the future, says experts.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S., issued the first warning early this year by publishing goods sent to China, including electric panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest average of this week is the new currency of $200 billion (£150 billion), by completing the share of all goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has repeatedly repeated it in the same way, recently placed five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
China has asked to be equal to U.S. Camashi, and the second largest economy in the world has less opportunities to be near you.
Making Washington clean and clean means putting herself in jail for its demands, but openly suffocating to the U.S. can be very shameful to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Nevertheless, researchers say that if Beijing can act wisely, the pressure of the U.S. trade force can lead to China for a long time by slowing down both trades.
"The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing can create economic problems in both countries is more dangerous than what people have seen before," says Abigail Grace, an Asian-based researcher at the Center for New American Security, a mental institution.
Syria's 'preparing' refugees' return, says the Foreign Ministry
Syria says it is ready to return voluntarily to refugees and needs help to rebuild a country that has experienced a seven - year war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign government Walid al-Moulam says that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in this is going to be calm and safe because of the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government also continues to repair areas that have been exposed to terrorist attacks to restore normal lives.
All situations now allow for the willing return of refugees to a land where they had to flee because of the threat and economic laws of the past that threatened their daily lives and the way of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled this war since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Some 6 million people still live in this area need the help of living things.
Al-Moulam says the Syrian government can enjoy the help of rebuilding a war - torn country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any help with matters or help from countries that supported their rebellion.

The U.S. team is heavily involved every week to find the fairies without Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the high-level golf among all the competitions.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk has spoken after his group's bad game, "I'm proud of our players, they're useful.
There was a time in the morning when we had to put up with Europe.
We failed.
You're using Thomas.
He is a very good captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll fix, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
