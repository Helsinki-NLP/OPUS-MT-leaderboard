Photo: Lina Ognisanti sells ice during the summer year, and the winter is snow.
For more than 40 years, a woman who has been trading in the city centre will be granted an improvement – a private exchange.
Lina Ognisanti, selling ice cream and cheese at the "Dinky Donuts" kitchen on the Bedford Midland Road street, together with the family were invited to dinner.
Nearly 3,000 people have signed a petition online in order to receive or receive recognition.

"Lina Bedforfe takes a special place, and her kiss is part of the city centre," he said.
I'm glad she accepted my invitation, and I look forward to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lin for the work in our town."
Mr. Ognisanti thanked her for her words to the "little" residents of Bedford who thought about it and said, "This is a great honor and a beautiful distance."

On the street with Alsterio "Lambretta" club
The "Lambretta" motorcycles were unforgettable students of the 7th century fashion culture.
A group of Italian motorists tried to preserve the spirit of those times.
Seventy years after the first Alsterio Lambretta club was founded, about 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered this weekend in the Ferman district.
One of the first two members of the first club, Chris Wilson in 1966, acquired the first Lambretta for about 40 £.
“I was only a vehicle, but I knew that I could use it and otherwise.
It was this kind of sport.
I didn't get involved in fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old," he said.
“They were pretty and pretty confident that you could buy them at an available price, and you got to win something more than just jump from point A to point B.”
He took part in the launch of the Lambretta separate flight on the TT side of the Meno island.
The first Alsterio Lambretta club was established in the early 8th and reshaped 12 years ago.
"About 1971 motorists and other forms of transport were less dominant, and in addition, the club was in general vulnerable, so I thought, "All is dead," said Chris.
"Then for some time interest arose again, and it seems to grow more and more."
Philip Steele is an Alsterio "Lambretta" club, currently composed of 97 members, the secretary responsible for the members.
‘All the reasons are different.
Some members were influenced by the culture of fashion, since it started almost everything.
Others are athletic enthusiasts or rockers – you will find all people here.
There are also those who just enjoy the winter.
Many motors are to be modified, so there are no two equals.
It is possible not to change the engine and the frame to drive 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved it.
Some highly modified engines may be able to reach 100 miles per hour."
During the week, efforts were made to stop some motorists from running.
And although Northern Ireland's air is not always as beautiful as Lambretta's father in Italy, this time the sun was lit up by motorists traveling around Ferman.
Ruth Davidson asks for the "Brexito" question
Ruth Davidson asked his colleagues for "a period of silence", so that the Prime Minister could agree on "Brexito".
The head of the Scottish authorities claimed that within two years of the EU referendum, there was a period of time for debates.
She expressed her opinion after Boris Johnson’s statement on the premier plan, which he called “unreasonably and totally absurd. ”
She said that it was time to support the Prime Minister's position on Sunday Politics Scotland.
“ For the past two years, we have had time for debates, ” she said.
The former Foreign Secretary had been responsible for the history of one of the best cabinets in the country and a large part of the current plan, which was already recognized last November.
The Conservatives must now support the Prime Minister, allow it to conclude the transaction and assist in the implementation of plans in the country.
I think the long period will be very useful."
His comments followed the eighth criticism in the Brexito debate, which was not the first time the former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later confirmed that it believed in Brexit and that its cabinet plan could guarantee free trade with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also argued that, with the participation of other markets, he would promise to prevent the second Scottish referendum on independence, since in 2014, "the parties were promised that this event would be the only one in their future".
When asked about a possible re-conference on Brexito, she replied: “If we are talking about the history of Scotland, I have never said that it cannot be repeated if you are a nationalist and you are not satisfied with the outcome.
I would rather have said that another referendum on "Brexito" could be held because I expected another outcome."
Several M8 reopened after the police incident
The M8 was reopened after the police incident in Glazgu.
According to the police, a few minutes earlier than 07 a.m., two steps were closed in the 15 Townhead border for the lack of anxiety about the train.

Christine'a Blasey Ford has approved a statement on sexual harassment alleged by Brittas Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who had been in high school with Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, was sexually abused by the candidate to Supreme Court, when they were both adults, wrote a letter to the Senate's Committee of Justice and explained that although he himself did not remember the holiday home where possible, he believed in Ford's statement.
Earlier, Keyser published a statement in his lawyer that he did not remember that evening and did not even know if he had agreed to Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, witnessing to the Court Committee, Kavanaugh often referred to Keiser's statement as proof of his innocence, but did not complain about Keyser's claim to believe in the words of Ford.
On Friday, President Trumpas directed the FTB to conduct a survey within a week when Senator Jeff Flake and other senators of the Republic asked for time for the study and for a week to postpone the entire Senate vote on Kavanaugh.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to his lawyer's committee saying that he wanted to "how to contribute to an additional FTB study" on Kavanaugh.
"But as my client has already explained, she does not know the judge of Kavanaugh and does not remember the evening or assembly in which she was with or without Dr. Ford," says Keyser in a letter written by counsel Howard Walsh.
The letter further explains that Keyser “did not deny Dr. Ford’s statement and already told the press that he believed in Dr. Ford’s testimony.”
"But the simple and irreplaceable truth is that it cannot be confirmed because it does not recall the event," continues the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, who was apparently behind the funeral, also said he was involved in the FTB investigation.
The people of Chicago are wrong to decide whether to stay with a corrupt police officer and get it
The chief prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change the history of Chicago police after a dark period.
It is believed that an unfair police officer had exploited the innocent population of the social environment and had unjustly taken many people.
To date, 42 persons have been unjustly convicted.
Ida B. Wells's project's social housing project is currently only left empty space, and more than a decade ago, its inhabitants have not used anything to corrupt Chicago police.
They were led by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The residents charged him and his tactical possession of property, police reports and arrests and arrests.
Willie's Martinas and Cleonas Glovis are two of the founders who have so far been justified by Kim Foxx's general prosecutor.
“ If you didn’t work together with him, you would end up bad.
You were against him.
You're not going to do it and win it," said Cleonas Glovis about Watts.
“I was very scared.
I wanted to run away from that area,
But I didn't have to go," said Willie Martin.
The justices of the Foxx ethics section will review further 30-40 cases related to Wattsu.
Ida B. Wells, the social worker Landonas Allens said that many people decided not to talk about Watts.
"Many things have failed," he said.
"But that wasn't important."
According to another former resident of Clarissos Baker, no one believed in the words of the residents of the official service of the hospital.
“He has his own gift.
Who's gonna believe us?"
Baker said.
Joshua Tepferis, a professor of justice at the University of Chicago, said that they had not really believed.
"The whole thing happened because these people didn't seem important to them and didn't care, because they're the black people who live in the social environment, so they're supposed to be doing something so much wrong," said Tepferis.
"Sergent Watts was sentenced to 22 months in prison for trying to persuade FTB informers.
Marteza's Wisse is also based in the Watts prison.
I just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He almost didn't know me, because he was just born, so I had to get in touch with him again," said Wisee.
"I spent four years without any need."
72-year-old "Fidelity" is the result of blockages, virtual reality and working intelligence
The potential of the "Fidelity" blocks was still seen by 2018 when all the companies began to talk about this technology.
The Director-General, Abby Johnson, led investments to the most risky and unsustainable class of assets in recent years.
"For almost two years, I and other elders had just been a bit of a joke, especially on the bitkin market," Johnson said.
We started to talk and realized that we had to explain.
The difficulty led to the start of a bit of a bit in the New Hampshire section when this encrypted price was about $180.
Last year, the price was almost $20,000, and Johnson said, “we noticed that we started working at a price that we never had. ”
It did not indicate how many bitcoins or how much Fidelity worked.
"Fidelity" staff have a clear view of these technologies.
For workers, there are now about 2,600 members of the "Bitas and Blocks" group, organizing seminars and meetings with specialists.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity customers the opportunity to verify the remainder of the cryptowaves using the Fidelity mobile software.
In 2015 the possibility of granting funds to Bitcoins was created.
According to Johnson, the company has rejected most of the other possible methods of use or at least recently rejected them.
We're trying to monitor the market.
And as long as Katie Chase, the chief technology centre strategy for "Fidelity" and the leader of the block circuit incubator (which is part of the FCAT), is looking for ways to use public and business blocks.
Chase was unable to comment on specific projects, but it revealed that he had a great interest in clients, partners and employees.
‘Everything is still very new.
If you get to the information, understand that you are still trying to find evidence of the concept," said Chase.
We have tried to adapt the blocks to different situations and we have learned a lot, but technology is still not such a step in order to solve these problems."
As far as they are concerned, the group pays more attention to trying to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They try to understand how to calculate physical objects, such as art works, the value of labels, or use block corners in the supply chain.
"Before anyone is in the center of attention, but I think it will finally get interesting," said Chase.
"Fidelity" will be ready for it."
As an example, she pointed out the journal Pebble, which was completely unsuccessful in trade standards, but eventually she discovered Fidelity.
Their group has created a programme for a planned period of three years to be completed by gathering millions of funding projects for the Kickstarter complex.
The Apple Watch, Fidelity, appeared on the market, was ready.
She quickly applied the Pebble software to the new Apple product.
"We were not sure that Pebble would blow the clock off, but we wanted to be ready if people would try out the best time," she said.
"We were aware and were prepared when the clocks were released to the minimum market."
Swimming and cooking on the island
On Friday, September 29, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi suffered a severe 7.5 earthquake, resulting in hunger and loss of nearly 400 people.

California schoolboys with racist inscriptions
As reported by the CNN branch of the KGTV, the Escondido Schools Association confirmed this week that about 10 students had taken the wrong decision to demonstrate racism to senior classes.
"We are proud that everyone in our school is accepted and that there is no fear of diversity," said Director Adriana Lepe-Ramirez.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and separation."
The report also indicates that the incident is under investigation by Escondido's secondary school, Union officials and local police.

On the basis of a report by the police invasiveness, students from the north of the school in San Diego were taken across the main classes by the pickup truck with the characters from which a racist inscription was produced and photographed.
The school usually has an early confirmation of the records, but the photograph is officially taken by some students who choose their own words.
The Union report states that such behavior is “not related to the culture, values or history of the Escondido Secondary School".
"We need to understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," said Lepe-Ramirez.
"Eskondido's secondary school and further family values and a culture-based culture throughout the community."
The former teacher Cade's Pannells told the KGTV channel that the disturbing picture found in the social media has caught him.
"It hurt me personally," he said.
“This made them seem funny, but it isn’t.
Only indiscriminately can be drawn from such things."

28-year-old Track Palina has been arrested for three delays, including closure.
On Sunday, he was arrested for not the first time because of family violence.
According to the records of the court, the incident occurred in Palin's homes in Vasilo, Alaska, where Track Palina was injured by his father, Todd, who was hit by a traffic accident.

As explained in the Court's statement, Track Palina was arrested for his first grade arrest, for his fourth grade and for his fourth grade indemnity, and his father was injured in face and head.
On the basis of the documents, Palina found out that the police spoke to him "requires" and refused to use the weapons.

In court documents, Sarah Palin says that her son was "sustained" and "used some medicines".
It is also ensured that Track Palina's police were given a couple of bottles of beer before.
He was arrested at the beginning of 2016 and charged with family violence against a woman, preventing family violence and armed robbery.

"Now I'm better than ever to realize that the best Americans need a leader who will honor and value them."
Elizabeth Warren comments on the nomination of presidents for mid-cedence elections
"It is time for women to move to Washington and adjust to a mature government that has to lead women," said the democratic senator, speaking in mini, gathered at the Holjok Roads of the city of Massachusetts.
"I therefore promise this: after 6 November it is appropriate to consider whether it is appropriate to apply to the presidents."
Warren, who was trying to secure his position with the Republican representative in Geoffu Diehl, earlier said that the presidents were not candidates, because he wanted to pay attention to the work of the Senate.
"It is very important to focus attention on the mid-term elections and the conduct of this kind, including the one important thing in 2020," she said to the reporters, speaking in the language of the National Press Club.
"The most important battle is the mid-cedence elections, and they will be important not only in Massachusetts but throughout the country."
Warren has already been regarded as a potential candidate for the 2020 democratics that can deal with President Donald Trump.
However, it would be a serious first-ever struggle that might involve other known democracies – former Vice-President Joe Biden, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
A third mental death in less than one year has been associated with a mental health clinic
According to The Mail, three people have been killed for years in a rare psychiatric clinic.
The television comedy daughter Shaquelle Vidal (23 years) died on April 7, almost a month of voluntary leave in Western London, Marylebone, in the Nightingale hospital.
His son James Lyle (57 C.E.) was a manager of the Risk Insurance Fund, a millionaires and former supporters of the Conservative Party, who paid for its maintenance costs for five years.
The future prime minister died almost three months after the earthquake hit Daisy Boyd (28 C.E.), one of the creators of the River Cafe, Rose Gray.
D. Boyd died on 5 October following his resignation with the author of the authorisation company Dan Macmillan (43 C.E.), after being expelled from cocaine by the clinical visitor.
Two months before his release from the hospital, Alan MacDonaldas (61 C.E.) was released from the hospital four days before his release.
In May, the Committee on the Quality of Supervision criticised the Nightingale Clinic, as this was not enough to prevent the introduction of illegal substances.
BBC's Mock The Week comics Avos Vidal daughter Shaquelle was registered at the clinic on 11 March.
A week ago, at a previous meeting of the Westminster Court of Justice, the Royal Lawyer Katie Gollop said that on 29 March Shaquelle died from AWOL and came back after a week.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Avos Vidal, said: "My client wants to know what happened to Shaquelle, what she was dealing with and what she was doing."
Mrs. Lyle called it Shaquelle's "fuck."
John Gordillo (52 C.E.) said, "I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at the time."
At the Gordillo meeting, it was revealed that Shaquelle called him on April 4, and said he wanted to buy and borrow quinide and he passed 20 minutes from this phone call to the clinic "more than a dozen times" but no one noticed.
"I see that further events could have been avoided if someone had refused," he added.
On 5 April, the clinical doctor found that Shaquelle’s mental condition was very low."
Less than 48 hours later, she crashed into a mobile computer.
The representative of Nightingale applied to his family and friends and said: “Our clinical goal is to provide high quality care in safety, therapy in a favourable environment. ”

Led Zeppelin again appealed to the court on the alleged "Starway To Heaven" guitar rif
"Led Zeppelin" was again brought to court in 1971 for the guitar rifle used in Starway To Heaven, which the group claimed to have stolen.
It is claimed that part of the 1971 British group was deplored.
The appeal court rejected the 2016 decision that the group did not copy the other group’s name ‘Spirit’.
The search was submitted in 2015 by Michael Skidmore, a trusted guitarist.
It seems that the "Led Zeppelin" song "Stairway To Heaven" will be long - as it does.
The group again stood before the court on the basis of the charges against the federal government of 1971.
The U.S. Appeal Court rejected the 2016 decision that the group did not copy it from the "Spirit" band.
It is claimed that the judge made mistakes, for example, informing the perpetrators of copyright laws.
She was brought back to the court.
Michael Skidmore's first search was made in 2015 by Randy Wolfe's trusted guitarist Michael Skidmore.
The police officers of Michigan were finished when the policeman passed into their alleged murder
At his daughter's murder, the resident of Michigan was arrested after the police raids that ended him when he was transferred to the police car.
It is believed that, in 33 C.E., Adam Nolina's fourth day in Michigan, Vayominge killed his daughter – 27 C.E. It was Mae Randall.
He was brought to court on Friday in the hospital where he was found by the officer when he was transferred by the police car to the SUV, because Nolina called the police to try to escape at a fast pace in which there was intense driving.
No one is charged with five serious crimes, including murder to kill and escape from the police.
"The visit to the hospital is not normal, but this is not the first case," said the chief of police, James Maguffee.
‘It applies to the treatment it needs, but the justice process must also continue.
Judges often agree that this can be implemented."
Nolin's daughter's body is found on the fourth day of mobile home in the Creekside Estates region.
The mother of two children was shot in one cell, and the police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
The police then announced a public warning about Nolin and presented a short description of the "Dodge" chip in July 1996.
The guy noticed his cock and looked at US 131 as the police tried to stop him.
Nolina and a pip took her to the concrete wall, then left the car and started running fast.
As he ran away, he called at the constable police station.
One policeman sat in the SUV car and moved Nolin from the north.
The observer filmed the event.
Nolia was confined to a hospital difficult but stable condition and remained there until she was released and transferred to the county of Kent.
"This incident showed that West Michigan police are at risk of their health in order to protect the community," Magfee said.
"They've taken the man very quickly and in the appropriate measures, and we're going to raise him very much."
In addition, he is accused of fleeing from the police, of carrying a hidden weapon and of committing a serious crime involving the use of a dangerous weapon.
He has not yet been charged with his daughter's murder because the investigation continues.
"Of course, we will continue our investigation of the murder, which we will soon be able to submit to the county prosecutor of Kent," said Maguffee.
The judge healed a man of leprosy, and brought him to his house, and laid him on a bed.
The judge was not able to stand before two criminals who were trying to enter his house.
Although a leper tried to drive him away from the field, in 63 C.E., David did not retaliate.
The university overseer worked for a man who was a fighter, beat both criminals, and lost one of their teeth.
The prisoners fled, but after the massacres on St. Oldham, the blood was left behind, which was found and captured by Craig Fordas after four months.
In publishing a decision for Ford, who did not have the ring to try to capture the individual house of Ormskrkke, Lancashire, Queen Justice Clement Goldstone said: “You probably didn’t believe the reactions of Mr. Oldham’s – when you were arrested to see just eyes and nose, you met him at home, and he betrayed you.
Moreover, he has washed your fellow man who tried to climb into the second high and escaped from the camp.
On Friday when Ford was sentenced to three years and four months, the judge said: “I believe you have two lessons.
First, you don't have to find David Oldham, second, you better don't talk to the police.
Because of your crimes, you now have one teeth less than before and you're getting a dog.
It's still a little bit of a punishment."
He added: "I want to thank Mr. Oldham for how he has responded to your actions."
Prosecutor Dr. Jones said that the crime had already taken place in Fordas in 2016 for another arrest and had to be sentenced to three years, but had been released equally.
Mr. Oldhamas Liverpool received a petition from the royal court on 5 April when he heard a knock on the door.
“ Mr. Oldhama, who has been a victim of a man, suddenly left the house and protested to his fellow prisoner, ” said Jones.
Fearing for his safety, he struck him face - to - face with his fist and his teeth.
Then another intruder came out of the room against Mr. Oldhama, who gave him an instinct hand."
According to Mr. Jones, the colleague took a wooden plane and tried to drive Mr. Oldhamu, and Forda said: “I've lost my teeth.
The co-rapporteur said to Mr. Oldhamu, "If we get out of here, we'll go out," and he and Ford escaped from the crime scene.
On August 2nd, the police paid Ford on a regular basis in the Wavertree region.
Forda pushed the police to the dog, and then he was dragged into the trap.
It is believed that the second prisoner is still free.
Forda recognized the burden of rape, harassment and dangerous driving, although it was prohibited and does not have a driver's certificate.
Johnson’s active companions were convinced by the apladications of the pope’s criticism
Torios’s activists today have descended from Boris Johnson when he was adopted as a “meek and aggressive man. ”
P Johnson, trying to influence ordinary people in his uncompromising speech about Brexit, received an ex-Minister for Trade Digby's Jones' serious assessment, which was also endorsed by the participants at the Birmingham Conference this afternoon.
David also targeted Mr. Johnson because he was concerned about the title of the magazines, not the policy.
In his speech to MailOnline, the Deputy Prime Minister May added that he was simply “slowly” because he could not be a complete leader.
The request was received when the former Foreign Affairs Secretary reopened the Prime Minister's Chequers' plan and concluded it "incomprehensible" and "very absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he strongly believed in the project, and here she did not agree with the resignation of the referendum two years ago.
He also urged the government to support ambitious projects, such as the bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May pointed out that it is critically playing political games and claimed that it is not possible and is ready for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro BBC on the board, which began the tour conference, he said, "I believe in "Brexit".
Former liberal Minister of Commerce, Lord Jones, now acting independently, received a minimum approval by hearing the "Brexito" perspective.
People were amazed when he made an opinion about Mr. Johnson, who was apparently responding to the concerns of businessmen.
In particular, without mentioning Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones allowed him to understand that he was a “slow and aggressive man. ”
"The world is very important, so by saying 'the best business', the former foreign secretary has shown that there is really a cruel and aggressive person'," he said.
"The whole thing is not with him."
Lorda Jones also improved his speech in the room following the response of Mr. May to the meeting of the leaders of Zalcburg, the EU's leaders will hear "record" to its cabinet plan.
Earlier, the Scottish mayor, Ruth Davidson, also criticized Mr Johnson by reminding him that he was a high-ranking government official during the negotiations on Brexito.
Mr. May, in the Cabinet of Ministers, MailOnline said that the intervention is not very serious and Mr. Johnson does not have enough support for Parliament's representatives to be able to eliminate the Prime Minister.
They said: “This news is no big threat.
He is disappointed, but he does not have enough support in Parliament's party, and he himself knows that.
We see the contrast between David, who respectfully expressed his opinion, and Boris, who betrayed his personal ambitions."
Business secretary Greg Clarkas criticized Mr Johnson, who had scepticized the business liners looking at Brexit.
At a district convention in Birminge, Dr. Clarkas said that Mr. Johnson was “all unjust”.
He said: “I am amazed that someone in general can think of it that way.
There is no successful economy in the world, which would not have been able to make a successful escape."
In an interview with Sky News, Mr Davies acknowledged that the coming months will not be easy, as the EU will try to force the United Kingdom to give a lot of relief.
However, he believes that the government must remain silent and reach a similar agreement in Canada rather than what the Cabinet of Ministers proposes.
When asked how Mr. Johnson continued to lead the courts, he did not allow the motion to be submitted to the former Foreign Secretary.
In commenting on Johnson's proposal to establish a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the political shortcomings of the British policy is that of a fantastic idea for politics."
He added: "Our co-operation is catholic and many of its ideas are worthy of title, but not strict politics."
Bulgaria spent EUR 80 million on the poor restaurant of European taxpayers
Bulgaria has spent $80 million on European taxpayers' money on the empty old-fashioned chicken restaurant, which now seems to be built from “sor and cardboard”.
The Balkan countries spent $80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
After returning the previous size, the restaurant became a place of rest.
The local government of the territory of the Republic of Kraków has promised to transfer unfavourable jobs.
The Bulgarian government has released ten million EU-free-free-trading pills to the restaurant.
The Balkan countries had released $80 million from the European Regional Development Fund to restore the old pillars and pillars, but after their previous size had been restored, they had gained benefits for construction work.
The remains of the well - abandoned reconstruction seem to be built from “sour and repeat” and therefore are not attractive to tourists.
For example, thinkers found that the strength of the medieval times of the city of Pernik of Bulgaria in the evenings of Kraków and the Roman Forts Trayan Vrata near Ihtman was rebuilt using polymer concrete, most commonly used for basic law.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and Bulgaria governments have privately agreed to learn from this failure.
"The fortress is a state of confusion," said architect and memorialist Stella Duleva about the Trayan Vrata.
She was 16 centuries old, and now she's broken."
Such reactions were observed after the Kraków fora restaurant in Perniki, so the local government promised a partial release in 2019.
Pernik’s claim for non-conformity modification was found to be ‘pubbles from the cartridge’.
The Byzantine Yailata fortress was built in the "syrian fortress" because it was restored from the mud-white blocks that did not lead to the atmosphere's atmosphere.
These failed efforts are in line with new doubts about how the European Union is using the development funds.
The Styling Medieval joins in this year's "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride"
Hundreds of fashionable motorcyclists from all over the United Kingdom have been allowed to travel on winter motorcycles to collect money from the Movember Fund.
The event is called the “Kilnaus Gentelmene Road” and is organised every year to collect money and increase public awareness of prostate cancer.
In London and 40 other parts of the United Kingdom, including Manchester, Kardif and Edinburgh, have been marketed this year.
This year's "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" is held in the United Kingdom and 650 other cities around the world, and it has been able to collect more than $5.5 million ($4.2 million).
The official meeting site says that in this year’s event, 120 000 people “have been dressed in kaclacars, dressed in kalararis, dressed in dress, sat on their classic and winter-style motorcycles and allowed to collect funds and raise awareness of men’s health, in particular, of prostate cancer and men’s mental health”.
The "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" event was held in Sydney, Australia, for the first time in Mark Hawkwas.
The idea was inspired by the picture of Don Draper in the series “Mad Men” where he sat on the classic motorcycle in his best row.
In London this year, a tour of the Tueer Valley was conducted by hundreds of memeria, including a popular taxi variety dog – Seržanta Piper.
Tennis' name Boris Beckeris revealed treatment from skin cancer
Boris Beckeris thanked doctors who successfully removed skin cancer.
In Becker's photos there is only a small patch of stone to the rocks from the sun.
"It was a simple test and seems more reasonable than it really is," he said to the German newspaper.
Once it was discovered that it had been treated from skin cancer, the tennis legend Boris Beckeris was photographed with a poster on his nose.
On the third day, he announced in German a Twitter report on his health: "I would like to thank Martina Mayr-Brune and Dr. Kati Maier from Munich who managed to survive me."
On Sunday, the 50-year-old pictures of a small patch on the rocks from the sun appear only.
“On the first day I visited a dermatologist who removed my original cell carcinoma,” Beckeris told the German author, “Image”.
"It was a simple test and seemed more reasonable than it really is."
Base cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer for 75% of cases.
As time passes, there is a great prospect of success.
Beckeris is currently dating Lilly Becker (42 C.E.), and they reported on the chapter in May.
The tennis star has gained six important prizes in the competitions, 13 Masters Series titles and an Olympic gold medal in two rings.
He has recently been seen selling to friends in the 185th "Octoberfest" Munich.
A 24-year-old girl was not killed due to an unknown train platform in her body.
In the training platform for the unknown body sizes, an unrecognizable British athlete decided not to take part in the discussion.
Jessica Mayho, who won a silver medal at the British athletic champion of this year, said she was buried on Friday afternoon at Lidso Station.
At the age of 24 and in five, 11 collages of Mayho said that she had been raped by a man who had just been beaten by a train.
About 17 a.m. on the platform, the bird’s wing has been removed from its "star".
However, the rising sport star, which was aimed at the location of the Great Britain team in the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020, was restored to the men.
Dr. Mayho, from the western part of Kittler City, said: “The last time other people in the complete platform were blind.
Such people may develop and force not to trust themselves, but they are MANO's body, Mano's "mechanism".
As he announced his move to the Twitter network, the young athlete gained much support in the social media.
The MBE commander Andys Lewis wrote: “Ostera!!!!
Is it clear?
That's funny, Jesse, you're all right.
I'm not going to let a fucking idiot hurt you."
Gavin Gray added: "I'm sorry.
Not only because of him but also because of the circumstances that ignored him.
I'm glad you're all right.
You're an example for young people.
You have shown that you need a great deal of self-containing, and the discontent can be undone!"
At the University of Ledso, Mrs. Mayho was an adult, encouraged by one of her older sister's coaches.
Since then, she has been able to complete the second part of Muller's British senior champion, which took place in the month of July this year in Birmingham.
It won the British championship medal just a month after the win of the North English Games.
The athletes refused to comment more on the event.
After a discount of less than 50 million users, Facebook will pay $1.25 billion fine
By using a security shield, criminals could reach at least 50 million Facebook targets.
However, there is only three days’ notice of a major infringement on the fifth day.
Now Facebook, under the new European data law, is a long-term crime
After a discount of less than 50 million chapters, Facebook may have to pay $1.25 billion fine.
Criminals were able to reach safety targets, so much personal information could be disclosed.
However, Facebook reported on the arrest only five days later, three days later, and until evening it was not possible to tell how much British records were damaged.
Before the search for the programmers continued, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who verified how the media has complied with the European data compliance requirements, as its central residence in Dublin, criticised the company by saying: "Transmission is not possible."
According to the new European Union data law, Facebook is a major threat, as companies may be required to pay up to four per cent of the world’s turnover.
Last year, Facebook earned £ 31.2 billion.
Criminals have reached their destination by using the Facebook function "See How", which gives users the opportunity to see how their profiles appear to others.
Dies journalist and author Vladas Dargis
V. Dargis was born on 2 August 1926.
At the end of the second world war, in 1944, avoiding Soviets, he withdrew from Kauna, where he had learned and lived, from West, from 1947 to England.
In 1992, he returned to Lithuania and lived in Vilnius.
1952-1957 V. Dargis was led by "Nida Press" London.
In 1954 he founded the Nidas Book Club and conducted it until 1957 and 1983-1991.
The paper "British Lithuanian" (hereinafter "European Lithuanian") was printed in the "Nida" club, and other publications from the Great Britain.
"Nida Book Clubs" released the latest Lithuanian writers living in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, the works.
From 1959 to 1961, Mr. Dargis worked in the U.S. Radio "Americos blassa" (Munchene) dictorium, registries, journalist.

The following entries in the MG Baltic case: the accused spoke to Gabriel Landsberg
The hearing began with a speech (meeting of November 2015) between former Vice-President Raimondo Kurlianski and former "worker" of Vytauto Gapši.
When you hear the record, it is difficult to understand exactly what people are talking about at this time.
It is true, in the opening that Mr. Kurlianskis and V. Gapšys speak of the Christmas celebration, several times the name of the current conservative leader Gabrielius Landsberg is difficult to understand.
Cultures to be submitted to and to natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, the charges are made to three legal and five natural persons: the Labour and Liberal Party, the Group of the MG Baltic, the former liberal and "working" leaders of E. Masiuli, the White House, the former liberal parliamentarian S. Gustani, the former member of Seimo Steponavic and the former Vice-President of the MG Baltic.
The Labour Party claims to be affected by fraud and trafficking, the Liberal Union is accused of fraud, trafficking and abuse, and the MG Baltic is accused of buying and selling them.
The authorities believe that the policy has been taken or taken by the vice-president of MG Baltic and later proposed or supported a positive initiative in the Seime and other institutions.
The former President of the Liberal Party, E. Masiusulis, is accused of the effects of trade, fraud and illegal exploitation, which was alleged to the vice-president of this party to be Mr Steponavic, former member of the Council of Vilnius, to be subjected to torture.
V. Gapšys is accused of the effects of fraud and trafficking, Mr Kurlianskis - on the effects of buying and selling.
Question: What is the greatest opportunity to win the second presidential election?
In the interview on the second election, four ranking candidates were included - economist Gitana Nausėda, president of the candidate Saulus Skvernel and two Fathers of the Union - candidates in the leading elections of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) Party - Seimo Member Ingrid Šimonytė and Diplomat Vygauda Uschack.
In fact, the following day it appeared that the TS-LKD was supported in the markets by I. Šimonytė, and V. Ušacka withdrew from the electoral struggle.
As data show, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases the second president's authority would win Mr. Nausėda, but the leader of the "Vilmurus", sociologist Vladas Gaidys said that it is too early to conclude.
"It's different (of others - DELFI) Nausėda, but it's very important to see whether the party is talking about or about people who are dynamic.
It was the doubts of the Shimonyt was from one study to another, and Nausea was stopped growing, and Uzachko was even reduced.
It's very important for you to grow up," says the sociologist.
In addition, in the light of the results of the hearing, it is clear that a small percentage of people are not yet determined by the vote or are generally considered not to be elected.
If the second presidential elections were to affect I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis, the war would be interrupted - 32.7 per cent for I. Šimonytė, for S. S. Skvernele 30.9 per cent.
The truth, even 36.4 per cent of the people replied that they did not vote for either one of these candidates or did not know who they were voting for or not attending the elections.
Sociologas V. Gaidys once again stressed that we have never seen a full picture before, because there is no publication yet available for all candidates to apply to a less successful Lithuanian electorate.
"If we look at the elections last year, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where's the candidate for social democracy? He's been a candidate for 30 years, isn't he yet?
When he gets there, he will see how his options relate to other candidates.
So that part of Lithuania, which is less successful than that is less reflected," said V. Gaidys.
In his speech to the University of Vilnius International Institute of Relations and Political Sciences (VU TSPMI), Politologist Majvydas Jasramskis said that before anyone else had made a very early conclusion, all three candidates, who had refused to leave the war retreat to V. Uschack, appear on the ground.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences do not mean anything.
The difference of 5 percentage points clearly does not indicate the advantage of one candidate.
The only thing I could see was that Nauseda would look good in front of Ushack (...) later, bearing in mind if those people were really going to vote.
The news before the Skvernel looks good, but we are now comparing apples and apples, because, for example, Nauseda has already announced that he will participate, Skvernel is not published.
In addition, the interview was made before the first conservators' elections, how would it look after them?" said the politician.
According to him, Mr. Nauseda has a small pulse, but when all the candidates are already published, he can shut up.
"The situation is quite the same.
Nausėda, Skvernel, Šimonytė - results vary.
I would like to recall that after the election of the President for the last half year before 2003, Rolands Paksas had a 5 per cent support to vote for him and then won the elections.
This cannot be predicted," said Mr. Jasramskis.
DELFI recalls that the candidates in the presidential elections have already been published by economists Mr Nausėda, Member of Seimo I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvyda Juozait, economist, Seimos member Austra Maldeikienė, member of the Liberal Union, Peter Auštrevicius, member of the Seimos Ngalis Puteikis and member of the European Parliament, Valentina Mazuronis.
Iran blames Israel for trying to get a cyberattack
"The regime in which cyber-weapons' history is clear from such cases as "Stuxnet" (computer virus) and has recently tried to damage Iran's communications infrastructure," wrote Minister of Information Mohammad Javadas Azari Jahromi through Twitter.
He was referring to an attack by the Stuxnet virus in 2010, which caused damage to Iranian nuclear objects.
It is believed that this harmful programme was created by Israel and the United States.
"For the sake of our technical commanders, they are left with empty hands.
We will continue to talk about this opposition in international forums," stressed Mr. J. A. Jahromi.
Deputy Minister Hamidas Fatthai said that the technical team had made many attempts to break into their systems on the first day of the election, but the defendants had been "given a firm opening".
Impuls's health club made a mistake, his recovery didn't work out
The accident occurred at 10.40 a.m.
In 1945, the baseine was badly injured by a man’s flurry, which he was in and out of the water.
He was quickly drawn out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
He was trying to get him.
Not long after the rescue, the doctor tried to get it back, but he was unable to save his life.
On his way to the hospital, he died in an emergency car.
This disaster was recommended by the head of the "Impuls" network of Health Clubs, Antanas Sakalauskas.
"In our data, 73-year-old men visited our health club on Monday morning with a woman.
The customer in the base was in his hair for about 30 minutes, then he went to the base road to rest, and after a few minutes he fell unexpectedly.
The country was a person - a client who cried in the back of the hall and a district overseer - immediately responded, drew him out of the water and began to receive.
The man was always on the move until the speeds arrived.
The staff of the club immediately received emergency medical assistance, which came within 5 minutes.
When he arrived, the doctor restored the man’s pulse and breathing and moved him into the medical car.
At the hospital, the doctors tried to stabilize the man’s health, but after 20 minutes we received information that he was not alive.
We experience the loss of a loved one in death because of his disability.
According to the previous data, the incident could have caused a client's health problem.
According to the information provided to the family medicine, he is suffering from diabetes.
We remember that in the face of serious health problems, it is always important to assess your options and consult with doctors and health-care professionals.
In all the health-care clubs, there is an up-to-date supervisor whose main task is to monitor the pool, access it and ensure the safety of the customers, and he will separate from other employees the relevant equipment.
Such zone overseers have radio stations where they can contact the administration and register immediately, respond to their requests or seek assistance.
Four times a year staff training is carried out on a security programme - much more often than that required by law.
At the same time, workers are spreading theoretical and practical knowledge, learning how to behave in the event of disaster, monitoring or keeping the rules of procedure and internal procedures properly respected.
How Portugal radically solved the heroin problem
In the 10th century, Portugal faced the heroin crisis.
Every porter knew something that would have happened to this dead drug.
Now, just a few decades ago, the country is growing in one of the world’s lowest drug - related deaths.
In Norway, the son did not arrive Gražina: he changed even four families and did not speak Lithuanian
As stated in the LNK press report, Lithuania did not have the right to bury the sons and see them with the Norwegian Children's Rights Service "Barnevernet" and the decision of the courts.
The woman’s story created an international scandal that followed all the media.
The national tickets for the return of Barnišu to Lithuania were prepared for his duties in Lithuania and Norway.
However, the public was not able to restore the sons of Lithuania’s citizenship to Gražina and her family.
Today, a woman says how she has been separated from her son for the last few years and how she and her child have been attending meetings after two years.
At the time Gražina had no right to bury the sons, the boys were 8 years old, and today it's already 12 years old.
In the first two years, Gražina never saw a son, it was forbidden.
Later, Gražina was given the right to have a son twice a year, just one hour.
Last, a few months ago, the number of hearings for the Lithuanian court increased to three times a year and extended to two hours during the hearing.
The encounters with the son remind each time of the alleged severe arrests - the officers are monitored, and the execution of them is a secret operation.
"The son has changed even four families and doesn't speak Lithuanian," - the heart of this Tuesday evening towards Gražina, her story - on the LNK board
Eligija will not be returned to Masiuli for personal money
On the second day, the Appeals Court announced that the defendant’s appeal had been rejected.
The contract is final and shall not be terminated.
In the case of political corruption, former leader of the Liberal League, E. Masiusulis called on the Appeals Court to ask him to return any personal money - from him and from his family money.
More than EUR 242 000 was taken from E. Massio.
The temporary limitation of ownership rights applies to these funds, which is constantly extended.
For the last time, the Vilnius Court of Appeal extended it on October 15th.
E. Masiulis The Appeals Court did not ask for all the money back - he seeks to recover from the amount of the income of 800 euros and its currency - 690 euros, 130 US dollars, US$ 1600.
The former policy said that the last money was allocated to the U.S. road planned.
At the meeting of the Court of Appeal, E. Masiuli's lawyer Mindaugas Bluvas requested that these money be returned on the first day, because the spouses' work was well paid, and they had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to dismiss the complaint.
"The judgment of the Court of Justice of the City of the District is legal and justified, no longer limited to the property mentioned in the charges made.
The Court rightly found that there are grounds for the confiscation of property, as well as the confiscation of extended property," said J. Laucius at the hearing.
On 15 October, the Vilnius Court decided not to return more than EUR 242 thousand to the alleged political corruption case for E. Masiuli.
These funds have been found through short-term corruption in previous policies at home and in car.
The three Judges' College found that from the substance of the case, property rights were restricted only to funds that constituted the subject of criminal offences against E. Masiuli.
"In view of the extent of the restriction, it is concluded that the right of the alleged property is not limited to disproportionately or too long" - writes Justice Nijölės Zímkienės, Juritas Kolyčienės and Vonnius Trumpulio.
The Court pointed out that E. Massius was charged with serious crimes, the criminal case was large and complex, so it was necessary to extend the term of limitation of the alleged property in order to ensure the possible confiscatation of property and the expansion of property.
Prosecutors claim that former vice-president Raimondas Kurlianskis gave 106 thousand euros to E. Masiuli for the decision of the Seime.
Both accused believe that E. Masiul found money - 90,000 euros - was R. Curlianski's loan.
According to the case data, E. Masiul is found at EUR 242.4 thousand, US$ 130 million, US$ 1.6 billion.
E. Massius and his lawyer did not try to recover money, but the courts rejected their requests.
The former policy has claimed that part of these funds belongs to others and has been intended to invest in real estate or to be the money of his family.
He also claimed that there is no evidence that money would be obtained in a criminal way.
In the past, the Appeals Court has announced that the allegations made by E. Masiuli that these funds could have been received by accepting more than 100 billion euros.
The Court argues that net cash could be obtained from undisclaimed sources, non-declaration, non-confirmation of documents and perhaps no legal income.
In the case of political corruption, charges are filed against three legal persons - the Labour Party, such as the Liberals, the MG Baltic.
In addition to E. Masiuli, the charges are filed against the former "worker" Vitatut Gapshi, the former liberal parliamentarian of Sarun Gustani, the Seim member of Gintar Steponavic and the former vice-president of the "MG Baltic" to R. Kurlianski.
R. Kurlianskis is accused of giving a kiss to former parliamentarians E. Masiuli, St. Gustavi and V. Gapschi.
The United States has threatened to destroy the Russians.
During the 25-minute transition, according to U.S. military forces, the Russian SU-27 was directly ahead of the aircraft.
The Russian aircraft crossed for him the second time, using the speeding of the train, and made a move with the gear.
Travellers have reported a feeling of turbulence during the first visit and the delay during the second visit.
The Russian military has the right to carry out international air operations, but this interaction has not been justified.
We look forward to international standards that guarantee security and prevent incidents that are relevant, including the 1972 Maritime and Maritime Prevention Agreement (INCSEA), - in its report the U.S. military forces said.
"Insecure actions increase the risk of miscalculation and possible encounters," noted the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized the incident, but it was hoped that the Russian SU-27 had left a "safe distance" from the US airport.
The costs of parents are not reduced further: the required activities are allocated up to €50 per month
The survey conducted at the end of August (32 per cent) revealed that a third (32 per cent) of their parents allocated less than 100 euros before the school this year, a fifth (21 per cent) was released from 101 to 150 euros, three out of ten (29 per cent) from 151 to 200 euros, and that less than one fifth (18 per cent) of their child's education was spent at the end of the summer.
The parents whose children started attending the first class in this year of the school gave their child a average of 220 euros, and the other parents whose children had already completed the first class gave their child a lower amount - an average of 160 euros.
It is not too much to reduce the costs for years of science, as parents often have to plan money for their children’s grandparents and corrections.
Depending on the nature of the occupation, the price of one star may vary from 20 to 100 euros in the country.
Parents who have school - age children were asked to tell them what average amount they are planning to devote to their one child’s demanding employment within the month.
The fourth (23 per cent) of the children interviewed planned to pay up to €20 per month, and the fourth (26 per cent) paid up to €50, three out of ten (31 per cent) for the child's demanding employment from €50 to €100 per month, and the sixth (17 per cent) of parents indicated that the plan was intended to allocate EUR 100 or more.
In fact, in Lithuania, children of school age are granted an informal education allowance of EUR 15 per month.
All these money can be used only for one star, and if the employment price is higher, the difference must be covered by parents.
In the event that a child is raised by several parents or children of a school age, the cost of childcare can be doubled.
According to the company "Vivus.lt" market leader Justina Ambrasien, small or medium-sized incomes for families benefiting children's grandparents, especially when children grow up in the family, can become a minor challenge.
For years, parents have created heads from which to obtain money, office goods, or new sports equipment.
Now the main concern is how to hire children after school without spending the money on that burden.
We note that the costs of parents are increasing particularly in August, when it is necessary to prepare properly for the new years, but later they remain higher than in summer, as parents are willing to invest in their families' employment.
Soon, if you lose your money and are responsible for your chances, they'll lose their money and earn it," says J.Ambrasia.

Caucasians rejoice in their fourth trilebuses already sealed
Today, four mobile street exhibitions of "Atia Old, Good News" have appeared in Kauna Street - a poem and a recording of "Sienograph records" marked by old trolebus.
The city of Kaunas reported on the new luxury trolleys.
"This old "Schkoda" has also changed its very red color to a much more colourful and smoother care.
It will also show "Atia elders, good news!" - to the city representatives of the photograph.
Mobil street art shows "Atia old, good news" for re-examination with the old trolleys that will be replaced by new ones.
For the next year, old "Schkoda" trolleys have been on their way to a closed rest, they have been replaced by 85 new ones and modern "Solaris" trolleys.
The Portal recalls that the first trip to the Kauna road was a month before the first trip.
On the trolley, we know a few well-known art accents in the Kauna street - old puppies and drums.
Not a week after the first tour of Kaunas, Timothy’s second journey was revealed, and the works of the author of the second road were made by Timothy Norville - Morfa.
On the trolley, the left-wing yellow car is represented, which is often referred to as "free".
"You wanted to replace the trolleys.
This sport seems very smooth, especially because it is also in line with the trolleys.
When you're on the track, it looks like it's part of the car.
When we put our wheels in the white, we made them like retro-styles, which made it very difficult for all of us to get together.
As long as the trolleys had not been burned, it certainly didn’t look so funny," - as before the portal of the Kauna.diea.lt spoke the street artist.
On 27 October, the ban was lifted on the third trolley.
It's covered with white, yellow, orange, red, but mostly blue.
This color is dominant.
One of K.Donalic's houses, on the right, is the central post.
"Vabal" has been my favorite," Morfia started the third trolley in the audience of the poet Morfa.
New Track
"Kauna Day" recalls that last week Kauna public transport company "Kauna buses" with Polish company "Solaris Bus & Coach S.A" signed a contract of 29.4 million contracts indicating that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolleys.
"The Kaunas invests the largest amount in its history for the renewal of public transport.
This agreement allows all of us to change the trolleys of the old "Schkoda" brand for many years and offer the most comfortable services to passengers.
The new most modern trolleys will have more seats, efficient living room conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's place of work.
The new technology and equivalent operation of a network update and road repair allow the trolleys to drive more reliable, much faster.
And, of course, modern design trolleys are very popular in the city," said Mindaguas Grigelis, director general of the company "Kaun's buses".
The first new trolleys will reach Kaunas by August of the next year, and all the old trolleys will be replaced by December.
Casual Sensation: Queen Elzbieta II celebrating together invited Ms. Markle's wife
Hercogenes Meghan replaced the British royal rooms.
This proves the special gesture of Queen Elzbiet II: the British monarchy Kaládoms invited Sassex's Hercogiene mother Doria Ragland, a British newspaper.
Such honor is not a gift from even hercogenes Kate's parents.
Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, and other members of her family have been invited to the traditional Christmas holiday with the royal family.
An unnamed source of "Sunday Express" revealed that the invitation to Doryai Raglabd is "the flag of the Queen's honor of Meghan".
Doria was the king's wife during her royal wedding May.
At the same time, the invitation to celebrate Kaledas, moreover, made it clear that Mr. Ragland is planning a longer public service in Great Britain.
It is hoped that she wants to help her daughters before and after birth.
Meghan and her husband should be born in the spring of 2019 to Prince Harry.
In the "Galgiri" arena and again the smiles show "Mother's world"
The formation of the Rudenenian routine and the more fishy ears, already 16 times the show of "Mother's world" has to be uninterrupted - women announce a long week, because even four days of hot, style and beautiful news are already here - November 8-11, in the Kauno "Zalgiri".
Running for years, seeing how the way the events change, is no longer a series of purchases, but a tradition of giving time to themselves.
It is not uncommon for this to happen at a meeting place and the reason for spending the day with her or her mother.
The four days of the exhibition have a special power - each woman here can learn the secrets of the toothpaste, learn the tricks that seem to light up every day, find unchanged products, hear or try various procedures that stop the skin aging process.
All of this and more, even 415 showcases, which will be the area of visitors in all three arena heights.
Three days will be held for a seminar on beauty and health issues, and the next day the representatives of partial sex will be able to hear advice in a unique way from the Stylistic and Networking Council of Victoria.
Most of the women in the business are faced with limited situations, as stress hinders stable emotional and physical conditions.
For this reason, Kauna’s trade, industrial and amateur rooms and the business women’s network, the idea was to organize a conference "Versle and Happy. Without stress", where discussions and practical examples will encourage you to help yourself in tense situations and encourage you to look more creatively at your life.
Like every year, I'm showing a meal of events for great masters.
The exhibition's long-term partners, the Association of Chirpians and Beautiful Specialists, will provide a two-day training for hairdressing and modeling subtiliabilities from the International Academy "Vinocurov & Friends" of the charismatic Dueto - S. Maslov and R. Savalausko.
The aim is to increase the scope of the competition for the creation of the imagination and the fight against the Art Battle, which will remain undisputed.
Between the top and the top of the tower will become a sacred festival of world representatives "Su birthday, Lithuania", in which a hundred prognosis will be possible to develop an unprecedented show - from body viewing to shock.
Not to be forgotten is another tradition of "Mothers world" - the most innovative presentation of the newest collections on Friday's "Made and beauty show", where the market will be the strongest.
And the taskmasters will be expected to be in Dekostuja's creative works, where they will be able to contact the interior of the original working houses or be more interested in decoding donations.
The last day of the show is especially expected for all the lengths, as traditional visitors have traditionally enjoyed the competition "LONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018", where new long-term cash records are available every year.
Premier: after the introduction of ethical payments, teachers' salary increased by 117 euros
Since September, the average wage of the unemployed in the country of employment has increased by 117 euros, according to Prime Minister Saulius Skvernel.
"It is early to say how much it (new procedure - BNS) has benefits or shortcomings.
The fact is that those people who have a full load of work - their remuneration increases by more than 117 euros on average," said S. Skvernels to journalists in the government on the first day.
It called the "democratic law" but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the process of education.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are allowed, possible.
If it is considered necessary to strike, it is their right to decide.
Only then would it not be expected that there would be children, scientists, in this area.
If the strike is to be done, it must be carried out in accordance with existing laws," said Mr. Skvernel.
The Seimas approved a model of ethical teachers' work, introducing the steps since September.
The teacher's salary has been changed by the weekly payment - the teacher's status is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working time shall be divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. training, preparation for them and work for the community.
This reform, led by Andrew Navicko, is called absurd, claiming to be adopted by the "buldozer" principle and announced on 12 November when the unterminated strike began.
The PSC requires immediate rejection of this "minute" pay system and the introduction of a standard model with a single stage of not more than 18 contact hours.
It is also responsible for increasing 20 per cent of the permanent part of the debt and reducing the number of children in classes.
In addition to other innovations, there is a critical introduction of a new method of allocation of learning funds, because, on the one hand, there is insufficient funding for home education, classes to participate in groups, qualifications, education aid, and in major cities as well as in the rest of the class.
The Ministry of Education and Science claimed that ethical wage payments of teachers allow them to regulate the burdens of pedagogical work and to pay for all jobs for the school community.
It is expected that the teacher's level of work for the community will be able to complete up to half of the hours per year, the first two working years - up to 40% of all hours.
It shall be established that the teacher's working time is 36 hours per week, of which not more than 24 contacts per week are required to teach the matter (the facts).
On May, the two-hour strike launched by the LSDPS contributed about half of the 100 general education schools, farms and informal education institutions, some 1 000 pedigree.
There are about 53 thousand pedagogues throughout Lithuania.
Need to be prepared: crisis can be expected for 2-3 years
Economic growth slows and even crises can be expected over the next 2-3 years, but both the Lithuanian bank and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, in an interview with the Green Radio, the "Verlo position" of the Lithuanian bank's president, Vitas Vasiliauskas.
"To believe that the crisis is already outside the camp, I certainly couldn't, but there are indeed signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy grows by more than 3 per cent, and the next year it plans to increase by 2.8 per cent.
The basic knowledge I would like to say to the public and the business, let's be ready for anything," said V. Vasiliauskas.
In his view, there are no equal crises, so they need to be prepared differently.
The distinction between the ten-year crisis is that the government at that time felt that the income generated by the growing economy would be eternal and that the costs would be planned accordingly.
As a result, in 2008, the crisis had been severely reduced.
Now, according to V. Vasiliauska, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"Yes, we see that the assessment of the situation of the Lithuanian bank and the Ministry of Finance differ.
We believe that we are already overhauling potential and that we need to press the stop.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance is not like that," said the President of the Board of Directors of the Lithuanian Bank.
The future crisis of the country's institutions is estimated by 7 out of 10 votes.
According to him, a small and open economy, such as Lithuania, operates very carefully on external factors.
The present major tragedies - the US, China, the European Union - will no doubt strike between us.
That is why we need to be very careful.
In the presence of small economies, we can decide everything, but I can't do it," said Mr Vasiliauskas.
What is the future for those who have made great sacrifices?
V. Vasiliausko said that the European Central Bank had clearly set up a short-term strategy, and decisions on change of interest could be expected not earlier than the summer of the next year: "The key objective at this time is to try to manage expectations."
The trend, which leads to the greatest concern to the leader of the Lithuanian bank, is the reduction of labour hands in our country.
"The reduction in working hands is not limited to the decision and the reduction in economic competitiveness.
Moreover, this is also a reduction in data managers.
Migration has allowed this process to be somewhat balanced this year, but you don't know if it has been a long-term trend," my V. Vasiliauskas.
Elta recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy is up to 3.4% this year, another 2.8%.
The Swedish Conservative Leader will try to form the government again
Sweden, which has been in a political shelter for two months after the elections, will receive a second chance to form a government on the first day of the election, announced by the President of Parliament.
Ulfo Kristerson (Ulfo Kristerson) The Conservative Party belongs to Aljansususus, who received a little less votes than the former coalition of the ruling centre's military.
The two blocks were difficult to overcome most of the remaining resistance to the anti-imigrant party of the Swedish Democrats, whose achievements were in the movement of non-unionism.
The first U.S. Kristerson’s attempt to form the government on October 14 was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stefana Lioven, announced his failure to carry out his trial and concluded his term of office.
In an attempt to force the parties to agree, Parliament President Andreas Norlenas said that the next week he would offer Mr Kristersson to Parliament as a candidate for prime ministers, thus encouraging the first vote from the time the government's efforts began.
"It's not clear from the past whether the various parties will accept Ulf Kristerson as prime minister," said journalist A. Norlenas.
However, he stressed that "the process must move forward and the dynamic between the parties must change".
"The real deal must be over," he added.
The date of Parliament's vote is still unclear, but A. Norlenas said that between the possible dates is 14 November.
In Sweden, the President of the Parliament may invite any candidate to form a government with whom Parliament would agree.
If all four trials are unsuccessful, the country must prepare new elections.
The current appointment of U. Kristerson is the third test of A. Norlen.
Some groups of Christian Democrats of the Dissident Party and Aljans' partners pressure U. Kristersson to accept the support of the party of the right party of Sweden, but he has not yet denied such an opportunity.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6 per cent of votes during the elections and which is the third largest party, ignores all of the main weights for a long time.
The Overseas Party, having successfully used the election of voters for immigration after nearly 400 thousand asylum seekers have arrived in the country since 2012, calls for the impact of decision-making on the change in aid.
However, members of the Alliance are liberal and centrally opposed to such ideas.
Since 2014, the S. Lofveno Social Democrats' Labour Party (SAP) has been in the process of creating opportunities for cooperation between the blockades, but only if it maintains the premier position.
The Alliance and the Party of Swedish Democrats rejected such an opportunity.
Delegation of the Afghan Government to take part in peace negotiations in Russia
Following this month's participation in the international negotiations on peace talks in Afghanistan, the delegation of the Government of Kabul notified the officials on Monday.
The Taliban will be alert to your presence.
On Saturday, Russia announced that on 9 November Moscow would hold such a conference, although the United States is currently trying to negotiate with Taliban bilateral negotiations on the cessation of the 17-year conflict.
The High Council of the Government of Afghanistan, responsible for the reconciliation with the combatants, sent four representatives to Moscow, the AFP said to the representative of Sayadas Ihsanas Taheri (Sajidas Ihsanas Taheris).
However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan has refused to answer whether it will withdraw its delegation from this conference, which will focus mainly on the initiative of peace negotiations between Kabolo and Taliban.
We are still in trouble with the Russian officials, said the representative of Sebaighullah Ahmadi (Sebagtula Ahmadis). - We welcome any peace efforts that run the Afghans.
The Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahidas (Zabiula Mudjjahidas) said that the movement was still in sight.
Moscow also invited representatives from the United States, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, formerly accused of supporting Afghanistan's Taliban, "mainly involved", AFP said the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Faisalas (Muhamadas Faisalas).
U.S. Ambassador Kabule has never responded to the request to comment.
The meeting was scheduled for September in Moscow from the beginning, but it was suspended by Kabul officials in order to lead the Afghans to the process.
The negotiations will take place in the opium.
The newly appointed US Peace Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzada (Zalmajius Challzada) is trying to convince Taliban to agree to the talks on the end of the war and it is regrettable that the majority of the meeting in Russia could impede these efforts.
One U.S. government supervisory authority stated last week that the Government of Kabul has weakened its Government in Afghanistan in recent months.
Kubos President Pchenjane met with the leader of North Korea
North Korea's leader Kim Jong Unas (Kim Čen Unas) and Cuban President Miguel Diazas-Canalis (Migelis Diasas-Canalis) agreed to develop and strengthen the strategic relations of their countries on the first day of the North Korea state press release.
Mr. Diazas-Canalis, who arrived in Asia on his first international trip after his return to the government in April, opened up on the following Sunday with his wife in Beijing.
At the airport, he was reached by Kim Jong Unas; the leaders introduced him to the city for the best of them.
North Korea's state media reported that the leaders held negotiations at Paekhwawon's home of guests, emphasised the overall socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much details, but it indicated that the atmosphere of the negotiations was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Unu could be assessed as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to ensure significant progress in the issue of North Korea's denuclearization are increasingly under way.
Pchenjana, who also sought the approval of Moscow during the past week, is strengthening the returnor before the meeting of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Maiko Pompjes) and Prime Minister Kim Yong Cholo (Kim Jong Cholo) in New York last week.
On Sunday, Pchenjana criticized the United States during its official press on inevitable sanctions - a political tool that Washington also used extensively against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea will be able to further develop a nuclear weapons programme if Washington does not change its course.
Sanctions are important to Mr Diazo-Canelio's agenda.
Last week, while visiting Moscow, Mr. Diazas-Canalis discussed nearly 50 million dollars (EUR 43.8 million) of arms contracts with Russia and received similar Vladimiro Putino's promise to develop political, economic and military ties.
The two Presidents then announced a joint statement that affected the US 'inland needs of sovereign states'.
The US economic embargo on Cuba, initially introduced in 1958 and later extended, remains valid.
Russians have been subjected to the United States and the European Union's sanctions on the accession of Crimea and on the support of the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diazas-Canalis has to leave Pchenjan on Tuesday.
He's still going to China, Vietnam and Laos.
In the safe areas - cars aren't safe?

At the time of the fire, the seventh high-level wall was constructed.
Record: the athletes in 157 days covered Britain
The Brittas had left the sea on Sunday in England, becoming the first man to die, and I was about to cross the coast of Great Britain.
The 33 - year - old Rossa Edgley (Rossa Edgelis) crossed 157 days into the water and reached 2,883 miles [2,883 km].
He rode in six hours and led him to the next support team on board.
In the last year of his career, the athlete was able to follow hundreds of colleagues.
He went to the newspaper in the village of Margeite in England, namely, this is where R. Edgley started his journey on 1 June.
The athlete, who was planning to sleep for 100 days, said to his fellow believers, "Get out of here, I'll be right back."
He said that after spending on the paper, the relief came first.
"I was very uncomfortable that my legs wouldn't hang," said the athletes.
In the world’s open waterways, the association indicated that R. Edgley, during this gravitational test, supported by the "Red Bull" manufacturer, had to meet with very unpleasant weather conditions, and even 37 times the attack was delayed.
The organizers declare that R. Edgley has twice improved the longest flight record with the rest of the sea, which has so far been 73 days.
He also obtained a new record, as soon as the distance between the southern and northern Great Britain points - Lands Endo and John O'Groutso.
This delay was achieved within 62 days.
Makabrika Klebonski forest secret: one that is likely already kept
This was a cruel transitional family, for the murderer was severely punished.
Only in such circumstances was this crime known, since the victim had no friends and was not reported for his distress.
According to the previous data, he was not over the age of ten.
Just like you're supposed to kill him.
One of them, one of them a week ago, the Kaunas District Court allowed him to be arrested for three months.
The second one, who is suspected of fleeing abroad, where he has been convicted of another crime, is still seeking.
Before it is written, the lawyers are not likely to comment more on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: for my children, I would agree much more
A new construction arm in the opera "Love and Death in Verona" is the most exciting of artists in the country.
Inga Valinskienė, who has been entrusted with one of the most important works of art, is a well-known woman of the Juillet village.
A significant part of the team also became Povil Meškhal, who will take care of the art dance.
"I mean, love stories from Shakespeare's times have been created very beautiful, but "Romeo and Jjuljeta", see, will always remain a symbol of these stories and will remain in different scenes for a long time.
It will be interesting to become one of these buildings," said I. Valinskienė about the fall of a new test.
Although a well-known woman is well-known in the stage, she has not yet had a role in various performances or musicals, she has no talent to play.
"It's time to play Juliet already, I'll shoot her.
- I should have accepted this offer in my own time."
The truth is, the character of a student in the drama V. Shakespeare is not less important, some critics are even considered the most important.
The veil is not only an intermediary, an assistant - its way and a tone of speech, a woman’s attitude toward feelings, and hence solidarity with the intertwined silk gives more and more other colors.
Moreover, it is also important that she is one of the only two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".
"The victim's character in my way and style is not very nice, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
Create a different character than has itself - a heavy part of the creative process.
Before anyone knows what the final outcome will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the director's interpretation, says I. Valinskienė and reveals that it will probably be the most popular in the place of Juliet's college as well.
- I think the victim heard his heart.
That's what most women do.
I'd probably do that."
The legendary "Love and Death in Verona" opera is created according to the famous V. Shakespeare drama "Romeo and Jjuljeta".
In fact, it is a tragic ending for two young people — Romeo and Juliet — to tell the story of love.
The end of the sad story is an obvious consequence of the conflict between young families - Montekia and Capulet.
"All the time the whole story is possible.
Parents who are opposed to their children’s choice will always be.
Only today's solutions to such problems - inter alia, - are asked whether the history of Rome and Juliet can be repeated today, says future victim I. Valinskienė.
- On behalf of my children, I would agree with much more, as well as with the marks."
Actor and director of Ramón Cicán's major opera - Rome and Juliet - will play the role of Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justina Jarutis, also in the scene will appear in Vidas Bareikis, Kęstutis Cicáns, Mindaugas Papinigis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulus Shinkūn and Aidas Barukukas.
The latest construction of the opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be delivered to the audience at the end of December.
The first new-colored legendary works will be released on 28 December to the viewers of Vilnius "Siemens" arena.
The day after December 29th, the hand opera will be shown in the "Fourth" arena of Klaipeda.
E. Jankuskas announced with which footballers will finish the national tournament
The Lithuanian football coach Edgar Jankuskas announced the composition of the national team on 17 and 20 November for the UEFA International Championships with Romania and Serbia.
23 footballers are invited to the polling station starting on 13 November.
13 of them live in foreign clubs, 10 play in Lithuanian League A.
Three representatives will be elected from Vilnius "Zalgiri" and "Trakū", two from Marijampolės "Súduvas" and "Kuno Žalgiri".
Most electoral leaders - Fiodora Chernyas, Arvydas Novikovas, Ernest Šetkus, Vickintas Slivka and others arrive at the national team.
The election will not be able to help the poor remnants of Lukas Spalvis and Karolis Laukjes and the safe Ovidius Verbickas, winner of the Vydrauškevićis.
After a three-year break back to the collection, the safety of Grata Sirgėdas has been restored for 23 years.
In the national election, G.Sirgėda was held only 18 years after the successful European U-19 Championship in 2013.
In Lithuania, the young European champion G.Sirgėda won 3 awards and became the most successful top player and was elected to the symbolic champion's team.
Later, however, the prospective football player’s career was stopped.
After a two-year break, another representative of Kaunas Žalgirio was invited to the election, Mark Beneta.
In October, the nation's tragedy level returned due to the defeat of the war with Romania and Montenegro, defeating the fighters Egidius Vaitkūn and Edwin Girdvinis.
"We will try to find the first points in the League of Nations, even though it is waiting for a very difficult two-way crossing.
At home, we lost the minimum difference between Serbians and Russians.
It's a failure and a success.
Let's hope the guests will be able to wake up.
Although this is determined by the passengers for the first place group and the possibility of continuing the fight on the road to the European Championship," said the Lithuanian electorate trainer E.Jankauskas.
Before the end of the Group of the People's Levels, two assets are left, C division 4 carries a very far-fetched fight.
After four items, the first 8 points are Serbia's collection.
You are a point from the leaders of Montenegro, two points - the third place to occupy Romania.
The Lithuanian electoral meeting with Romania will be held on 17 November at the Ilie Oana Stadium in Place.
Serbia's election will take place at the Belgrade "Partizan" Stadium on 20 November.

"Skamp" presents a sound that has already refused to show a single TV
In the 20th century, the team "Skamp" took the initiative this year and again to create music.
On 26 December, Vilnius "Siemens" announced a unique public concert "Skamp20", known as a tricycle of new works.
This time, it's "Love We Like There's No Tomorrow" and a beautiful music video clip.
"These creatures are about love, so I think that the climate should be filled with all kinds of relationships, regardless of age or sexual orientation," explains Eric Jennings, who is convinced that any homophobic expression is not normal in 2018.
The new "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" video clip filmed over ten different directions and age groups: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and we hope that one day we will not need to discuss this," said Victor Diawara, who created a creative music at the beginning of the year during family vacation in Israel.
True, because of this video, "Skamp" has already been able to overcome negative reactions - it does not want to show one of the most popular characters in the country.
That's a lot to say about our society.
Television will not show up because people live in it and it is not an inappropriate content for children.
And the fact that any TV can be kept on screen at any time in the morning is the proper content of the images of the mutants and other violences on the screen?" - retorts asked E. Jennings.
Erica's second and William Alessius: "You want to see more people with hands and arms, regardless of their social status, sex or age.
We raise children and want them to grow up in an environment where there is more tolerance and less habits.
The new music and video clips we want to explain to our listeners the day and give them a smile."
Since 1998, the Skamp Group has been listening to a series of lyrics that spoke in non-popular or opium themes.
The best of all the groups - old and new - songs will be played aloud and widely at the "Skamp20" concert already on 26 December in Vilnius "Siemens" arena.
It expects everyone with their families, and children up to 10 years of age are not paid.
In clinical transit - traffic accidents: hit by a two-way passenger
A few minutes after 9 hours the port of Kauna.diea.lt, the editor received information about the police and fast medical assistance teams running around Kauna clinics.
The reason for this confusion was explained by the interested party.
The Kauna police officer confirmed the accident at the clinic in Utena and Evieno’s sankarta.
They met a car and a driver.
According to the representative of Kauna’s rapid medical care, two drivers were injured during the accident.
Success, avoided major injuries, did not have an effect on the body.
A person who has lost his medical attention will not suffer in the place of injury.
The driver shall report that this route may be more difficult to justify due to the accident.
Presidency: LRT is not a political property
In order to bring the Commission's conclusions back into line with the SRT, the Presidency insists that the managers are merely seeking to gain more political control for the public translucency.
"The public broadcaster is a non-political property, and the fundamental principle is this independence from politics," President Mindaguas Lingė explained.
However, the Council has emphasised that the opposite process can be considered at present.
"It can be seen that these (political). - ELTA wants to have more.
This and we appreciate enough criticism," said Mr. Lingė.
According to him, the proposals made by the LRT commission operating in the Seima are quavitonous and questionable, as they apply to the independence of the translucent.
While Mr Lingė stressed the need to improve the management of the LRT, this should be done on the basis of expert assistance and in the pursuit of specific weaknesses in the activities of the LRT.
He stressed that the international authorities are already stressing that the activities of the LRT should be monitored not by the political and competent authorities.
On the second day, Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the Commission examining the activities of the LRT.
This conclusion has led to many criticisms.
The very sceptical evaluation of proposals to change the management of the LRT is to reduce the powers of the Council and to appoint its members with the nominations of the appointing authorities.
In this regard, the European Union expressed concern.
The opposition group of Seima members called on the Constitutional Court to investigate whether the Special Parliamentary Commission was not opposed to the Constitution.
Working abroad - good news from R. Karbauski
The Seimas began to consider the amendment of the Law on the Place of Life, submitted by Mr Ramón Carbauski, to the Lithuanian State and Green Union Group, which would exempt citizens from the payment of compulsory health insurance premiums.
On the second day following the submission of the draft, 56 members of the Seima were supported, and 25 parliamentarians were sitting before the 9th.
Following the consideration of the draft draft of the Seima plenary meeting, the Seimas also decided to request the Government's conclusions.
In accordance with the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area States or the Swiss Confederation shall be exempt from payment of compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania by the State Social Insurance Fund.
Living and working in non-Lithuania, in accordance with the procedures laid down by the Board of the National Social Insurance Fund (‘Sodra’) and the State Tax Inspection procedure, shall be deemed to have departed from Lithuania.
It speaks of services that are not used by man.
It looks for additional opportunities to fix that man has left," explained Mr Karbauski from the Seima tribe.
Such a proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the Conservatory of the Seima Matulo, would be unfair to citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
"The fact that Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of it," observed A. Matulas.
Social Democrat Algirdas Syss believes that this way we call on citizens not to comply with their obligations.
In his opinion, claims for the use of the health protection system would be made free of charge.
Following the adoption of the proposed legislative correction, for persons who have moved to another country they pay social insurance contributions, independent loans, the burden of the administration of Sodros’s debt.
At present, citizens of Lithuania who have actually left Lithuania, but in accordance with the procedure laid down by the legislation do not have a declaration of departure in the Register of Living Persons, shall be charged every month to the compulsory health insurance (PSD) and, if they are not paid, the debt is collected.
A. Done at Done at Brussels, but justified on classification
The Vilnia District Court left the decision to persuade the former former sportsman, Alvydi Duonėla, to be sentenced to documents being circulated.
The court's award was filed on the first day immediately.
A. Donegal shall be set free for a period of five and a half years, after the execution of the sentence.
On several occasions, the town council of Vilnius ruled on this year’s campaign for the campaign of the Lithuanian army and the campaign to conquer the city.
It was sentenced to a five-year term of deprivation of liberty.
The case was heard by the court of Vilnius, who examined the case under appeal, but the trial remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay almost EUR 760 for the Crimean Fund.
Prosecutor A. Duonėl claimed that in 2013, he shared a plant that had already been owned by his former Dalia Burokaitė, the head of the Odontology office, "Dalesia" he borrowed 200 thousand litres (about EUR 58).
It was only in 2016 that the couple learned about this when they received an invitation to cover their schooling.
An ex-wife told the man that he had never been pregnant and had never had a baby.
There are no objective data in the case of the judges of the Vilnius District Court to prove that, in the case of A. Doonál, there is no evidence that this is not the UAB "Dalesion" that is a 200 thousand litres.
In accordance with the arguments raised by the defendant and his defence, the case does not contain supporting objective data.
In this way, when it was found that A. Doonála had only used a separate document to cover and acknowledged that these signs - the use of a shared document - are a complex part of the fraud (in the case of doubt), A. Donólá was justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Penal Code, without showing that he was involved in criminal proceedings," says the Vilnius Court of Justice.
The fireman led the land-crazed cats - he heard the book for three days
According to a report by the Kaunas County Anti-Fraud Management Board, it has been reported that a three-day book of kinas is banned after the change in heat pipelines.
When I arrived, I also heard a cat's book.
It is clear that a few days ago, the heat track repair work was being carried out here.
Apparently, two chains could have been on the ground after the crossing.
In the summer, the heat trachea was turned back to the floor of a half - foot - long [5 m] hill, where it had lost its edge to the cats.
The son of Antonino Scalia claims that his father did not observe liberal protests about Kavanaugh
On the following Sunday, Judge Antonino Scalia told Fox News that his father would not be surprised by a protest against the so-called Justice Brett Kavanaugh, since Scalia believed that the Supreme Court was too late to meet the needs of the modern world.
"In general, it would not be a great shock to him for appointment to the Supreme Court, because many who are based on Roe's pre-Wade case – at least so positive," said Christopher Scalia, referring to the 1973 case, after which constitutional women's right to abortion was confirmed in certain trimesters.
In response to this decision, Mr Roe had recently tried to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that Roe was actually trying to solve cultural problems in front of Wade and in other cases, although they had to be resolved through the elections and the legislative process," he added during the show on Fox & Friends."
"In order to speed up the process, the Supreme Court has added further harm, and the nominations to the Supreme Court and the approval disputes have led to a more significant reaction, as the lawyers have a role to play for legislators."
In this month's meeting on the approval of Kavanaugh, the German Senator, Benas Sasse, expressed a similar opinion, reiterating that Congress has often given too much power to the executive authorities that are not really accountable and that the original bureaucratic issues remain to be resolved by the Supreme Court, so the judges have to do the work that the senators have done.
The capital police took over and accused hundreds of protesters of illegal entry into the candidate's approval process.
Asked whether Kavanaugh can avoid an adverse reaction due to unconfirmed sexual harassment that he has done decades ago, Scalia said that he will not be able to avoid harassment as soon as possible.
In response to statements that Kavanaugh should not go to the Supreme Court, because on the fourth day during the senator's hearing, he reacted angrily and sometimes – charges, Scalia wondered whether all the lawyers were well.
"The judges are not often upset," Scalia said, speaking about minor disagreements that sometimes arise in cases of opposition.
"Taisa, Judge Kavanaugh may have reacted more aggressively, but this was different circumstances.
He tried to hide his good name from unconfirmed accusations."
On Thursday, the Court of Justice of the Senate allowed the majority of the votes of the parties (11 to 10) to participate in the entire vote of the Senate.
Senator Jeff Flake of the Arizona Republics announced a dramatic moment to give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh only if the FTB will be given a week's time for research into the delay of the current alleged charges, to Kavanaugh.
The investigation continued, and President Trupas said that the agency was given extensive powers and that it could ask ‘just after the panic’.
“Schiapalli” ready-made clothing collection – fantastic works
Is it possible to induce surrealism?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris fashion houses, which were built almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, provided their first collection of ready clothes and handbags.
Fantastics, but not to attract the ready-made brand of a favorite product, this collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsos Schiaparalli bout of the brand.
The house of a long half - storyd house of the house of the house of the house of the woman was once and very modern.
In Esther’s decisions, you will find compassion, a sense of humor, a heart and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first combination in 1930 and was the first designer to model his music.
She and her friend Salvador Dali wanted to harmonize me and my mind, and now Calvinis Klein and Rafa Simons, co-operated with American poet Sterling Ruby, took this idea.
The legend is that Dali, along with Schiaparelli, was created with the motive of the omora, wanted to excommunicate a certain minor, but did not accept.
The hair was painted without a dome with Mano Ray'au's design "Electricité" on the desk.
Photo: "Schiaparelli"
"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation that was not different from the history of Schiaparalli," said Bertrand Guyon, the director of the construction, who spoke at the house of a house in the valley of Vandom last three years.
He supported Schiaparalli in his friendship with Manu Ray and, in cooperation with the Mano Ray'au Foundation, he created clothes according to well-known art works.
The image of the artist's eye-opened eyes is illustrated on the tracks of Perspex and the red holes from the "Observator's Time: Insults" on the right silge with the soles.
Mano Ray'aus "Sticky Ass" on the collection trails
One of Elso's changes was an attractive drawing for the S. His company color – "Squeaking pink" inspired her "Squeaking" bubbles.
The first Guyon's "Schiapalli" hand with a stick on the line called "Pashmatis".
Their minimum price will also be fantastic – 5000 £.
A temporary shop opened in a warehouse in the western corner of Senos, in which the surrealist part of the Paris fashion week was demonstrated and 100 € was available for purchase of Virgilo Abloho's products from the newly shown Ikea collection.
Over half an hour before the opening, more than 500 young Abloho's respectable men appeared on the line on the appeal line, without being able to buy one of his favorite works, rather than his "Louis Vuitton" men's clothes.
This project will help Ablohu to achieve a wider audience than is available for the mill or designers to build furniture.
“No one has any property, but the knowledge of certain things can help you start a conversation at the southern table.
That's what he's saying thousands of times," he recently said.
The audience in the Sea region understood that this event in the garage would not be unusual when the models began to run for them on the stairs.
A collection of men and women's coloured and painted by the designer of Westwood was supported by Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabolo.
Some women (and a few men) who had been in the theaters were on their way to the gymnasiums, but they were on their own.
Westwood, watching the show in the first row and enjoying the collection with his horse’s motives and orange, joined her to her husband with a beautiful smile on his face.
Strong two-bit links in photos
Detroit was born and Peter Zelewski, who lived in London, was already established as a street photographer when he started taking two photos four years ago.
"As a photographer and people, I always dreamed of two and an unusual relationship that everyone was talking about," he said.
The photographer did not intend to create the whole project, but he said, “after taking the first two portraits, I gained independence and there was no way back.”
The book "Two" will soon show 44 identical pictures and stories of two pairs.
This project is more visual, he says: "It's not a documentary or a scientific project – I wanted to photograph the effects and sensitive portraits of people."
Servants have claimed non-confidential trust in the professional union, taking into account the wage negotiations
The members of the Royal Service College, who failed to meet the professional union deal with the National Health Service on wages, after the vote asked the non-confidential union and accused it of requiring an increase in the amount expected.
This unprecedented decision was adopted after the closing of the Royal Service College, when its former Secretary-General, Janet Davies, admitted to the wrong assurances made by members that their payments would increase by 3% this year, once a 1% tax restriction has been lifted.
Upon the unexpected arrival of the expected salary, the members arrived and forced David to withdraw from the duties, presented the petition, and gathered on Friday a quick meeting with Birmingham, after which he appealed to the College Council for Distrustment.
"The sincere and open debate in Birmingham has helped to clarify relations, so the college will only be strengthened," said Mr. Maria Trewern, director of the Royal Service College.
"The Council of the Royal College of Service and the leadership understood the message sent to it.
In recent weeks, the Council has already tried to make changes in the organisation and has tried to listen to and include the members; we will continue our efforts to implement it."
The meeting will take place next week and is expected to be attended by members of the Royal College of Service.
"The basis for the service is trust," said the national health service provider "Guardian".
‘The activities of the Royal College of Service have raised confidence, and the Council must therefore refrain.
I hope that she will be respectful and listen to the request.
It is interesting whether the members of other trade unions will also be able to negotiate."
In the National Health Service, the State of the General Professional Union official Rachel Harrison said, "Guardian, I am grateful that the National Health Service staff of all countries understood the unexpected expectation.
It caught them."
Before the extraordinary meeting, the Royal Service College recognized that it had made mistakes in the 2018 remuneration negotiations and had informed them in advance.
However, it is also argued that the Royal College of Services campaign on the abolition of the tax restriction has forced the government to decline this restriction and to promise to gradually increase the wages of 6.5 per cent over three years.
The vote was taken after an independent study, which found that the college was willing to initiate negotiations and Davies was charged with insufficient weight assessment of the transaction.
It is claimed that the Royal Service College provided information that did not match the facts, so the members were unable to take a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The College has published conflicting information on whether all employees will receive 3% increase in wages.
In the report before the collapse of the college, representatives were wrongly alleged to have planned “3% of growth and growth in the progressive implementation of the reform”.
In fact, the wage had to be gradually increased to 3% and only a few of the largest wage earners would have been able to increase from once a year.
‘The information provided to the members after the merger was incorrect (mostly because it was tried to simplify it),’ said the representative of the Electoral Reform Service of the investigation.
"The ESS considers that the decision-making countries had not been able to explain clearly the differences between the existing systems and the proposed transaction and that the main advantages, including the number of 6.5 and 29% mentioned during the campaign, were not clearly understood and therefore it was not possible to take a reasoned decision."
78 per cent of the votes were voting in favour of the decision, while 3.74 per cent of the members of the Royal Service College attended the vote.
Lindsay Lohan joked "Instagram" to see direct transmission by trying to "make" children out of the family
Lindsay Lohan received criticism about the direct transmission of Instagram, through which she followed the Benjamin's family and tried to separate the sons from the parents.
Direct transfers, most quickly filmed in Moscow (based on Lohan’s earlier update on Instagram), initially proposed that the family be prepared for the night place, but the situation was rapidly complicated.
"Good for all! I want to show you what family I'm dealing with," she said to the observers, "that's the refugees from Syria, I'm very worried about them.
They really need help.
Would you like to come with me?
“ I’ll take care of you today, ” she said to the family before returning to one of the children, “Would you like to spend the night at the hotel?
Watch movies?
It would be hard to watch a movie on television or on the computer."
After his parents died, Lohan reacted in a way that was contrary to him.
“Your children shouldn’t be on the road, they should be hard to work and do everything they can to improve their lives.
“If someone offers them houses and a place of night, as I am now, they should agree.
They're coming back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't bother with me."
When the family tried to get away from Lohan on the road, the actor followed her straight through Instagram.
“Look what you are doing – it’s trade for children. This is how you develop the Arab culture.
They'll lead children, even if they don't want to go with you.
Bernie, don't worry, I'm with you and now we're seeing the whole world."
The transition ended the physical confrontation – it seems that his mother was a tyrant of Lohan.
The climate of the video entry appeared in the social media, and some users wondered whether this could not be comparable to the testing.
"The Independent" contacted Lohan for comments.
A third of the British believe that he will never pay for all the debts he has available
Almost a third of Britain believes that they will not be able to cover their debts during their lifetime, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
“Equifax” and “Gorkan” research, with results revealing only “The Independent”, showed that the British, in particular those 18 to 24 years of age, believe that all life will have debts, and only half of them will expect to be released from them.
In recent years, a report published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies indicates that students who have completed their studies remain at about 46,000 schools, while the most poor students remain under more than 57,000.
Most graduates (81 per cent) will never pay all the debts, so the first 30 years' work is under pressure.
Public loans increase: National Statistics Department data, the United Kingdom’s family debt is a record size, and the United Kingdom spends over $900 per year on average more than employment.
But is it worth noting this terrible statistics?
Is it just a new way of life for young adults (and for all the public) to live?
As an example, car rentals that are another stamp buyer will be purchased at home (if such success is achieved).
Auto Trader predicted this week that all new cars would be recharged in ten years – this would be the usual way to buy vehicles.
The Director of EQ Investors and certified financial planner Jeannie Boyle believe that expectations have changed.
"At these times, it is quite normal to have debts: the credit card has been destroyed, the percentage of refinancing, student loans and fast credit," she said.
"There have been times when our old people were tired of having debts."
In these times, the debt of students and future prices has become a normal phenomenon.
This claim is also supported by Moira O'Neill, head of the Interactive Investor's Personal Finance Division, who believes that the results can be of concern.
“If you have a high amount of schooling that exceeds your income four or five times, you can prove that the additional debts are unnecessary”, she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so large loans or other debts have to be considered if standards are changed."
It may not be necessary to monitor that the financial industry's commentators have no doubt.
The director of Freedom Finance of the loan agency Brian Brodie says: "The debt is not taboo.
The last departure shall not be paid for the repair of the house or for the new car.
Due to the low interest rates, many people have contributed to the savings in the longer-term deposits from which a larger return is made, but it is not so easy to get saved money.
As a result, the middle class is becoming more and more schooly.
Over the past six months, about half of the new loans have been received by customers with a great credit rating."
Richard Haymess, head of the TDX Group Financial Resolution Section of Equifax, believes that such expectations – the whole life of the school – are really a matter of concern.
He says: “Inflation was the largest in six months (2.7 percent), the rate of interest dropped, and employment increased slightly, so many people do not respect the decision to borrow without a realistic plan of return to school.
Our analysis showed that this year the number of banknotes will increase by 17 per cent, and the main factor is a record of consumer lending."
The debt may not be much of a concern to a person’s work and employment, but it is not clear how life without wages will reflect his goodness in his old age.
A study of the Economic and Business Research Centre, carried out in conjunction with the loaning of money for replaced property specialists from More 2 Life, showed that the unencumbered debt of 55-74 people has increased over the last four years by more than a third, i.e. more than twice as much as the country average.
This age group is mostly educated on credit cards and spends 30 percent more each month than work.
Boyle added: “In 55 C.E., more people choose to pay loans from pension funds, and this will affect their living in retirement.
Most often it is a single summary which they have "required" to save.
In addition, people believe that using wealth will lead to wealth later, but changing wealth to wealth will not bring much more wealth than expected.
If the price of the property falls, this situation will only be weakened."
Insinuated to half of Serena Williams composed "I Touch My Self" to focus attention on breast cancer
Serena Williams released a video recording in which she sang the classic "Divinyls" song with the "I Touch Myself" hand with a heavy chest.
The tennis eye shared the click on its "Instagram" page and explained that the video was created to encourage women to check their own breast.
"This month of fighting with breast cancer, I wrote the "The Divines" version of the World Cup "I Touch Myself" to remind women to check themselves regularly," William wrote.
“So I left my comfort zone, but I wanted to do this because this problem affects women of all races all over the world.
Most important of all, it helps to save many lives.
I hope I can remind women of this."
William continued: "This music clip is part of the I Touch My Own Project, which is being implemented by the famous Chrissy Amplett, who died from heart cancer and gave us his emergency to remind women of his health first."
The project is supported by the "Berry for Brest Cancer Network Australia" (BCNA) brand of Amplett after its death in 2014.
The video record, published by the tennis star in its Instagram section, has gained more than 1.5 million reviews and a large number of viewers for how the tennis player made the sound.
"You'd be laughing at this rock and your courage to do it.
"Thank you, Serena," said one respected man.
Another added: “Serena, it’s NOOSTABU.
Some 20 years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and I was diagnosed with a brain tumor myself, even when my mammograms did not show anything.
It's just necessary to verify.
Thank you for not being afraid to leave the comfort zone - you're really a virgin!"
"Berlei" also released a new Living Skin Editor "The Chrissy" to the project "I Touch My Own Project" which inspired the star.
100 per cent of the profit obtained after sale of the limenium will be paid to BCNA.
In self-check, it is important to know what signs and symptoms need to be searched.
The signs of breast cancer are not only small but also changed the size or shape of the breast, breasts or shoulders, except for spinal cord, skin surface swelling, permanent pain or changes in skin texture.
In addition, cancer can be prevented by the spread of cancer to a wound or tortilla, a broken vein, and a broken spinal cord.
Women are advised to check their breast every month.
Following any signs of breast cancer, NHS recommends immediate contact with your family doctor.
If your family doctor decides that your symptoms need to be evaluated further, he will take you to a breast cancer clinic.
Adam Drivers brought the entire SNL film group quatto
Adam's driver was this week's "Saturday Night Live" Christmas star, and he really tried to make it all go away.
The best news fairs are usually not related to a specific event – as a new exhibition called “Karjeros Day”.
The average U.S. school day is seen when students bring their parents up, and adults Mortdecais (Peter Davidson) do not want to agree that his father, an old oil magnetist Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver) would speak the language.
In Lazdele Parnassus, whose megalomanic personality was able to inspire Daniel Day-Lewis, actor Daniels Plainview from the film "Bes Blood" shows how he managed the oil industry.
“I was born seven months earlier,” says Parnassus to students.
"Incubators' technologies were just broken, so I was put into a room and heated in a cockroach before I learned to walk.
My bones haven't changed, but not my spirit!
Be strong and defend your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague SNL Actor Aidy Bryant, playing the teacher, just keeps his head down and can't see the driver in the eye.
However, the actor of the Star Wars is only running and he starts telling about his personal war with another oil magnet H. R. Pickins.
"I've got your ring!" he sighs.
"I have filled her womb with my favorite seeds, and I have defiled your bride: this is my final meal, H.R.!"
The trainer in less than five minutes became the same memorable character of Adam's driver as Kyle Renas from two films.
"Be careful, H.R.!"

The site can be called a representative home area, where we allow time with friends, welcome guests, and so it should be arranged in such a way that it is convenient not only for home and family members but also for guests.
Depending on the size of the site, the walls, the ceilings, the family seat, should be selected.
The site should be not only beautiful but also comfortable.
The best thing to do with the help of an interior designer, which will help optimally fill the area so that it will not be overloaded or turned around - too empty.
In particular, it is recommended to set the main website point, i.e. the item on which you link the sheets, other details.
This may be a wise or other important accent of the website's interior.
It would also be nice to create a chat room where guests can be very friendly so that they will not be disturbed by the whites and the blacks in the area.

Therefore, the appearance of birds should promote communication, unite people, and not distance them from each other.

The Prosecutor sentenced the LKF's executives to a fair trial
The Office of the District of Vilnius condemned the judicial decision of Vilnius to the former leaders of the Lithuanian Crescent Federation (LKF).
As the prosecutor reported on the first day, the complaint indicates that the municipality of Paneväži did not have legal basis to contribute to the reconstruction of the private hotel in Paneväžia by means of the municipal budget.
In the case of a preliminary investigation, it was found that, in order to find the possibility of financing the reconstruction of the hotel, a public procurement and sale contract was concluded in 2010 between the municipalities of the Lithuanian Crescent Federation and the city of Panevėžia.
The Prosecutor argues that the services provided by the federation under that contract were to be provided to the municipality of Paneväžia, to be nectin and could not be provided, because the provision of services had already been received or financed by state and sponsors, part of the envisaged arrangements had already occurred before the signature of the contract and had already been paid out of other funds, and parts of the arrangements had already occurred after the publication of the accounts of VAT - the money on account-based invoices had been transferred to non-performance events.
The Court of First Instance, in its judgment of the Court of First Instance, finds that the State itself has committed itself to the municipality of Paneväžia to undertake a private reconstruction of the municipality, since no State obligation for a specific municipality has been made, but the proposal to the municipality of Paneväže has been made to address the issues of the development of the municipality as quickly as possible.
In the Court’s view, the Court found that the leaders of the LKF and the municipality of Paneväže have tried to fulfil the State's obligations without having to do so because the data contained in the case showed that it was possible to organize the movement of a European crew in other cities without violating the laws.
The District Attorney of Vilnius requests the appeal to remove the Court's judgment in the first instance and to adopt a new - binding - decision on seven natural persons and one legal person.
On 15 October, in respect of all the crimes committed, the Court of Justice of the Vilnia District ruled in full justice for all the crimes committed by the LKF Secretary-General Mindauga Balchiun.
This is related to the preparation of a European Men's Corps Championship in Lithuania in 2011.
Mr. Balchiun was accused of abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The Prosecutor-General of the LKF claimed that, in his opinion, he agreed with the Federal Secretary-General and the Executive Director to record on behalf of the federation non-performing work - transfer documents and other financial documents and to include in the official accounts the services provided to the municipality of Panevėžia.
A judicial investigation carried out by the officials of the Panjeväži Government of the Special Research Service (STT) revealed that the funds of the municipality of Paneväži could be around and the benefits of the LKF managed and later used for the reconstruction of the "Romantic" company's "Via Unica" hotel.
The head of this hotel, Dalia Kukileenė, was accused of buying - it is believed that she gave the TV to Mr. Balchiun.
Everyone with Mr. Balchiun is trying to justify himself.
The cults were presented in this case to eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Krepsian Federation.
Original location of work - between Bermuda Trikams
In Lithuania, the number of people who have been injured or killed has already exceeded the total number of inhabitants of the city of Alyta has grown to some 83 thousand.
If the demands for physical jobs and their safety are met and clear, this will become a personal choice for a new Bermuda trip to work in a far-reaching way - from home, public areas or even other countries.
While safety and health experts argue that while the Law provides for remote work for workers from other business workers, the diversity of modern forms of work can lead to a number of issues written by the press.
In the event of an accident in the building, for the first two working days, 80 per cent of the compensation is paid by the employer, and for the rest of the period, "Sodra".
If it is found that an accident occurred at work - since the first day of unemployment, Sodra pays 100% of the wage.
The evaluation of the statistics submitted by the State Labour Inspection and the BTA is subject to damages in the light of the fact that the absolute majority of accidents and various injuries occur at the workplace.
In most cases, these are different physical works where the risk of injury is higher: unscathed with devices or equipment, losing concentration or coordination.
However, even the bureaus where most of the most demanding, best paid specialists are meeting their own challenges, which are given to workers and which are very well-sustained by workers' freedom of mobility," says BTA Human Resources Management Division leader Jevgenija Kristchiunė.
The legislation in force in Lithuania recommends clear regulation of the employee’s duties and responsibilities, defining the working time, place and functions, and this also applies in a far-reaching way.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred during work or not.
There are certainly different situations and challenges, each case being individualized.
Workers are often also aware of the fact that the employer is responsible when we look at or from work or when we travel to or from work because of an unfortunate event.
However, in this case, there are very few obstacles and opportunities, so I would encourage both employees and employers to start conversations, to clarify and to make the most clear and acceptable list of the situations that are really considered to be an accident at work and which will already be the status of housing trauma," the expert advises.
J. Kristianjūn says that during these times when the work functions are often entirely sufficient for computer and mobile telephone and stable Internet connections, the employee will not need to work at the place specified in the agreement and at the time specified.
Workers are mobile, they can choose to work not at home that day, but by making coffee in a coffee shop or a park while enjoying the sun.
It's going to be a job, isn't it?
What if the working hours discussed are not yet in line with the agreement provided for?
It can be very difficult to deal with situations that help explain the circumstances of the investigation, initiated by Sodros or State Labour Inspections, - a positive specialist.
In their view, the main difference in the financial sense between the event's work and the amount of unemployment allowance is in question.
J. Kristianjun acknowledged that there was an informal hearing of non-malany experience, while employers are trying to hide true adverse events or traumas and try to call on workers to call on doctors not at work, to take responsibility for themselves, thereby financially.
This is unfair, disrespectful attitude toward the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help businesses in similar situations: this is also a risk of civil liability for the employer for damage to workers, the accident prevention of injury, inadmissibility or even death, as well as relevant and health threats," says J. Kristianun.
The mobile signature system is running again
On Monday, the mobile writing system is again operating in Lithuania, the BNS confirmed the service provider's representatives of the Estonian IT company "SK ID Solutions".
This company reported disturbances on the morning of the first day, the accident experienced by the companies "Bitė", "Telia" customers and part of the "Tele2" consumers.
The difficulties of fixing in Estonia, however, have not been able to comment on the situation in the country.
Lithuanian Regbio Collection - Polish Pamouses
The ‘Trophy’ division of the European Trophy’ is the most difficult thing to do with the Lithuanian Regbian movement as far as it is concerned to compare to the higher level.
The ‘Trophy’ division in the Old Land is a third according to the capacity of the Six Nations tournament and the European Championship.
Here are 13-18 ratings of land command.
The Lithuanian fleet began to sail across the North in the 30.10 front of the Czech army.
And last week, Lithuania's poll in Lodja, where there was no Polish poll - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians were slow to fight, the tribes often violated the rules, and the Polish rebels were brought before them.
Three, 10, 27 and 37 minutes of punishment, Wojciech Piotrovichs gave his own 12 points weight.
In the first column, the Lithuanians had to play without the yellow card received by David Majyl.
A number of attacks were carried out on the second train, but the result was that they were not completed.
At that time, the Greeks were able to overcome the defense of our nation.
In the area included, Matteussa Plichta, followed by Christanas Pogorzelskis and Matthewszas Adamskis.
In addition to several important opponents, the Lithuanian electorate coach from PAR Ntando Manyosha acknowledged the advantage of the rivals and claimed that such desires gave much valuable experience.
"The lines played very well and dominated all the game components.
Our goal was to stay as long as possible in these hopes.
What we just put into this higher level, and we have to understand it.
We won the first prize before the prizes, but now we have a very powerful prize, and we have to recognize their reward.
The Polish electorate has provided us with useful lessons," a specialist from the PAR said, to the Lithuanian electoral train station for four years.
The next round "Trophy" division of Lithuanians will be housed with Portuguese or Romanians on 6 April 2019.
This division is still under attack by the Dutch and Swiss troops.

Japan's coastal archipelago intensively searching for rich islands
Esanbe Hanikata Kojima - such a name was given to a very small island in northern Japan in 2014.
A small, well - prepared and priceless island, which, in fact, was not suitable for life, was very important to Japan.
It is so important that she now has a rich territory that she has a keen eye - is it still happening?
Why does Japan so need this island?
It won't happen.
It is likely that ice and ocean currents have covered this island for all time, although it is still still on the surface of water almost two meters above the surface of the water.
It is almost beyond doubt that the island is simply freezing, but at least it is expected to be found after sunset.
When the island began, no one knew exactly what - it was so drunk that no one was too much of it and hated it.
The first of these was the introduction of Esanbe Hanikat Kojima to Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as a means of visual navigation.
Their disappearance is not even a tragedy for these fish, as there are better ways to catch where they can be fished and where Russian waters begin to fight.
That was the case with Esanbe Hanikat Kojima.
This dry soil was the very night of Cyrus ’ wilderness.
This island’s coastal coast, which Russia calls the Kuril Islands, and Japan - the Northern Territories.
The conflict with these obstacles has continued since the mid - 19th century, but at the age of 20.
In these areas there are natural resources, but Japan has historically believed that the islands should belong to it.
The need for Japan to examine these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They first made the map, took further studies, and recorded many small islands.
The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that the latter were in line with Sakhalin and Japan - all the islands of the Kurillas.
So these two states were born until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Sakhalin to Japan.
In 1945 the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and extended the island of Kuril.
Japan, inside and outside, does not mean great claims throughout the island, although it was the first, but it would like to have four islands - Europe, the Kunas, the Shikotan Islands and the Chabomayas.
Japan feels that it has a historic right because the island has been first discovered, and it belongs to Japan in accordance with the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan invited Russia to share these four islands at a level, but Russia did not even consider adopting such a proposal.
Japan is almost close to the Northern Territories, but now this geographical connection is now being lost.
Dingo is a physical symbol of Japan’s presence in those waters.
It's a big loss, so we're looking for the rest of the island.
However, even after they have been found by Esanbe Hanikat Kojima, they will not comply with the simple definition of the island - this must be a mystery.
This means that the territory of Japan will gradually be reduced and the exclusive economic zone, calculated from the newspapers, will be reduced.
I'm just wondering what the island's search mission looks like - it's definitely not going to fall or fall like this.
An incredible drama in the Lithuanian and Polish box elections
More than a week had to wait for the final award of judges who had become the international meeting between the Lithuanian and the Polish boroughs.
In Poland, nine lakes and two Lithuanians were gathered.
The four accused won the Lithuanians, both the Lithuanians and the Soviets.
The final decision of the Chamber of Justice and the Chamber of Appeals, which was a long-standing debate and debate, led to the final conclusion of the decision.
The election was launched by Lithuanian boxers.
On several occasions the Lithuanian champion Marius Vishniauskas (the category of weight up to 52 kg) assured that 3:0 defeated Jacob Surma, shortly after Edgar Scurdelis (about 60 kg) defeated Radomir Obrušnik after the defeat of battle 2:1.
The following two families followed: Damiana Durkaczas (about 64 kg) 3:0 touched Manta Duzin, and Philip Wachala (about 69 kg) proclaimed Simon Banah.
The weight of the Lithuanian elections was returned to Vytutas Balsy (up to 75 kg).
Titus 2:1 killed Bartose Golebievsky.
In the second battle, Piotras Szczukowkis (about 81 kg) in the third round had a clear crossover effect on Egypt’s Kasmos and the result was again at 3:3.
He followed the brothers closely.
Robert Jokulys (91 kg) 3:0 killed Andrzejs Colton, and Arvydas Jokulys (91 kg) already had to acknowledge Adam Kukuli's prophecy in the first row.
The majority of the discussions took place in Tado Tamashausko (about 91 kg) and Michael Soczynski's battle.
The publication of the final outcome of its cross-border meeting was delayed more than a week.
One judge assigned a transfer to the branch, two lawyers to Lithuania, but due to the technical error of one judge to Lithuania, a point was read to Mr Soczynski.
After a long debate, the victory left for the Polish boxer - 2:1.
At a meeting of the Lithuanian and Polish electoral councils, the outcome of the victory was 10:8 (now 2 points) for family members.
They were able to expose the Lithuanians for the tragic loss of their previous mutual mother.
In 2015, at a meeting in Marijampolė, the Lithuanian boxers won even five of the six and won the winner's score at 10:2.
The Lithuanian electoral leaders meeting in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian Box Championship held in Šilutė on 14-17 November.
After the country's priorities, a new Lithuanian box will be set up, which will bring the country's glory to the world and European champions next year.
How does a bird determine which course of action a person should take?
You already know the dog's neck is very sensitive.
They may be infected with hidden explosives, drugs, blood, and other animals, some of which may even be known as fungi.
Very well - known and filmed birds, but their work is much harder than you think.
How do they determine what the master of the flock is doing?
In fact, this is something more difficult than you think.
The eight of the seven is composed of three stages - the formation, the setting of the direction and the eye.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, since it is difficult to decide what course a person has taken.
No step has been taken for more than a second, so their noise is not so much different, is it?
Not at all.
In 1990, the Oslo University study described experiments in which the dog was brought 90 degrees to the trajectory that passed by the man.
Tests to be performed on the stomach and on the asphalt.
And in many cases, the dog easily determined the human course of action, even when he tried to expose them to past rebirths.
Can you imagine what a difficult assignment this would be?
The difference between the current current position is very small and in time it decreases even further.
However, scientists say that this is no longer so changed - the birds could say and which part of the foot would have left the ground first.
This is because their port is an incredible tool.
The forest is dominated by the responsible areas of the port (as our smegenys dominate by the region responsible).
Dogs have 125-300 million quap receptors.
In general, dogs have at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but their ability to interpret different shapes plays an even greater role.
Scientists then performed analogous experiments and with the left foot, but the dog was much more difficult to follow.
This is because biking cancers are not segmented as a current human foot, so it is more difficult to isolate different places for comparison - it is not natural for dogs, so more time is needed.
True, dogs are not the strongest owners of the ports.
This title will be used as soon as possible.
A hundred miles [100 km] of white holes follow the ready bed, and the red holes reach the animal’s back some 30 miles [30 km].
Private forests require regulation of shelters
Minister of the Environment Kęstutis Navick will explain on the second day of the Seime on forest degradation.
At the end of the summer, the lack of public satisfaction was due to forests in the Labanoro regional park.
The harvest of these forests was stopped for the month.
The Minister has acknowledged that the investigation of rapes in Labanore has shown that there has been no serious infringements.
However, the Ministry of the Environment, having regard to the proposal of the Working Group to strengthen forest degradation in forests of the State, has already introduced the limits.
The Minister calls for other legislation to be drawn up to the end of the year.
The same restrictions are intended to be applied in public forests and private forest management.
Agnė Jjaelavicė opened up a strategy as it subjugated 170 thousand followers
People need to give what they want, and at the same time get what they want, in the LRT television show "Cultural with Nomeda" says Agnė Jjaelavicė.
At the end of the stylists, she had little respect for me.
"From the beginning, it's good to get to a man's dog, to stand by himself, and for a while running after that knife," says A. Jjalavićė.
A. Jajalavićiūtė has more than 170 thousand followers - she has achieved this number by using a certain strategy: "From the beginning, I've been attracted to a man's dog, step by itself, running after a while."
Stylist A. Jjavalavičūtė has a positive sense of uncertainty and therefore shows its appearance as it is, the authenticity and ability to find the best way to present is the most important criteria for popularity in social networks.
It notes that social networks are not left behind by human culture, because many interns turn away from them in order to reach or read the comments of some other people who are infatuated: "For example, there was an age when I wanted to date with everyone and change - now I don't want to do that."
"Uncertain life is the worst thing.
And there is a lot of this on social networks.
Feisbuke is much less than instagram," she says.
A. Jajalavićūtė, a teacher of interior design and art education, says a specific knowledge sent on social networks - about women's emancipation.
It also announces the production of newspapers and also considers creation in its work.
"I can't say that the blue magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know it's a lot there.
I hope there's a lot of creativity in my work, as well as cleanliness.
I'm balanced - that's my character to those big numbers.
I don't want to make a living.
Where there is something better to give people what they want, and try hard to get what they want themselves," says A. Jjaelavicėtė.
One of the most difficult events for young people is classical music concerts.
Their popularity has been enhanced by the proposal of a well - known person through life history: to talk about the dead, the failure, the living experiences, and so on by the authentics.
As such a strategy, A. Jägelevićė offers to apply to all cultures.
According to them, without any performance, without any promotion and showing certain values, there are no cultural opportunities.
"How's the teacher in charge of the students - is there a chance?
If we don't have a certain way to deliver that message, we don't advertise, we're not going to do anything.
When we're true and we're the last reader - maybe someone's gonna change.
I've seen one, the other, the third, and the already independent," she shares her views.
Three people were hit by a bomber in Lithuania on the north side of June
On the seventh day after an accident north of June, three people began searching in Alaska.
One man was saved after a five - day disaster, and the other three were unable to find him.
The storm struck near Lithuania’s shores, north of June.
It was found that it was "Airbus H125" on a remote route to Grand Prerière, Texas.
On Friday, 100 feet from the shores of the ship were collected.
According to Associated Press, one rescuer was 14 years old.
It was reported that she experienced mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
We wrote two adults and two teenagers in the army.
According to KTVA, David King (53 C.E.), Josh Pepperdas (42 C.E.) and Andrew Pepperdas (11).
It has been established that Pepperdas is the director of the Ailiasko construction company "Davis Constructors & Engineers".
I don't know what's going on.
The National Transport Security Council submitted that the investigation had been initiated.
"I'm going to blow up a firefight that was completely new – only from the factory – two adults and two adults are out of range," says the report of the coastal security officials, based on the CTVA.
It was found that the pilot had been experienced for 40 years by flying fixed gears and aircraft, including flights to Alaska.
According to Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeffs Brodsky told them that the neighbors “have not yet understood the hope of a miracle.”
With the help of the coastal guard, the rescuers renewed their search for alpines who had suffered in Scotland on 17 February 2016 on Mount Nevis in Fort Viljame, Scotland.
On the seventh day, three people were found in Alaska, following the terrorist attack.
"I have experienced sexual violence"
President Kelyannea Conway revealed an experience of sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway praised the sharp struggle between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, who was a candidate for the Supreme Court, and his prosecutor, Dr. Christine's Blasey Ford.
Conway was pleased to discover that he himself had experienced sexual violence, and he condemned B. Kavanaugh before leader Jake Taberus by claiming that the judge charged with sexual abuse by ignoring the negative facts of the charges.
"I am very touched by the victims of sexual harassment and violence.
I've even experienced sexual harassment," Conway said to CNN on Sunday, "State of the Union".
"I'm a victim of sexual violence and I don't think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take'a Tapperis, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for this.
We must be responsible for our conduct."
Conway said that the news networks must be a guide to Kavanaugh's comparison with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in prison in the state of Pennsylvania last week.
Conway also criticized the Senate's judicial committee because it was unable to remove former President Bill Clinton, who committed oral sex in his office and abused American people.
The hearing showed that the demonstrations of Kavanaugh and Ford split the U.S. society
The Americans disagree on the testimony of Bretto Kavanaugh and his defendant Christine Blasey Ford – the prosecutor argues that the judge had sex with her when they were adults.
Considering that Ford or Kavanaugh is lying, the number is nearly doubled: 38 per cent of the respondents claim that Kavanaugh was the fastest or most likely to receive evidence, and 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
The Court of Justice heard a letter sent by Ford to Senator Diane Feinstein with a detailed condemnation of the judge.
After writing a letter, Ford, and Kavanaugh said he was ready to speak to the committee.
According to the evidence, Ford claimed 100 percent to be true that at the beginning of the 9th century, she was tried by Kavanaugh, not by another person.
In an emotionalized language, 51 - year - old women said that they felt civil service, so they could not get away with it.
"I'm very scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think my civil duty is to tell me what happened when Brittas Kavanaugh and I went to high school."
Ford and two other women accused of sexual abuse, Kavanaugh said that “there has never been anything sexual in high school, college or ever since”.
"All the way you could try to find something that would hinder you from voting for my appointment, no matter how unrealistic or dirty it is," he said.
"It's just the last minute of a smile."
On 27-28 September, a survey carried out by YeuGov, during which 2607 people were interviewed, did not show a distinction between the opinions of different parties: Democrats more believed in Ford (73 per cent) and the republics (74 per cent), although ford showed more faith in republics than in Kavanaugh (14 per cent compared to 11 per cent).
The founder of the "Body Worlds" exhibition called "Daktar Mortimi" wants to be updated and demonstrated in its own exhibition
The German scientist who invented the explosion wanted to become an age-old member of his "Body Worlds" show.
Guntheris von Hagens has adopted a innovative method that allows for demonstration of laveries, cassettes and organs around the world in the exhibition, entertainment and entertainment, and counter-assessment.
After his death, a 73 - year - old man told the people that he would become a permanent exhibit in the "Body Worlds" exhibition, which will be opened this week in London.
"In that sense it will be the end of his life's work.
Now I understand that I have to do this because I have expressed my recognition and love," said Angelina Whalley to the newspaper “The Observer”.
She said that the man gave strong instructions on what to do with his boat and that the whole process would end for about a year.
The muscles, nerves and arteries must be removed and the body must be disposed of and built in the required condition.
"He said to me, "Angelina, you can burn me to 25 degrees a year, but after that you will have to add your hand, and I'll break it."
So, I can do it for years, then I'll have to do it."
Then, in the most perfect case, he will join the show near London's side of the show with other bodies, who have been stuck in standing positions, such as riding horses or playing cards.
Von Hagens was the first to fly in the United Kingdom via direct British television (this was the first public flight over 170 years).
Body Worlds has visited more than 47 million people worldwide since 1995.
“Body Worlds London” author Peters Tabernalis told The Guardian that 100 percent of the exhibitions using about 28,000 square feet were presented by the gifted people who “recorded because they wanted to help the living, light them and help them see possible problems”.
“We see and read so many terrible things that we deserve death.
No one will escape it, death is common to all of us, and I think that "Body Worlds" shows that there is no need to be afraid," Tabernalis said.
Ronaldo's lawyers are exorbitant with a court search for charges of exaggerating
The Portuguese football star, Christian Ronaldo's lawyer, said on Friday that the German newspaper, which issued a "explosively illegal" US claim that Ronaldo was banned in 2009.
One of Ronald's lawyers, Christas Schertzas, claimed that the article “Der Spiegel” was an “unacceptable declaration of private charges” and he would, by legal means, seek to repay the magazine to his client.
The statement was sent to the Reuters by Ronaldo’s representative, Gestifute, in response to the request to comment on the five-day article “Der Spiegel” published on the Internet.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of the Der Spiegel statement, which Reuters could not automatically verify.
Der Spiegel first announced charges in April 2017.
One of the most popular sportsmen in the world, Ronaldo won the title of the world’s best player five times.
This summer he moved to "Juventus" from "Real Madrid"; the Italian club refused to comment on the "Der Spiegel" statement.
The newspaper reported that the alleged arrest took place in the rooms of Las Vegas in June 2009 – this was said by Kathryn's Mayorga lawyer Leslie Mark Stovallas.
Stoval told the newspaper that Ronaldo and Mayorga agreed that we were not in court.
Mayorg agreed to sign a confidentiality contract for Ronald paid $375 000.
The studio did not immediately respond to Reuters e. mails about comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls from the house.
However, Stovalla told the newspaper "Der Spiegel" that he filed a civil complaint in order to cancel a confidentiality contract.
The Mayorg newspaper Der Spiegel said that the contract did not end because it still feels the consequences of the night before nine years ago.
"I survived a serious crisis," she said "Der Spiegel".
“And yet, the charge of exaggerating.
I'll curse him and blame myself for signing it."
Sustainable business to ensure the independence of the Creator
Are you ready to try Self-Publishing 3.0?
The new White Paper, published by the Association of Independent Creators today on the "#selfpub3.0" website, explains for the first time in detail how to join other entrepreneurs, become independent and start a sustainable creation business.
The Association of Independent Creators establishes Orna Ross, which has already been recognised for the first time by one of the 100 most influential people at the Digital Book World 2018 conference, explains why creators should be allowed by Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
‘The sales trends, e.g. the popular personal brands of goods responsible for the use and reading on mobile phones, along with digital publishing technologies, create very favourable conditions for business of the creators’, says Ross.
However, these opportunities can only be used by independent and creative thinkers and their powerful creators who understand the value of intellectual property.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages the creation of a number of employment sources through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and publishing.
It is possible to obtain direct sales, pre-numbered models, complex assistance, wide dissemination models and other sources of income, e.g. online training and related entity activities.
"#subpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in the most diverse formats for audiences using minority and other services.
The main objective of "#selfpub3.0" is to encourage changing thinking and learning to manage your creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important natural property, would not be transferred without a transfer to another company, such as a specialized driver or a self-service provider.
According to Ross, such creationists can increase their income, capacity and impact, and in these methods they must bring not only every digital age creator, but also the authors; it also stressed that true independence is guaranteed by the commercial and creative freedom of all creations (as well as by others).
I'll be right here.
And its perspective is now the best for independent creations.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes the computer release and printing according to the claim.
Self-Publishing 2.0 theme is the sale of books for books and telephones in online bookstores.
Now it begins a new, Self-Publishing 3.0 era, where self-employed publishers will learn to start a business of perspectives and sustainability.
The Association of Independent Creators is the only global non-profit organization that unites writers who allow their own books.
The aim of the Union is to develop the skills of self-employed persons, promote ethical activities, help beginners to sell books and encourage the creation of a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
The Presidents of the Party and the Central Bank warned the Italian Government of the planned deficit
Following the popular government plans to significantly increase deficits next year, the Italian president and the central bank manager warned on the sixth day that the country's debt should be managed.
On Thursday evening, the ruling party (oppossive movement of five stars and the right North Pole) presented a proposal for a deficit of 2019, which would target 2.4 per cent of the total domestic product (BVP) and three times the previous administrative objective.
This report touched the market on Friday and encouraged the sale of bonds and made it hard for bank shares.
Moreover, such plans do not harmonize with the European Union, which applies EU fiscal rules and monitors their compliance.
At the hearings of the President's Chambers mentioned in the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, President Sergio Mattarella recalled that under the country's basic laws, the budget must be balanced and the debt managed.
"So we protect our citizens' savings," he said
A few years later, at a central conference in Italy, the President of the Italian Bank Ignazio Visco said that the country’s debt, which is the largest of all the major economies in the European Union, cannot be further increased and has reached 131 per cent of GDP.
"It must give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," said Visco, according to the state agency Ansa.
"The school must be consistently reduced."
The head of the north level and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvinis responded to Mattarella's words that the school had grown to apply the strict requirements of Brussels for a year.
"Remember, Mr President," said Salvinis in the statement.
"The government debt has been reduced for years to the budgets of Europe, we are finally changing plans and we are reaching a better future and growth."
Earlier, before calling Mattarella or Visco, the leader of the Five-star movement, Luigi Di Mayo, said that the money would be returned to people in advance," but added that the government was not going to oppose the EU or the financial markets.
The ruling party urged the non-group economy minister Giovanni Tria to support their planned deficits.
The Italian media claimed that Mattarella supported Tria's failure to maintain a budget deficit which would not reach 2 per cent of GDP.
The Presidents of the Party and the Central Bank are not directly affected by economic policy.
The 77-year-old President may reject the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then adopt and enforce an unchanged law again.
Official information: Indonesia Cunamite sensitivities have missed a great battle
The Indonesian Geophysics Agency rejected the warning about tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and then a terrible earthquake struck, which left thousands of people without their homes on the northeastern coast of the island of Sulawesi, where hundreds of people were killed.
Car rental in Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018
During the 7.5 earthquake and tsunami, about 1,500 km (940 miles) from the city of Palu in Jakarta, at least 384 people were killed.
On Sunday, officials claimed that the number of victims was the fastest.
On Friday, the crowd gathered to the festival at Palu’s swimming pool, where there were plenty of six feet [18 feet] lost.
On the sixth day of BMKG, the Geophysics Agency received criticism in the social media: many people wondered whether the warning about tsunami had not been rejected earlier.
The Agency claimed that it had carried out a standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning on the basis of the latest wave sensor of 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
‘We do not have surveillance data from Palu.
Therefore, we had to make a decision on the data we had," said the head of the BMKG earthquake and tsunami centre Rahmata Triyon.
The most recent wave scale measuring sea level changes was only determined by its claim to be an "improper" inch (2.5 cm) in length (2.5 cm) and not to be seen by a munitions band near Palu.
“If we had a swimming pool near Palu or the data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
We have to think about it in the future," Triyon said.
According to officials, the tsunami struck Palau and surrounding areas at a speed of 100 kilometers an hour, but it was not clear whether it occurred before or later.
Residents check the lavender on the street looking for their family members after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, on 29 September 2018.
"On the basis of the video posted in the social media, we believe that the tsunamis took place before the official withdrawal of the warning," Triyon said.
The most serious damage occurred on the second day of July 2004, when the quake struck 9.5 balsam soil and caused a massive tsunami that killed about 226,000 people on the Indian river coast, including 126 000 in Indonesia.
The beautiful city of Palu, where 380,000 people live, is located on the narrow shores of the Sulawesi island in the north.
According to Indonesia’s National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), the tsunami struck the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to the University of Oxford geophysics researcher Baptiste Gomberto, earthquakes were not to cause tsunamis.
The 5th day earthquake occurred due to horizontal flooding, the speeding of the tetanus surface, not to the vertical, as usual for tsunamis.
"It is believed that there was a flood in the sea, a flood of water and a flood," he said, adding that the force of the coastal waves could be concentrated in the black hole.
The representative of the disaster relief agency Sutopo's Purwo's Nugroho's correspondents said that his team “has prepared to send easily understandable public warnings” when the warning of a tsunami was rejected.
According to the Ministry of Communications, the residents were familiar with the text sent again with warnings, but Nugroho said that the electricity and communications lines of the ground were stopped and the newspaper was not closed by the Syrians.
In the social media, the Indonesians questioned whether BMKG had to withdraw the warning about tsunami and pointed out that the information had not been submitted in time.
"I'm late... The warning has been rejected... and the tsunamis have always occurred..." @zanoguccy user @sangoukcy sent a well-known BMKG.
Golf: Mollywood's duet is about to lose ticket sales records
On Saturday's fourth anniversary, Francesco's Molinaris and Tommy's Fleetwood became the first two of Europe's most celebrated parties, and it will soon be recorded in history, as Europe is already the first result of 10:6 before the end of Ryder Council.
After defeating Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau's score 5:4, they became the first European pair to win all four matches.
Only the Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins were able to do this in 1979.
The disturbing results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show not everything.
On three occasions, 14 important titles were won by Woods and twice won by Patrick Reed.
They also won a victory over the Jordans of Spieth and Justin Thomas, the US commander of this week, who won three other victories.
Molinaris and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five out of five on Sundays.
Fleetwood has already won most of the points of the Ryder Council of the units as a new European.
The couple who received a new set of sails from Mollywood, from the first sight, did not seem to be able to move the European team forward.
In Ryder's story, the novelists, such as Fleetwood, did not believe in such an appearance, and Molinaris did not win one of the previous six cats, and in the four of them he was shot.
However, there was also hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year known as Le Golf National as its five pillars, and here in 2017 it won the French Open tournament and demonstrated a severe temperature during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinaris is a new "British Open" champion and many are considered to be the most consistent football player in the European tournament – this is a useful feature in the front row, where the proud word can be a curse, as the American failure has shown.
These toys and harmonizing games in the garden made them ineffective.
"Now I feel a little so sensitive, but only for six days," Fleetwood said with a loud voice, playing with a wide smile all week long.
This afternoon we showed up very well, we played stable and good.
If we look at the history together, that will be a great achievement.
I'm just glad we worked on the team."
Molinari was also funny.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we have to do our job, not just go to the record books, so we will have to fight hard tomorrow for 4.5 points that we need to pass; it will not be easy."
Ritre's hot!
Ireland’s neighboring Mediterranean Coast
The island of Claregalway in the west of Ireland was once powerful, a 15 - year - old family’s main strength, and this sixth day was remembered for its origin.
Riteria's two soldiers during the mid-term battle festival at Claregalway, Golve, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
A fully restored Anglo-Norman home with a boxed middle-class battle field, where many enthusiasts from all over the world have opened up contact with war and games that were popular centuries ago.
The Riteria, prepared by Karla Dornanas and the king's suit, is patrolled by Donna Dornan in the big town of Claregalway during the mid-term battle festival in Golve, Ireland, on September 29, 2018.
"It's a great weekend trip and something unusual," said Denise Fitzgerald from Kerio's graffiti to the family of the sculptors.
“So we go back to the simplest things.
I'm trying to do everything as necessary," said the theatre worker, taking part in the armed fighting festival for the first time.
The Lauke had a truly defensive fighter, and although their swords were heavy, some of the seeds were comfortable and one was damaged by the dust.
The riders demonstrated their skills by driving and pulling the wheels and bending them across the side.
The metal blades wore weapons, enemy buyers prepared drugs, and the amateur version and broke the wall.
The very next and partially tired participants tried to get involved.
"I think that anyone can look at costumes, but the involvement in the role is mine," said Helena Stackpoole, playing Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald, and having the unique opportunity to use his fashion design knowledge.
“All costumes are sent in hand.
I've been wearing my jacket for two years, and now I'm wearing a jacket and I've only got 800 pearls on her hands.
It's important to me," she said.
Following earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of killings increased to 832
According to the national disaster reduction agency, the number of people killed on the island of the Indonesian Sulawesi increased on the following day to 832 and the affected area is higher than expected at the outset.
The representative of the agency Sutopo's Purwo's Nugroho's press conference said that many people were trapped on the ground floor after a 7.5-ball earthquake, a five-day event and a six-metre (20-foot) high tsunami.
The FBI called on the second woman who accused candidate Kavanaugh
FTB agents, investigating the U.S. Supreme Court of Bretto Kavanaugh's case, called on a second woman who was subjected to sexual harassment – this day this woman's lawyer was released.
The report by Debrah Ramirez, lawyer John Clune, states that the FTB is conducting an investigation in Kavanaugh’s case not only after a separate trial of charges presented to the Federal Court of Appeal by Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford at the dramatic Senate meeting this week.
Ramirez owes Kavanaugh to show her his pen at the festival where she was interviewed and who took place at the University of Jeille when they both studied there.
President Donaldas Trumpas gave his consent to the pressure of the Senate's republics and directed the FTB to conduct a study after the fourth session of the Senate, in which Professor Ford of the University of California, Ford, made extensive accusations that Kavanaugh’s attempt to suppress her during the week, in 1982, when both of them were in school and had grown up.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the Baltics limited the scope of the FTB investigation.
The crowd rejected it and announced the Twitter news: "Indeed, I want them to listen to all the people who need their attention."
The White House representative Raj Shahas said that Senatas determined the extent and duration of the FTB study (the study must be completed within a week).
"Baltic rooms allow agents to do what they are taught," said Shah.
United Kingdom after Brexito will not meet environmental or animal protection standards
Environment Minister Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom will not compromise environmental or animal protection standards so that trade negotiations can be concluded after Brexito.
Michael Gove, Secretary of State of the British Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, arrived in Daungo Street London on 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conference of the Conservative Party, Gove said it would be useful for the United Kingdom to know about its quality food products and government to publish the food strategy in these years.
Europe restored Ryder's table in units trading
Francesco's Molinaris won the prize on Sunday by returning the Ryder table to Europe: the Italian defeated Phil Mickelson at the 16th point of duty and worked, helping to achieve the desired 14.5 results.
Mickelson gave up his first boat to the water, and when he was able to remain in the threshing floor, Molinaris became the first European to win all five coins a week, although he did not win one of the previous six.
The European transition has already been ensured that the Italians have gone out of the start area and the ground crossing has missed one point, while Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia have first met and has been secured at least half the point.
At the beginning of the day they had first score 10:6 and had to win four and a half points out of possible 12, so that they could restore trophies and confirm their hospitality in homes, which have been held since 1993.
Just two times before this, the teams were able to eliminate the difference between four points and win the units: this was done by the U.S. team in 1999 in Bruckline and Europe in 2012 with the Media Watch, but no one was ever able to come back again.
Justinas Thomas, Webbas Simpson and Tony Finau's teams gave Jim Furyko teams hope to win the first shots, but then the European team points went through the whole area.
Thorbjorn Olisena troubled Jordan Speeth, and his team friend, young Jonas Rahmas – Tiger Woods: 14 important titles won the winner four times.
The best Ryder player Ian Poulter received what was good, most of the ovaries this week, when the world's best player Dustin Johnson shot him in the 18th floor and prayed to Europe for victory.
Then it was time to find out which game ended first, and this was a Molinary game, which brought joy to the mini, which was the greatest in the history of the event.
RT World News: German police protected Erdogan as a code
According to the local media, hiding the officials in East Germany, this week protecting Turkish President Erdogan during his visit to Berlin, using the name of an alien who has been the victim of a non-unionist extremist.
The Ministry of the Interior of the Region said that the Saksonian Land Crime Police in the East were investigating two members of the SEK of the elite anti-terrorism unit.
The men were intended to protect Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long journey to Germany.
The officials had to work secretly, so they had to use the code name under the protocol.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt – a crazy non-unionist who belonged to a group of extremists of the National Socialists (NSU) who, at the beginning of this year, killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
The local media report informs that a change in the name of the code is known when two police officers have requested permission to obtain internal documents necessary to carry out the task.
The presiding officer was late and dismissed the police.
The leader of the Saxon Criminal Police, Petricas Kleine, first appeared in the news.
He said that the decision to use the name Boehnhardt was "probably the most appropriate" and thus "explainly ignored the victims and their loved ones".
Minister for Internal Affairs of Saxony Roland Wolleris endorsed this statement and called the decision “study, fear and totally unacceptable”.
The five-day visit to Erdogan in Berlin led to many conflicting assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticized for accepting a leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit was of great importance, “but if there are no agreements, they need to be resolved on a personal basis. ”
The public was first heard about the NSU in 2011 when the bodies of Boehhardt and his partner, Uwe Mundlos, were found in the dockyard in East Germany.
One of them was thought to have killed the other and then killed after a failed attempt to round the bank in Eisenacho.
The last life remaining Beate'a Zschaepe was soon taken as a third member of the non-union group.
In July of this year, the German court sentenced her to ten life sentences.
She refused to participate in the murder, but her lawyer said that the accused felt morally guilty because she was not trying to stop the killings.
After the UN scandal, the German security agency received a lot of criticism.
Justices, activists, and victims believed that the group had a lot more members.
It has also been shown that the German internal surveillance agency BfV has infiltrated many informants into the NSU and has been permanently prevented from investigating the group involved in killings, killings and massacres.
Muscas is running from Tesla's manager's duties and will have to pay a fine of $20 million to the Securities and Markets Commission
Elona Muskas agreed with the U.S. Securities Commission and the jury, which brought him to the court on Twitter's theft of the information he claimed in Tesla's private company.
Muscas will have to be removed from the leadership's duties, but the Director-General will remain.
The documents of the Agreement indicate that Muskas, President of the Tesla Board of Directors, has to be removed within 45 days and will be prohibited from returning to these duties for three years.
In addition, he will have to pay $20 million fine.
It all started with Twitter, which was unscathed or some mistyped, and therefore Muska will have to receive prior approval before any statement or announcement of Tesla "no format, including, but not limited to social media (e.g. "Twitter"), company website (e.g. company network), press reports and phone calls to investors".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million, because it has not checked Moscow's original Twitter news.
On 7 August, Muskas was accused of investing in securities and the jury's complaint on Twitter, where he received funds in order to make Tesla a private company worth $420 – so the company's securities are worth more than 10 per cent.
The musca soon withdrew his words saying that Tesla would remain public and drowned investors.
The Commission on securities and the jury decided that the original statement of Musko was “unjust and misleading because it did not support the facts”.
According to the Muskas newspaper, this error can be justified: after meeting with the representative of the independent Saudi Arabia fund, he was surprised that he was able to make a deal with the money.
It is reported that the Moscow Commission and the Securities and Markets Commission have been in favour of a lower sentence – Moscow would have to reject the president's position for only two years and should not have to acknowledge the scale, but Muskas rejected this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, Tesla’s price of securities was high and, as soon as possible, changed its opinion and agreed with stricter conditions.
However, according to the new agreement, as with the old one, Musk does not need to recognize the blame for the mistake of investors.
Aleksandrian patriots committed to support the Canary Islands Church and requested the unity of the Orthodox Church
Aleksandrian patriarch Theodorus II appealed on the basis of the canon of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which belongs to the patriarch of Moscow.
He responded to the resignation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the patriarchate of Constantinople.
On Thursday, the Theodorus arrived in the city of Odes in the south of Ukraine and met with the highest church representatives and religious orthodoxys.
Aleksandrian patriot is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchies, which only leads to the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople.
"I am here to tell you: do not reject the Orthodox faith and canon churches," said the patriarch Theodorus II.
Before his visit to Odes, he met with the Polish Orthodox metropolis Savva, who also supported the canonic Church of Ukraine.
I was also urged to prevent conflicts that led to attempts to justify the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
"We will always support those who seek orthodox unity," said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church has recently experienced a major crisis following the decision of Constantinople patriots to recognize the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow patriot.
Constantinepolis decided to send exorcism to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting a single Orthodox church to carry on with other demands.
Egzarchai are special patriarchal representatives, formally serving a higher position than the Metropolis Onupriy, who is now the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which belongs to Moscow's patriarchate.
Moscow's patriarchate took action in Constantinople and withdrew from all the church councils and members of the organizations which were led by or together by the representatives of Constantinople.
However, it is claimed that Constantinople was warned not to take any other countermeasures and that both churches were not considered to have completely terminated their alliances.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one church is recognized as the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the Moscow patriot.
The majority of Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separate churches – the church of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Kijevo patriocharchat, which was established in the 10th century.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal leader, Filaret, who seeks the recognition of the official Orthodox Church, full independence and equality with the patriarch of Moscow.
Damascus opened its first trade in Syria-Jordan for the first time in three years
According to the SANA State News Agency, the Syrian government has claimed to open the border crossing the Nasib border in Jordan, which has been closed for three years because of war in this territory.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side spread land to the city of Dara.
Nasibas is the most important link between trade and not only between neighbouring countries but also between Lebanon and Persia.
Most important thoughts from Lavrvo JT
In his visit to the Russian Foreign Minister Sergeius Lavrovas to the West for "political and brutal forces" and said that diplomacy should not be imposed on dictators and unilateral sanctions.
On Friday at the UN General Assembly, the Minister said that some Western countries are trying to maintain their “own-appointed positions of world leaders” without pressure from others.
He did not mention specific countries, but said that they used “political scandal, economic pressure and brutal force”.
The world has to pay a high price for a small group of countries' own selfish ambitions.
Lavrov, a ten-year representative of Russia of the United Nations, said that the culture of diplomacy and trade changed, and the unilateral sanctions applied without the approval of the United Nations.
The Minister said that the sanctions applied in many countries are "unlawful or ineffective" and the primary blockade applied for Cuba for many years.
"But the story didn't pay us anything," Lavrovs said, adding that "Vakar's kidnappers will only be able to catch the cat if it's "very likely".
Let us remember how often such unjustified charges have been justified by the rape and war, such as the 1999 explosion in Yugoslavia, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the invasion of Libya in 2011.
Of course, Lavrovs did not mention all the West Invasion and the first of the seven years of Syria’s war as one of the most recent cases.
The failure of the extremism attempt to convert the Damascus regime could have been humiliating to the whole country and open the possibility of entering the ‘territory caliph’.
Lavrova has improved the peace process that Russia, Turkey and Iran launched at the same time and has said that this process has helped to prevent the Islamic state (IS, previously called ISIS) and other groups that want to occupy Syria as a whole.
It is now most important to restore the places of the war and to help refugees return safely to their homes.
Lavrova returned to the struggle of great powers and said that the United Nations was actually created “the ones that are free from the Second World War”.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs stressed that in 2018 he was joining the 80-year-old "guarantee" Munich Treaty signed in 1938, which France and Great Britain agreed to allow the nations to abandon the German-born part of Czechoslovakia to defeat Hitler.
Although British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlains said that the Munich Treaty “has brought peace to these times”, the war began a year later.
München's invention shows how it can further eliminate "country selfishness and international law"," Lavrovs said.
"The Colonian Eros Diptate and the barrier must be made available to the historical archives or the archives."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the world's problems, Lavrov said.
“If you have any questions or doubts, sit down and talk, explain the facts, listen to your colleague’s arguments and try to reconcile interests.”
Chris's holy aky?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are migla, and Bibi is headed for Iran
In the General Assembly language, the Prime Minister of Israel stated that Tehran has a secret nuclear weapon.
The other guilty Israelites may have been hiding something.
"Give" Israel's favorite prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu released the news on Thursday – showed from high-fashioned photos with places where Iran is likely to be using nuclear materials.
Tehran replied that Tel Aviv would rather take care of its “undeclared nuclear weapons programme”.
Although Israel has never recognized (but has not) the possession of nuclear weapons, RT journalist Muradas Gazdiev has tried to explain whether Tel Aviv should actually seek refuge in his own age.
Government of Scotland: No complaints against Alexo Salmondo before January
The Scottish government claimed that by January of this year, no complaints against Alexo Salmondo had been filed.
The first month of January, the minister was sentenced to two sexual assaults, although he was severely denied.
He was informed of the investigation in March.
Samsalda, who was released from the Scottish National Party, was charged with the Scottish Government for the complaint against him.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first considered in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been filed by January.
The representative of the Scottish government said: “The Scottish government filed two complaints against Alexo Salmondo in January.
We could ignore them or hide them.
Earlier that year, the Deputy Prime Minister did not raise any complaints about Alexo Salmondo, and, as we have already said, the first minister heard a survey from Alexo Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legality of our processes, and we will reciprocate our position.
The Scottish Government will try to obtain as much information as possible.
However, as we have already said, we cannot now comment on the case of Mr. Salmando for legal reasons."
“ We have no comment, ” said the representative, “because our request to the permanent secretary is now under discussion at the court meeting and we hope that a decision will be taken soon.
We'll talk to the court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
"Dragons" score 29:13: "Warriors" player Lee Jones's question
Glazga restored the winner title in the "Guinness Pro14" league by winning additional points and defeating "Dragons" Scotstown stadium, and coach Dave's Rennies is not blind to satisfaction, but I think the game could be more accurate.
After the unexpected loss of Southern Kings, the team of Port Elizabeth last six days asked Rennie's well-changed team to examine it and although she was able to collect the necessary points so that it could remain at the A conference, the winding and winding air was certainly not smooth.
"Manau, this morning we had a great fight, we played in the area we needed, and our strategy was good," Rennie said.
"We have to play more precisely and we have been able to use more opportunities.
The measures were unacceptable.
We have created many opportunities and we have enjoyed it.
It needs to be played more precisely, but 40 or 50 points won today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We have won additional points, but the next week we have to work harder at home with Zebre and another week with Saracens in Europe."
Although the war had been fought, the Glazgo team had earlier begun to win points, but the TMO created all lost Huwo Jones' balls, including his wounded internal transmission of Niko Matawalu in the chosen camp.
The decline was not long past: the left column of Olis Kebble's fourth minute passed in the middle, and Adam Hastings made the year easy.
Dragons reduced the difference when Arwels Robson received the sentence, and the security won the other player from 20 minutes later and the winning score won.
On the shortest side of the front row, almost half an hour's mark was won: Glazgo's platoons consistently broke the Dragons line, and then the judge from South Africa's Sturitas Barry's 22 minutes was sentenced to the death penalty for the shelter on the Hastings side.
"Warriors" came to the castles, but lost the boat after the crossing, because some of the hard-earned coast of Matavalu could not control the truck and it was transferred to the left.
The second test was performed two minutes after the interval: Hastings has promulgated the Dragons line and wisely transferred the bullet to Lee Jones.
The camels were returned to Hastings to his position and the result of the hunters became 12:6.
On the second side, the first minute was very successful: Alexo Dunbar, who was parked for the second test, was shot by Lee Jones and helped Hastings.
However, "Warriors" failed after failure – just four minutes later they took a ball in the middle of the forest and Adam Warren's centre took it behind the doors, thus winning points, and then Joss Lewis took it after playing an open game with Robson.
Warriors quickly returned to the leading position and 54 minutes after the fourth test won additional points when Huwas Jones left to the right, while Hastings was unable to transfer the car (this was a third failure from the four trials).
Glazgas remained a positive higher position, and a five-minute test took place – Dunbara transferred the ball to George Horne, and Hastings won points.
Kebble's published the best game game, but Rennie's hit Hastings.
“They obviously prevented us from playing, but we did laugh in the middle of the day,” said the coach.
“He lost several meters, but it was cold, and he was still able to get away.
He is good in his ways and he trusts himself."
"Ayr United" won Morton's score 1:5: Ayr's five star family team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore's won two victories, and Declan McDaidas added another and thus helped Ayr stay on the champion's table above.
"Ayr" ran ahead after Shankland's invasion, built from six gardens after Michael Rose's campaign for McDaid.
Morton's 35-minute first test compared the result when Charlie Telfera took the bullet from Robbie Crawford himself and sent it to the Ayr's master, Ross Doohan, to the next country.
Players from the fourth minute of the second round had the chance to move forward when Doohana parked Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidseras left a weak sentence that the manager easily found.
The 74-minute "Ayr" was the second time that the replacement of Craig McGuffie's long distance was delayed and landed on the ground was sent to the deaths of another replacement player, Craig Moore.
Moore's transferred the ship to Shankland in the same minute, which took 17 rounds this season.
When the speakers were laughing, Moore returned to his quarter from the field country, and McDaidas sent a handcuff to the door.
"Alloa" and "Falkirk" end result 0:2: first youth transition in bed
"I rejoice, I feel relief, I am happy," said Ray McKinnon after the very necessary first "Falkirk" victory bed and winning season points.
"Rangers" defeated the champion Zakas Rudden (18 years old) won the victory in both of the castles and threw the family team "Alloa Athletic" into the champion's button and released the club from the bombings.
"It was an important game for us," admitted McKinnon.
“The last three conflicts are likely to increase, so three points have been excellent in the tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It wouldn't be a success, but it was important for us to succeed."
Rudden sent the ball to Patrick Brough for 26 minutes and won the victory from the middle of the door line, when Demanta Petravić slowly pushed the ball over the winner Neil Parry.
"We tried to be firm, but we didn't get it," admitted Jim Goodwins, head of the Wasps.
Hearts sachet petition for semi-final received more than 11,000 letters
The "hearts" surgeon petition for "Betfred" has been signed by more than 11,000 people on the semi-final agenda.
The surgeons are pleased that the two semi-finals are set up on the same day and at the same stage.
The Scottish police, the SPFL last week, decided to hold the Aberdeen-Rangers inspection at 12:00 p.m. and the Hearts-“Celtic – 19:45, as tested by Jambos” and “Dons” surgeons.

On Thursday, the site changed.org published a petition which requires one of the candidates to move to another location or date.

In 31 C.E., Sophie Morey-Brown, Press Association, said: "We have lived here for five years and have never heard of any bad experiences – here is always too far and pleasant to live."
Royal architects and musicians of Hamilton's world light about the King's South III
The project that opened up a large archive of documents obtained during the reign of Jürgi III was believed to help the public learn much better by writing, journals and languages.
Now these documents will reach another audience – the Royal Archives have definitely decided to cooperate with the Vesten Museum.
The academics, who wanted to reveal the true form of the king, invited the music of Hamilton III to review the most important documents from the king’s reign of proproprosene.
The investigators are trying to make an old-fashioned wide-ranging auditory, so they have received a minimum of respect for the exhibitions will be able to obtain digital documents.
Members of the royal family have already publicly accepted the creation of music, while Sasex's Hercoges and Hercogiene will be seen twice, although Prince Hario's speech is always presented in the scene.
Michael Gibson, a playwright of the kings, said that the documents had to be taken into consideration and helped to identify the kings whose image was publicly shaped by the music "Hamiltons", the film "Karaliaus Jurgio" and the series of children "Seaubing History").
"We were surprised by the beautiful letters"
U.S. President Donaldas Trumpas failed to resolve enthusiasm after attempting to reduce tension with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Unu and on the sixth day at his supporters' meeting, he said that after the signing of the letter, he was “swift.”
Mr Trumpas and Mr Kimas said that they were going to reach a nuclear explosion in the South Korea, which they discussed at an unprecedented meeting that took place in Singapore this year.
Before moving to a new stage of history after many years of public disagreement, the leaders of the countries changed with shocks and abuses because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile capable of reaching the United States.
“I was as strict as he was.
We have always regretted it," Mr. Trumpas said at a meeting in West Virginia.
“And then we were surprised, you know?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, beautiful letters."

Skvernel's daughter to Simonyte: Everything decided by the party's "greet"
Prime Minister Saulus Skvernels said that the conservators lacked democracy in the internal markets, and the party's leadership had actually appointed Ingrid Šimonyt at the presidential election.
The very "democratic" Christmas was always a change, freshly saying that when the party's Greek, the superior decided and actively supported one candidate.
Maybe the second candidate had no chance to win even theories," said S. Skvernelis in the government to journalists.
"Conservatives appointed their candidate, with this and we congratulate them," added the premier.
The prime minister of the "Valstites Greens" said that I. Simonytė should be evaluated by the voters, who remembered her work in the Government of the Andris Kubilius.
Mr Skvernellis has not commented on whether he is taking part in the presidential elections.
The Lithuanian Union of States and Greens intends to approve its candidate next year.
Mr Ramón Karbauski, the leader of the "States" Conservatives' elections, called the "unexperimental experiment" because of the activity of the parties.
"First of all, we need to welcome an experiment that has not been fully achieved.
Only 55 per cent of the party's members were involved, of only about 20,000 voters.
Knowing what money needed to be spent on these elections, it is clearly one thing that it didn’t work out," said R. Karbauski to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I think some of the results will not be fair, because the result is none, the party concluded that their candidate will be all right, but whoever spends so much money," he added.
During the internal elections, 79% of the members and their supporters voted in favour of the I. Simonytė's candidate.
Lithuania's wages are funny: one area can change everything
This year, the Baltic Salary Survey organised the results of the study carried out by the Baltic Salary Survey of the Baltic States, the wage of work is mostly rising in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have produced a small amount from their neighboring countries, which is written in the company's press report.
"After 850 companies and the loss of remuneration in the Baltic countries, we see that the monthly remuneration before tax has grown 81.8% in Lithuania this year and the average increase has increased by 7.7 per cent and the annual wage with the annexes is 10.5 per cent.
Latvia has significantly affected us - here is much more than a kilogram of annual remuneration, but as in Estonia, less workers compared with our country," said Paul Blusius, a representative of the company organizing the surveys, adding that with the growth trend of such wages, the economic indicators of the common country should also be taken into account.
Employment in Estonia is growing as quickly as possible
Although wages in Latvia and Estonia were below the wages of fewer workers than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, the annual wage increased by 71 per cent of the employees interviewed and achieved more than 11 per cent in our country.
In Estonia this year, the income of 73 per cent of workers increased by 13 per cent.
Remuneration trends also have a major impact on the labour market, as changing jobs can receive much more remuneration than in the previous workplace.
Those who have not changed jobs and jobs in Lithuania in recent years have increased the annual wage by 8.8 per cent. - more often than in other Baltic countries.
In Latvia, the annual wage growth of such workers was 3.6 per cent, respectively.
Estonia remains a leader in the Baltic countries not only as a medium-term employer but also as long-term employees.
For those who do not change jobs or jobs, the wage is the fastest: the monthly - 6 per cent, the year, including the additions, even 9 per cent.
On the basis of remuneration studies, such trends are often dependent on, or are consistent with, the overall economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policy leading to market trends.
For example, the forecast of a future economic collapse encourages business to behave more cautiously, less investment.
The dominant and fastest growing sector of the country, such as information technologies, buildings, pharmaceuticals, can also generate common statistics and reduce changes.
Maximum tax burden for Latvia
It is important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries in comparison with the growth of remuneration.
In Latvia, employees are paid most of the taxes - even 31 or 34 per cent, which can increase to 42.4 per cent for more workers.
In Lithuania, there is a 24 per cent constant rate, so when there is a higher wage for growth in Latvia, workers can gain the same or even lower share of growth than in Lithuania.
In Estonia, the tax rate is similar to that in Lithuania - 23.6 per cent, so in this country we find the most favourable labour tax in the Baltic countries.
IT - Competitive remuneration
In all Baltic countries, almost regardless of the level of responsibility, the positions of IT specialists remain among the best charges.
The opposite situation in retail trade is the market index in this area, one of the smallest, so employees earn less than the average market income.
In comparison with last year, the rate of pay for plant engineering specialists taking higher positions, as well as risk management professionals.
The growth in this year has not increased and some positions in the IT area have increased by up to 14 per cent to a small part of the organizational information security experts.
In the meantime, the wage for work in retail trade has not changed.
However, some companies have successfully carried out the settlement of remuneration systems, resulting in an annual loan rate of about 2 per cent.
On the basis of remuneration specialists, it is noted that the growth of wage increases and the demand for the most needed specialists - the demand for further analysis of systems in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande is suffering again: the old promise doesn't end
After the divorce with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson, who was diagnosed with breast cancer, continues to suffer from postpartum depression.
By participating in "Saturday Night Live" he chose to laugh about how quickly he fell into serious relationships.
The speakers said that the truth was, just three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete broke off their vows, which took place only after a few months of knowledge.
Pete's tried to create a scenario that mentions his infamous relationship, but it's going to happen in the screen a little later.
It turns out that a humourist, out of his former relationship, knows Aryan himself.
She will suffer from such conditions and not from the heart.

White or red: Which sugar collection is recommended for the diet
White or red?
What's your choice of sugar?
During the hearings, it has been shown that while Lithuanians are still traditionally collecting white sugar, they monitor the fact that many of these peoples, white deaths from the manufactured ingredient have declined.
The sale of sugar has not increased, nor have trade networks representatives.
On behalf of the Maximos representative, red sugar is becoming more popular and popularly buys it even more, although it is usually white sugar - according to the selection, it is even more popular.
In addition, the sale of organic sugar is growing and specialised in the markets of organic products.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to the Diotology, the main difference is price, and the adverse effects on health can be both.
"The raw non-refined sugars are three times more expensive, but in health terms these sugars add to them, while their surplus is harmful to the body," said D. Vaitkeviciūtė.
To live without sugar, a diet is recommended every day to reduce its levels after a while.
This will be done - benefiting from the universe - cold and unwelcome kilograms, improvement and health.
If you use less sugar for a month, it will be easier to give up.
"Every understanding we make is about a month's time, so I'm doing this experiment, to say, a month's time when I'm healing a product without sugar - coffee or bread, we'll see how positive it will work and I think that we can all reject something that is so exciting," said the idealology.
Doctors claim that the death of sugar whites without the need - the use of sardines can be caused by termination, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
It is therefore worth trying to use it as little as possible, so that this product is added to many food products, even to the oven.
Another "Lietkabelio" step: Lipköviškolina other LKL team
The team of the "Lietkabelio" team welcomed Vytenius Lipkevićim - the branches are being trained by the Prien's "Skycop" team.
In this season, "Betsafe-LKL" V.Lipkevićus has taken 6.4 points, recovered 2.8 coins, delivered 2 results and collected 8.5 useful bags.
In the 29-year-old FIBA Championships, 198 cm of old athletes achieved 3.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, 1.5 resulting transfers and 4.8 useful ball within 21 minutes of the game.
At the latest, Lietkabelis will announce a new buyer that will strengthen the composition.
S. Buškevicas joined the train station
The team of the "Lietkabelio" team became the assistant of the leading coach Nenado Čanako, well known to Lithuanians as Sandis Buškevicas.
The 41-year-old Latvian team played Vilnius "Lietuvovas morning" in 2005-2006 and worked on this club system as a male trainer.
In the past season, S. Buškevics trained Jäkabpils' team "Jekabpils".
The sports director, Jonas Vainauskas, invited Stepon Babrausk to the station, but he is still trying to continue the career of the curator.
The invitation was also granted by Vyten Jasivevic, but the agreement was not reached by both sides.
S. Buškevica "Lietkabelio" coach station will work with Robert Kuncaichi and Algimanta Bruž.
Latvis will join "Lietkabelio" on Tuesday and will be in the "Cido" arena via FIBA Campion's level scale with Dijon JDA, but we will not be able to grow on the ground, as the registration will be completed for 24 hours before the start of the race.
The reduction in the prices of biofuels will not be acceptable for all
In order to reduce biofuel prices, in 2019 more leafed trees will be sold in Lithuania, says the Minister for Environment.
According to Kęstucci Navicko, this is what they want to do with the prices of biofuels.
"We've got a big deal of some kind.
It is necessary to balance (...).
The concentration on the top pages is, as we can also have some effect on the price of biofuels," said Mr. Navick on the second day of September, providing the situation for forest destruction.
According to Navicko, this year the price of wood in Lithuania rose by around 20%.
According to the Minister, in the next year, half will be cut off as much, and this year, and the needles will be less than 50 acres [80 ha].
On the other hand, in Lithuania, wood is produced more because of favourable natural conditions.
"It shouldn't be another year," said Mr. Navick.
Now 10,2 million ha forests are state and 800 thousand ha - private.
Fight with food prices - no doubt obligation: motivates to buy only your area
The offer to reduce the prices of the measures submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture to state agencies and organisations for 50 per cent of the purchase of food from local producers shall be published by the news portal 15min.lt.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office goods could also be offered to the purchaser in the municipality and to local companies that have won the competition," Minister of Agriculture Virginia Sinkević said to the portal.
The president of the meat processing association, Egidijus Mockević, has no doubt that this provision would discriminate against the proportion of businessmen, and it would also be difficult to control whether the law is not used by the sellers.
The measure is also criticised by the Head of the Business Confederation, Mr Sutkus.
Macronas calls for Europe to protect from Russia and the United States
French President Emmanuel Macronas asked on Tuesday to create a "real European military", which had the opportunity to defend Russia and even the United States
E. Macronas, calling for the creation of the European Union's common forces from its own return to power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on the military power of the Americas.
He has recently received an important argument that the US President, Donaldu Trumpou, will announce that Washington will withdraw from the important Treaty on the Nuclear Powers of the Cold War.
"We have to get away from China, Russia and even the United States," E. Macronas said to the radio "Europe".
This is the first interview given to his radio since the beginning of May 2017 at the post of the Chairman.
"When I see how President Trumpas announces that he is fleeing from an important anti-corruption treaty created after the 9th anniversary of a crisis of rockets in Europe, what will be the main sacrifice? - Europe and its security," said the French leader.
This rocket crisis has led to the development of the non-strategic nuclear-weapon-free aircraft that was launched by the United States in Europe by ballistic missiles at the end of the Cold War.
This crisis was a key factor in encouraging the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude the Central Remote Nuclear Powers Treaty (INF) in 1987.
"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a true European military," said Mr. Macronas, in the interview we wrote on Friday evening in Verdene, northeastern France, to the President this week on the occasion of our first world war in the past 100 years before the end of this conflict.
According to E. Macrono, in the context of the situation, "when Russia, who is at our borders, showed that it could be dangerous... we need a Europe that is better suited to itself and not just dependent on the United States."
The French leadership has become a major initiative to create a project for nine European countries which can quickly organize a common military operation, evacuate from the war zone, or provide assistance in the event of civil disaster.
The Minister of Defence of these nine states will meet on the third day for the first time in Paris to discuss details as to how this power will act.
The European Union has also called for a significant increase in its defence budget since 2021 and for research and new technology development of around EUR 13 billion over seven years.
The current EU defence budget does not reach EUR 600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomaras of the French War Schools, who is preparing high-ranking soldiers, said that the vision of the closely united European defence is difficult to implement.
"The idea of creating a common strategy culture is not bad - he told the news agencies AFP.
- However, there is a great gap between the European defence, which Emmanuel Macron's own, and the truth is very much inconsistencies between European partners."
Lukašekka NATO based on rockets: we're not idiots
On Tuesday, President of Belarus, Aleksandra Lukaschenka said that his country would need new weapons if NATO continued to be able to reach the Western Wall of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to be punished, dislocated to a base in Poland or at any rate, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, especially rockets," said A. Lukašenko, a group of American analysts meeting with the United States.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its rocket manufacturing industry.
"In the past - you have observed and we have not hidden - we have created our rocket industry and produced our very precise (used) rocket weapons," the president stressed.
Last week, A. Lukaschenka said that Minska and Moscow were looking for a suitable and impartial response to plans to build a base in Poland and to name it after President Donaldo Trumpo (Donaldo Trampo) for the "Trumpo Fortu" (Fort Trump).
"Of course, this is a matter of concern to us.
If we look at it, they will claim in Poland that it is ready to issue millions of dollars in order to displace some Trumpo fortress, of course, we are not idiots and, of course, are reacting to it," said A. Luschenka, during the main discussion of the Munich security conference in Minsk.
"To be surprised, we will discuss with our main Union (Russia) how to answer all of this and how to find an appropriate response to the minimum costs," he added.
The evening relations with Moscow markedly ended with Russia’s 2014 Kryma anecssion.
They are also known as Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and this year's war in Great Britain, as it is thought that the attempt by the Russian special services to eliminate the former agent from the Serbian script of the nerves.
The tension between Moscow and Washington is further intensified when Dr. Trumpu announced that he plans to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the Control of Nuclear Weapons.
Russia has warned that this step can undermine the global security system.

"I'm going to sleep here.
There are many women living in different rooms.

Alabamos Horts cannot use suspension
Following this six-day period, the appellant of Alabama, Jalena Hurts, will not be suspended for this season.
Hurts is included in the sixth-day prize of the "Crimson Tide" with the highest rank before the weaker Luizian team, and this is the fifth player's prize for this season.
This year the NCAA has adopted a new rule: it is possible to suspend the player involved in the four rounds.
This month "Athletic" reported that Horts planned to do this because of the opponents who won the awards and the team coach's staff responded to them.
Tua's Tagovalia's season was changed by Hurts, but coach Nickas Sabanas told him to use Hurtso's skills.

Owens: Dezas must sign the contract immediately
The former Dallas "Cowboys" team, Dezas Bryant, soon returned to the NFL.
A member of the Slavic Museum told Terrell Owens that it would be better for Bryant.
In response to a question posed by Twitter, when it was intended to sign a contract with the team, Brittany announced on Friday a word known as "Twitter".
Three times selected to Pro Bowl, the Britans are no longer dependent on any team since in the middle of April, Dalas' "Cowboys" rejected the cause of the fighting for compensation.
Bryant, who was able to cancel the contract with the Baltimore Ravens and who was always connected to Cleveland Browns, said before the season that he wanted to change before signing the contract with the team.
In June, when Owens, still talking about returning to the NFL, the website TMZ said the Britans should try to get back to sport as soon as possible.
"They must join the team and prove everything they can," said Owens website.
“All observers believe that he is not upset, and he is not as good as he thinks.
Now he has to go to the team for any remuneration, accept a contract for one or two years – that is totally irrelevant – and show everyone what he can do.”
In the Dalaso command in 2017, Brittany gained a lead 69 times, lost 838 yards and six times won points.
In 29 years, the player has lost 100 yards in his career – 23 yards.
After signing a $70 million contract for five years in 2015, Britain did not lose one season of 1,000 yards and did not gain more than eight points of profit.
"If the Director-General or Owner thinks your skills are wasted, you can't save or collect the amounts you want," Owens advised.
He also warned that Brittany had to get into the team as soon as possible, because later on, it may not have arrived in general and claimed that it would be possible to return to the hard-lived Cowboys.
"Of course, I don't know if their relationships are not satisfied," said Owens, who won 38 times the score of three seasons in the Dallas team.
"I believe that in Dezo, if "Cowboys" takes him back and he gets a chance, it will be useful for Dezu and French."
Council on the establishment of the CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania
In the past week, representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CEERN, European Organization for Nuclear Research) of the European Atomic Energy Agency will assess the possibility of setting up a CERN business development centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe where companies receive help to commercialise CERN technologies, create innovative products and meet the needs of the public.
Although Lithuania has only recently become a member of the CERN, the establishment of a business incubator in the country has already been discussed.
The CERN representatives of Kauna visited the Lithuanian University of Health (LSMU) and the Kauna University of Technology (KTU) in the "Santakos" branch of the Institute of Materials and Biomedical Engineering.
At the meeting at the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC), guests at KTU, LSMU, the University of Vyutato, the Lithuanian Institute of Energy, the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Agriculture and Business discussed the Kauna innovation ecosystem and the opportunities for innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on regional scientists and business innovations.
"This incubator would encourage the adaptation of CERN knowledge and technology to key issues, such as new technology and working intelligence, to use disease diagnostics and treatment, the processing of large data," said Dr. Leonas Balashević, CTU Research and Innovation.
CERN incubators, as well as other young business development centres, provide support for business development - provide information and advice to experts through technology in the production of products and assist in the search for funding sources.
The only difference is that the CERN incubator is more science.
This centre includes experts in various fields: information technologies, materials engineering and medical specialists.
The CERN organisation is best known for the speed of major harron resistance flows in Switzerland (LHC, The Large Hadron Collider), the world's largest and most powerful components.
However, CERN is carried out not only by quantitative mechanisms, but also by other areas, from chryogenic (very high-temperature agents) to partial monitoring and radiation studies.
The work carried out by these technologies and scientists has an impact on many important areas of society: medicine, safety and industrial development.

STT maintained R. Ača - Business information
The former Parliamentary and former Director of the municipality of the municipality of Remigius Ačas is accused of smoking.
He's in custody.
The Special Research Service (STT) reports that the Czech Government officials are conducting a preliminary investigation on possible corruption carried out in the municipality of Rases.
"The former director of the municipality of the municipality of Rásesios R. A. (Remigius Ačas - rst.) is accused of smoking.

R.A. is expected to have received a high value (more than 250 MGL)” says the STT report.
The BNS adds that this company is a Russian bus park.
On the first day, officials also suffered corruption, which was suspected by Vladislova Šimait, head of the Russian-owned bus park.
This was confirmed by the BNS by the STT representative of the Renate Unit.
The STT report also stated that the allegations were also made by two representatives of the companies who directly purchased Mr. Aca or participated in the massacres of six different financial operations.
All suspects are detained, at their workplaces and at home.
Suspension of LSDD
After Remigio Ajas, who had been the director of the municipality of the municipality of Rases, but did not receive his report, he failed to perform these duties.
He was also elected in 2011-2012 by Mr Ačas, a longtime member of the Seima, and has been elected to Parliament since 2004, as a candidate for the Party's Party "Tvarka and Justice".
However, in 2013, he and this party were separated, and in the 2016 Seima elections, he was unable to obtain a mandate on his own.
Now, p. Ahás belongs to the social democracys, and the new-found party of the Social Democrats of Lithuania (LSDD) led by Gedemino Kirkilo.
Shortly after this announcement, the President of the LSDD, Kirkalas, informed the press that Mr. Time had temporarily suspended membership in the party until the investigation was carried out.
"The actions of the Special Research Service and the allegations of Remigius we have been denied, but in all cases, it is necessary to take all necessary action to clarify the truth.
R. Time has temporarily stopped membership in the party until a judicial investigation is carried out," says the LSDD leader Church.
In 2003, Ačas was the leader of the Council's group of Councils, which was later removed from office during the siege of Roland Paxo, who was later removed from office in the case of national security.
Meras A. Gricius: I did not directly control R. Ačo's work
Neither the head of the municipal administration of the region of the Rasenios district, Algirdas Griius, nor the current head of the municipality, Liudas Kavalauskas BNS said on Monday that there was no information that could be relevant to the specific purchase of a legal case.
Meras Gricius said about the arrest of Mr Ačo, who was informed by the media.
"I can't say exactly, we were very affected by the functions that I as a man did my job, he (R. Ačas - BNS) - the administrative work, and I couldn't say for any reason what the public procurement was done," the BNS said on Monday.
He also argued that for the same reasons he did not want to assess the administration of the former municipality of Ačo.
I was afraid to say something that I could appreciate his work, because I did not directly control the works of his administration, as he presented me for public procurement, because of the competitions, said that such and such public procurements, such competitions, after something in the public area was seen, made contracts, which I already saw as a man.
Therefore, I cannot say how he was leading the administration at the time as its director," said Mr. Griños.
He told himself that he had not broken up in public purchases and had no influence on them.

The Minister of Culture added the team of the councillors of Lianos Foodytės-Johnsson to Dr. Juozapas Blažion.
He is a consultant in the management of archives, libraries, museums and cultures.
The Ministry of Culture reports that the scientific degree of menotyr's scientific approach in the University of Vilnius's Department of Science was a professor of literature and art at the University of Vilnius Museum of Music from 2016 until now.
At the end of 2017, the VU Communication College students selected Ms. Blaziun as the best teacher at the university.
The new Minister's council is the author of many scientific articles on cultural heritage and values conservation.
For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:
VZ recalls that, in May of this year, the Minister of Culture, Dr. Victor Bachmetjevas, who consulted the Minister for Public Information Policy, was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renalda Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the Deputy Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for the heritage of culture, archives, museums, and libraries.
At that time, Mr. Rookytė-Jonsson said that her new Deputy Minister was elected in the same area as Mr. Augustinavičius.
At present, along with Mr. Augustinavit's establishment in the permanent area of Mr. Blažion, the Prime Minister's team consists of Rita Grumudaitė, Evalda Stankevicius, Egidijus Galijus, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and Prime Minister Eglė Saudargaitė.
S. Gentvila: EUR 90 million fines due to an ineffective GPAIS business
Simon Gentvila, Vice-President of the Committee on the Environment, said that, as a result of an empty product, packaging and waste accounting system (GPAIS) of Lithuanian producers and importers, almost EUR 90 million could be charged at the end of the year.
"After the end of the year and the GPAIS system has not begun to function normally, the systemic package management sector crisis becomes a more real scenario.
It is not official to say that only 1% of the proposed processing tasks have been issued for signs confirming the disposal of packaging waste," said Mr Gentville in his report.
On 7 November the Seimūnas shall initiate an informal meeting of the Environmental Protection Committee, which aims to discuss the situation, to explain why it does not work on this programme, for which reasons there is no actual implementation of the programme module and how the Ministry of the Environment intends to solve the problem.
"In the absence of the necessary legislative or legislative change initiatives, manufacturers and importers are at risk and are at risk of receiving more extensive environmental pollution taxes by the end of this year," said Mr Gentville.
In his opinion, the lack of the GPAIS accounting system and failure signalled a serious crisis in the waste management sector that could be compared to the Metrail crisis.
Do not worry about the tasks
Some companies may not be affected by the task of re-processing of wastes by the state in 2018 and by some experts.
In the wake of the developments in the first half of the package processing indicators of organisations, experts confirm the underlying reason that some organisations may not be able to deal with the quantity of packaging waste required for 2018.
As a result, some companies may not be able to make use of the cash tax in an eased manner and would be able to pay the cash tax for a certain amount of their sales to the market during the year.
The GO stated that two of the three producer organisations currently operating refused such distortions, and one does not provide any comments.
Mr Pocius, the Director-General of the Green Point of the biggest organisation of the Green Point, said that at least the formality of the success of the task depends on whether the problems of the product, packaging and waste accounting system (GPAIS) will be solved.
"The worst point" plans to achieve this year the task of handling all types of packaging except glass.
Although the task of the glass for the Green Point will not succeed this year, the organisation is demanding compensation for the losses resulting from it.
Experts doubt the benefits of food coupons
The government plans to share coupons in food products and thus promote family or farmers’ trade in less-favoured people, while experts doubt the benefits of such innovation.
They agree that the new system will create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Mr. Marius Dubnikovas, head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, said that the coupons are viable and the problems are not resolved, and the Government should focus on increasing people's income.
"The system seems to have changed dramatically and is taken from older leaders.
If we want to help the public to acquire something or have greater purchasing power, we must turn all our capacities into how to increase people's income, and people must decide whether to buy in one or the other shop," said BNS.
On the other hand, the government, offering food coupons, would attract less income to the people receiving them.
"It is obvious that the less-income people are involved in helping the victim, who would have been written, and we, this Government, have given you the teacher, and be pleased with us.
This would be like certain anti-selective promises, where they would like to be very clearly signed," the analyst said.
It argues that the food coupon system will require additional investments, and it will also increase its administrative burden, as it will need to take care of whatever it allows to protect them from processing.
The Swedish Bank's chief economist, Nerius Macchiulis, says that with one instrument, the objectives of both - to support low-income residents and small-scale entrepreneurs - will not be achieved.
"If this is the aid to small businessmen, the aid compensation for price differences and residents can buy cheaper goods in smaller shops, it will compensate the price difference from the state's budget.
Then this is supported by business, but not by the residents," said Mr. Machoulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant effect on the macroeconomic impact and, in essence, the competitive situation of small sellers, but, contrary to that, would create an additional bureaucratic burden and could impede the return of new market participants.
"I think it would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with large administrative costs, and it would also be a bit uncomfortable for the people, they should buy not in a larger store with larger adsorptions, but search for a few specialized shops with a lower aorstance," said the economist.
In other countries, coupons are used when the content of goods or services is limited and must be given to all the same or to some social group.
At that time, the people will receive coupons free of charge and may issue them for food.
According to Mr Macchiuli, they are also used in the labour market by providing temporary tax relief to companies, working long-term unemployment, or, for example, former prisons.
This practice, in the words of Machuli, has also been successfully applied in Lithuania.
The Prime Minister Saulus Skvernel said on Monday that the government's consideration of a new food coupon system would help the poorest people to increase competition, encourage small traders or farmers' business.
Prime Minister Skirmantas Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get 20% discount.
According to him, the amount of coupons would be limited so that farmers could not be exploited.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to have EUR 10-15 benefits per month.
It is true that, although funds for the State budget programme have not yet been provided, it could be financed from this source, perhaps also from the European Union funds.
"Not everything that is currently foreseen or not in the budget will end, it will still change the Seima, so it happens, may be transferred from one line to another, and from the ministries, change can be financed in part.
It is always a matter of priority – or something to resolve by creating another additional source of income and similar – –” said Mr Malinauskas on Tuesday.
Before deciding what scope and how long it will be possible to apply the novelty.
