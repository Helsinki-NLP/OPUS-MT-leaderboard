The members of the Wales International Assembly are afraid that they will look like the Muppets.
The members of the International Assembly have agreed to make their appointment to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament or member of the Wales Parliament).
The theme has started with the plan to change the name of the International Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
All representatives of political movements at the International Assembly are concerned that this may lead to a smiley definition.
One member of the international assembly, including the librarians, said that his group members are worried because it goes against the words “Twp and Pwp”.
To explain to the readers outside Wales: the magical word daf means a knack and pwp means a cup.
A member of the board said that the whole group was “not happy” and has made other names available.
A member of the Wales Conservative Group said that his group was "acceptable", but he noted that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "Muppet".
For explanation: in Kakuri, there is a string w vote similar to the English of Yorkshire.
The Commission of the International Assembly, which is currently drawing up a legislative proposal concerning the change of name, said: "The final decision on all names by which members of the International Assembly are invited shall, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The law of the Wales Government in 2017 gave Wales the right to change its name to the International Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public debate on proposals on behalf of the International Assembly on the basis of which it is widely supported to refer to the Wales Parliament.
In the case of an official office of the members of the International Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Wales Parliament members or the WMPs’, but in the public debate, the participants took part in the option ‘MWP’.
The members of the Assembly are likely to provide other names, but the conclusion of the agreement may be a challenge to President Elin Jones, who should present amendments to the legislative proposal in the near future.
The reform legislation also includes other amendments to the principles of work of the International Assembly, including the rules for the adoption of the rights of the members of the International Assembly and the establishment of the Committee's system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the International Assembly will remain before them in the discussion of the Act.
Macedonians are organizing a change in the name of the State of the People's Republic
On Sunday, the voters voted in favour of calling their country "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum will be organised with the aim of resolving a lasting ten-year dispute with Greece, which has its province of Macedonia.
Athens has already claimed that its name is on the basis of a claim for this territory and has repeatedly submitted objections to the candidateship of the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia, who is opposed to the vote on behalf of the change, has said that he intends to abstain from the vote.
The parties to the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, however, argue that the change is only the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Towers Are Disturbing, for Harlem’s Churches are in dire straits
"More people I've talked to have said that in the past there was one bar and one church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no more."
He said that missing the bars is understandable.
"People deal differently today," he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhoods where people come every day."
However, regarding the church, he argues that the money available from the sale of goods will not continue as long as the leaders expect, and “more or later they are back at the beginning. ”
Adams added that the churches can be replaced with the homes of the Cardipelago people who do not extend help to the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of those who buy the streets in these buildings are white," he added, "which therefore speed up the arrival of that day when all these churches shut their doors, because it is unlikely that most of the people living here will become members of their churches."
Both churches built white congregations prior to Harlem’s arrival at the Black Sea Metro - Metropolitan Community in 1870, the Church of Saint Martin was built ten years later.
The original white method congregation disappeared in the 1930 ’ s.
The congregation of the Black Seas, who had already worshiped the gods, took over the property of the house.
John Howard Johnson, who led the Catholic Church in front of the Afro - American Congregation of the Holy Martin Church, also led a campaign against the 125th Street runners who refused to pay or promote black people.
In 1939, the damage was made to the building, but when Father Johnson’s congregation members planned to rebuild the building, they took possession of a carillion, or gambling.
Father Johnson’s son and agent of St. Martin’s church, Reverence David Johnson called the career “the sword of the enemy. ”
In July, the characters played by the Julian Karion gave it another name: "Cultural value" and "non-replaced historical instrument".
Also, President Tiffany Ng Michigan noted that it is the world's first career, which played a black-and-white music, Dionisio A. Lind, who continued 18 years ago to play the largest career in the Riverside church.
Mr. Meriweather said the Church of Saint Martin didn't replace him.
The Church of Saint Martin has been a history of architects and employers, some of whom have joined church leaders, other holiday groups.
In the preamble of the book, perhaps the governing body of the congregation, who was not independent of the governing body, wrote to the fishing team that the fishing team “does not seek to increase its costs,” even though it was not even involved in the payment of the architects and employees sent to the fishing area.
Some of the members of the Joint Committee cut off the transparency of fishing activities.
California attacked a 13-year-old boy who was born after a 13-year-old.
According to the authorities, he was attacked and injured by a 13-year-old boy who was killed in California on the opening day of the home.
The attack took place immediately before the seven mornings of Beacon's Beachi near Encinita.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that it was about half an hour late in the morning with friends, when he heard the boy kisses and then went to another place to help the boy get out of the water.
In the words of Hamel, he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for getting home early, but “he realized that the boy’s anger was ‘ What a shame!
I've been shot!"
All his rank was broken," Hammel described in a vision what he saw when he reached the boys.
“I told everyone that they would come out of the water, ‘The water is hot!’” in the accompanying box, Hammel.
A life-threatening situation led to a flight of Rady to the children's hospital in San Diego.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
The president and Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that they had been marked a few weeks earlier in the region, but then it was found that doing so was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were sitting on top of the train.
The authorities closed access to the investigation and safety objectives for 48 hours to the ponto Beach in Ecinita, from Casablada to Swamin.
Giles added that there are more than 135 accidents in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to take power on the United Kingdom's ill-treatment market
Sainsbury takes over the chains of Bootsi, Superdrug and Debenhams, creating the interfaces of supermarketed beautiful products, where researchers also work.
As part of an important increase in the United Kingdom’s 2.7 billion-dollar luxury market, which continues to increase in the sales of moose and household goods, large quantities of luxury products will be tested throughout the country by 11 people, taking them to the next year’s use in other fields as well.
Illuminated products are invested because the supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space allocated for the previous circuits, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said that it plans to double the choice of its luxury products to 3000 products, including for the first time also trade marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
The existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Beisel are also given more space in brandy areas, as is currently found in the Boots.
The supermarket also brings back to the market a series of its dairy products Boutique, where most of the products are suitable for vegetables, as young buyers always demand more.
In addition, the perfume seller, Fragrance Shop, has been tested by two Sainsbury guys who first opened last week in Croydon, South London and the other is opened this year in Selly Oaks, Birmingham.
The purchase and transfer of the website for the daily purchase of small quantities of food from local food sources means that supermarkets must try more to encourage people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury, has said that sales sites are starting to be more like supermarkets because the supermarket chain is trying to fight oil chains such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argos's sales sites in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habits's sales sites, since Sainsbury bought both keys two years ago, which has been alleged to have supported food sales and changed the acquisitions more profitable.
An earlier attempt by the Supermarket to renew its components of luxury and medicinal products ended with failure.
Sainsbury tried to join Booth in the early 2000s, but it ended up quite a bit over how to share the proceeds from the sale of patent goods in its supermarkets.
A new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold his 281-year-old drug for 125 million pounds for Celesio, which belongs to the entire Lloyds Pharmacy marketing chain.
The strategy also plays its role in adding its four points to the product selection of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Said Paul Mills-Hicks of Sainsbury: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beautiful products to fill the environment around us for customers.
We have also spent money on employees who are always ready to recommend.
Our trade mark meets every need, but the surrounding environment and pleasant places mean that we are now a competitive destination of luxury trade, which can change the way old buying is done."
Peter Jones is maruvihane, because Holly Willoughby released 11 million of the language deal.
Dragons Deni star Peter Jones left "survival", when the TV director Holly Willoughby released 11 million gleams of the transaction in his life-sale brand in order to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby's coming home for Truly's time.
A couple of companies are compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old television director "This Morning" announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Deni star Peter Jones angry, standing out of their luxurious lifestyle brand for the last minute to focus on their new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said that Jones was a "marvene" when a television screen girl announced at a closed meeting, which took place on Tuesday at Marlows Buckinghamshire headquarters, that his new contracts in the value of 1.5 million pounds meant that she no longer had enough time to devote to the trademark of domestic goods and clothing to Truly.
The husband is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark Goop and was thought to double-order Willoughby's estimated 11 million-dollar stock.
When 37-year-old Willoughby informed Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his vacations.
One source says: “Truly was certainly the first prize that Holly won.
This had to ensure his distant future, so the woman considered herself to be doing it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave everything was completely out of control.
No one could believe it on the second day because it was so close to the product chain on the market.
The Marlow headquarters has a table, which is full of sales goods."
Experts believe that the release of one of the most cost-effective silences in the United Kingdom can be paid to businesses, since the choice of products ranging from divinists and from cynics and cyclists to domestics has been invested in a total of money. It can also include later marketing of the product.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
Three children's mother Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for nearly ten years.
Willoughby struck Truly with Cappi in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the trade mark in March.
The couple are on vacation, and Jones has 40% of the largest share in the Baldwin teleproducion companies.
Willoughbys will become M&S brandy and will exchange Ant McPartlin's I'm A Celebrity TV.
One of Jones’ close sources said last night: “I don’t want to comment on his business. ”
The Challenge of Being “For What We Love ”
Trump laughed at the criticism, which had been addressed in the news on his commentary, which some should be "valued to the president", and too positive to the North Korean Head of State.
Why is President Trump so late?
Trump said in his own "Newstations" voice:
"I haven't done anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the liberation of North Korea's nuclear warheads.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have ceased.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders in the United Nations, on a Saturday, that North Korea does not see the US "responsive reaction" to the early disarmament events in North Korea.
He also noted that the United States will continue to be subject to oppressive restrictions.
It was a much more exciting view of the cramps.
"We're going to North Korea very well," he said.
"The first war with North Korea was.
Millions of people would have died.
Now it's all right between us."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have led to good results: implementation has been completed, has been helped to free the hostage and has been organized to bring American servants to their homes.
He also protected his improper relationship with Kim.
"The presidential presence is very easy, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait for access to this completed stadium, it is better that we have about 200 people here," said Trump, pointing forward to the crowd.
Tsunami and the landscape destroy Indonesian islands, killing hundreds of people
In eliminating the effects of the effects of the earthquake in Lomboki, foreign government organizations were told that they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lomboki’s population had to be relocated, it was not declared a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international assistance, so that the creatures are a little complex," said Mr. Sumbung.
At the same time as the Save the Children organization, together with a team that is approaching Palus, it is still not clear whether foreign countries can work in the region.
The President of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palus, deciding whether international authorities are allowed to help with the enlargement.
In view of the fact that the Indians are often land-colored, the country has been extremely little prepared to deal with natural gas.
Although the site has been built in Aceh for tsunamis, they have not been particularly widespread in other coastal areas.
Although Tsunami was maintained, there was an increase in the apparent absence of Tsunami treatment siren, which was likely due to the number of seizures.
Traveling between Indonesia's digital islands is also a relatively challenging challenge in the best time.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
In Lomboki, a sick man who is stopped to treat the victims of the earthquake moves to Palus, but he spends at least three days to reach a new location.
President Joko Widodo has transformed Indonesia into a central part of its selection campaign, and he has allocated money to roads and railways.
The budget deficits, however, threaten Mr Joko's Government, as new elections will take place next year.
In Indonesia, too, Mr Jokot is concerned about the migrations in which the members of the majority of the Muslim community have turned to the old-fashioned form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were left behind because of the conflicts between Christian and Muslim communities today, where massages, viruses, and alcohol were used, as well as other original weapons.
Look: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge is playing a five-coloured game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge escaped the loss of Liverpool in Chelsea Premier League, leaving his position at the 89th minute of the game in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was fed by Jerdan Shaqiril, having a colourful Chelsea about 27 meters away when her team was running 1 : 0.
He threw himself on the left, before he threw it on the far end of the post.
The ball flew high above the scene and caught the network's best way.
It's down to the fucking Kepa Arrizaball, and it hits the network.
"I was just trying to get a seat like that, get to the ball, and players like Shaq give the ball as much as possible, so I just tried to win for me as much time as possible," Sturridge said on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, I made a mistake, and I gave him a little bit of a lie."
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1 : 0 thanks to the 25th minute of the game, Belgium's star, Ed Hazard's stolen paint.
The Blues attacker played this game back to Mateo Kovacic, before he turned around in the middle of the day and ate half of Liverpool.
Kovacic gave the average fast food.
Then he poured out a great sigh of relief, leading to Hazard’s death.
Hazard got through the protection and threw a ball on the back of Liverpool player Alison Becker from a remote post across the network.
Liverpool plays in Naples Masters' Cup three days ago at 15.00 Stadium San Paolo Naples in Italy.
Chelsea is playing with Videoton with UEFA Euroli on Thursday at 15.00 in London.

The image of Parliament Cromwell is the last reminder that is the reason for the "resignation of history" table
The removal would be a religious justification for the destruction of so many of the cultural and religious elements of England in the Taliban style of the man's extraordinary defenders.
But Cromwell's association described Mr Crick's recommendation as a rewriting of the mind and the history of history.
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Association, said: “The debate on the elimination of images was impossible for Oliver Cromwell Westminster to be left out of memory.
Cromwell didn't steal pictures in the English Home War himself, nor did he tell others to do so.
Perhaps the false Cromwell man was victimized for the past century's acts of Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent Cromwell's presentation is proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the historical record of this person who should continue to express respect in the minds of many people."
Mr. Goldsmith told the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people felt more at the end of the 19th century than in today’s Cromwell Parliament’s protection and, of course, for the sake of royal power.
Whether to do so is an exact opposite, there is an endless historical conflict.
It is certain that by the middle of the 17th century, the pillar has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell is clearly representing this section on one side.
His achievements as the Lord's Protector also merit recognition and remembrance."
Killed dead with a killer in China's grave
According to local media reports, Edela-China was attacked on the market by relatives who killed a man.
A man who only met with our family Yuan was found dead and blood-protected by the wounded arthropod near Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported the newspaper “Morning Post” on Sunday in South China.
The expert prepared on 30 May 2005 in Xiningis Qinghai province of China has been in the habit of vaccination.
It is unlikely that on three days he had come from a nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 cigarettes on the market.
The next morning, the man found out that he was dead and discovered that this strange foundation had been opened.
He said that the situation was caused by a great blood flow.
The trial confirmed that 249,47 pounds per kilogram was due to a sudden death according to the report.
"My legs were bloodied and broken," said the newspaper "Guyang Evening News" by the victim Wu's voice.
The security cameras showed Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:40 a.m. to eat his milk.
He was found about an hour later.
The dead man did not belong to Yuan or to his uncle.
The marketing director told Evening News that he wanted to read it so that he could not be attacked by anyone else until the evidence was collected at the police station.
The Greek family and the market leaders are likely to discuss the payment of compensation for the death of a man.
Although rare, though, it has been observed that they attack people.
In 2016 he attacked his wife and his wife at their Massachusetts farm. The man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a total of 294,83 pounds [294,83 kg] of salt was struck on the side of the whaling tractor until the man’s wife was afraid of leaving the animal.
When a member of the Oregon Council took his own seats in 2012, one of Manitoba's fans told CBC News that they were not normally attacked, but because of the taste of blood, they could go away.
“They’re just fun.
They're very curious maracrats who don't want to hurt.
It's just a story to keep," said the man.
Orcaan Rosa’s findings produce huge ice creams in the rest of the United States
According to the forecasts, it weakens the coast of Rosa, moving over the coastal waters of Mexico.
In addition, in recent days, Rosa brings colds to North Mexico and the United States.
On Sunday morning at 05:00 a.m., Rosa was assigned to the first category of Orcaanian wind - talking hour in the morning, located 619.59 miles [619.59 km] along the route of Punta Eugenia from Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the lowland region moves to the west of the United States. When Rosa approaches the tropical storm on the first day on the Bay of California, it starts to turn deep into the deep tropical drought on the other side of the USA.
On the first day, Rosa comes to Mexico, where she gets up to 25,4 inches [5,4 cm] of cold.
Then there will be a tropical tropical climate that will respond to the coming low power. In the next part of the country, there will be massive strong winds of colds.
At the same time, it causes the wind to rise from 2,54 to 10,16 centimetres in the direction of dangerous evaporators, evaporators, and possible landfills.
The severe tropical drought causes an increase of between five and five and a half inches [7 and 6 cm] in an hour, particularly in the south-east of Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected that 5,08 to 10,16 centimetres will be raised in certain regions of the USA, particularly Arizona.
Excavations are possible due to the rapid deterioration of tropical rain conditions.
Certainly, in case of a threat of tropical flux, it should not be moved to the top of the foot.
Strong winds may cause the cannon to change into fast-moving winds and ice-creams, accompanied by windscreens and flying waves.
The coming low power will bring to its place the hot summers in the southern California coastal areas.
It is possible that the total content of the seeds is greater than 1,27 centimetres and may cause smaller droplets and libes.
This would be the first drought in the region during the winter period.
Troopy tropical winds begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evenings and on Monday mornings, the winds become huge on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Strong winds reach Four Corners on Tuesday and stay until three days.
In October, large temperatures are predicted in the United States due to the fall in Arctic, while the tropical areas remain still high.
Sometimes it brings great temperatures in small areas.
In the United States of America, the sun’s light reflects an excellent example of significant temperature changes.
The temperature ranges between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebrasca) as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) extend to 20 degrees.
In the next few days, he tries to reassess his long fishing trip.
Most of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to wait for a substantial increase in the temperature of 80 soybeans in early October from the south to the west.
New York is expected on Tuesday to be 26.6 soybeans, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the United States of America, the first half of October is the likelihood of high average temperatures.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was looking at over 20 million people
More than 20 million people were watching a four-day television interview by the candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and he was alleged to have been convicted in the 1980s by a woman named Christine Blasey Fordi.
At the same time, the political turmoil in which the ringleading organisations ceased to reflect the series of regular broadcasts for the last minute: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake concluded an agreement with the FBI to organize a joint investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Legal Commission that he was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had robbed him of his hair and tried to remove women's clothes at the end of high school.
Kavanaugh told his church in his statement that he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
According to the Nielsen report, there were probably more than 20.4 million people on the streets.
The company calculated the average level of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC TV.
Numbers were not immediately available for other channels showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also often having problems with counting among those who are looking at transfers from the authorities.
In comparison, it can be said that it is about the same size as in football games or in the sharing of Oscares.
Fox News Channel, which has been strongly supported by the appointment of Kavanaugh's office, led all the network to a total of 5.69 million viewers throughout the whole day, Nielsen said.
ABC 3.26 million viewers remained elsewhere.
CBS had 3.1 million, 2.14 million NBC, 2.89 million MSNBC and 2,52 million viewers to CNN, Nielsen said.
The interest was great after the trial too.
Flake was the middle actor of the series.
After a statement by Kavanaugh was made by the measuring office, the CNN and CBS cameras met in the morning when he was attacked by the thinkers in the army, trying to go with the elevator justice committee.
He stood up for a few minutes in the country when he was convicted and put in the CNN.
"I'm standing here, before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He said: “My power is being made perfect in weakness, at the same time as so many women have. ”
Flake said that his department issued a statement and added before the elevator closed, that he had more to say at the Commission's session.
A number of hours after the vote by the Legal Committee, the cable and round-the-clock voice networks included direct audiences in order to send a vote to the Kavanaugh office to continue voting at the plenary session.
But Flake said that he only did this in the sense that the FBI is investigating the charges against the candidate the following week, which have been demanded by the democracies in the minority.
Flake participated in a conversation with Senator Chris Coon, a friend of the Democratic Party.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s decision had an effect because it was apparent that the Liberals could not vote in Kavanaugh without the consent of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI statement on Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit's critics in political play

The pressure continues to rise in an area that supports independence even a year later, when Madrid declared it illegal on 1 October, but what the Catalysts pointed out, however, was split.
The voters decided to make an excessive decision for independence, even though the electoral activity was low, because the vote was very much different from the vote against the issue.
In the words of the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to block the vote in favour of all the voting groups in the region, including violent co-compressants.
The parties to self-determination were on the road for the voting groups at night to avoid any entertainment offered by the national police.
The media, however, did, but they had to take another path.
Narciss Termes, 68-year-old electrician, who participated in an opinion sharing the separation with his wife, said that he no longer looked forward to seeing the Catalans as his own.
"Last year, one of our best moments of life was found.
I saw how my parents lifted the joy of the opportunity to vote, but now we are in the mood," he said.
Despite the important, but the regional elections held in December last year in the last year have found it difficult to keep a record this year in the fields that support the independence of the Catalan people, since some of the leaders who knew have gone into exile themselves or have been hiding and are awaiting trial for their part in the organisation of the referendum and in the exercise of their independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who keeps a statement on his cell phone to support the police, said that both sides of the table were again aired by politicians.
"The situation is getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine members of the Catalians, who has been in the EBRD since last year, announced that he will participate in the European Parliament's elections next year.
"The candidateing of the European Parliament's elections is the best way to understand the legality of the restoration of democratic values and the supervisory authorities of the Government of Spain," he said.
Londonderry: a man arrested because the car framed the house
Three men were arrested at the age of 33, 34 and 39 after their cars repeatedly crossed the house in Londonderry.
The event found the location of Ballynagard Crescentis on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. place according to British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the paintters and the building.
He was also able to get a vibulin for a while in the car.
I'm going to beat Livingston to win 1 to 0 in front of Rangers.
Dolly I'm the first thief to win for Livingstone.
According to Livingston's opening of Rangers, Steven Gerrard took a second lose during the 18th game, when the man was the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Wega's shooting the agency to determine if Gary Holt raised a level with a second of hibernation.
Gerrrard will remain in the first row on this occasion and will be confronted on the following Sunday with the leaders of Hearts, who will be on the ground with eight points.
Before that, the Rangers Rapid Vienna will be held in the euro area on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston extended his infamous attack to seven games, while the Captain Holt still had an hour of loss since Kenny Miller's release last month.
Livingston loses a chance against the visitors of the niggers
The team should always have been running a fire before the explosion, since their direct games caused any problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts broke out in front of the color, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to capture Craig Halkett's head of the color.
Ridiculers made it easy for Rangers to play in front of themselves, knowing that they could cause problems to visitors.
And it's also a way to figure out how to break the rules.
The Rangers created a free market, and Livingston had an opportunity to play the scheme of Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took a ball and made it a success in the war.
At that time, the Rangers were mainly in a palace, but they could not survive the protection, so the locker Liam Kelly was most comfortable on the side of the property.
The same pattern continued on the other side, although Alfredo Morelos once tried to protect Kelly.
Allan McGregor, the Ranger of Rangers, defeated Scott Pittman and Lithgow was originally involved in the next team in Livingstone.
The thieves came to Livingstone's prison and went there regularly. Two prisoners were also ordered to leave, one of them, to replace Halket Glenn Middleton and the other to wash his hands.
Fenominal achievement from Livingstone – analysis
BBC Shotimaa Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni station
Fenominal drying and resulting from Livingstone.
Each player was great, passing the order over completely waiting.
Their games and players have changed greatly since the fast pace of recovery, but Holt has to express respect for how he has been hurt since his arrival.
He had so much of your legs.
Captain Halket was impressed by the well-organized protection, while Mega maintained Connor Goldson and Joe Worralt all over the game.
But the Rangersite showed up.
Despite their well-being under the leadership of Gerard, these examples were less than that.
Their last roll is missing: access to the home area was only a process that could work in the center of the table as a shock to the Rangers.
Erdogan’s Controversial Reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) there were both laughs and concerns, as did the leaders of Turkey and Germany at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been left behind on issues relating to human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new high-level museum.
The city has the largest community of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police referred to security, prohibiting the assembly of 25,000 members, but a number of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of people against Erdogan have expressed their opinion that a large part of them have also made their voice heard, explaining the verdict of both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to ban the President of Turkey in his country.
The possible comments show that the situation in the neighborhood has deteriorated: some German villagers greet him as a dog, while others treat him as a tyrant.
Traffic accident in Deptford Road: road traffic empty with a car crash
In London, there was a car crash on the ground floor.
The event took place near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on the fast road near Deptford, about 10:15 from the British winter.

At the point of birth, traffic is closed and buses are turned around, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Latin Prison: In peace, he got a six-year prison officer
The prison officer reported that six prison officials had been very secure in the peace of a man in a secure prison.
His Majesty Long Lattini's prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 09:30 a place according to the British winter and not yet finished.
A series of silences, which are linked to eight prisons, are involved in the conduct of police officers of the law enforcement authorities.
The prison officials were treated with easier facial expressions at the scene.
The president of the prison department said: “Special training officers have been invited to resolve the pending cases in the HMP Long Latin prison.
Five men received medical assistance because of their injuries.
We don't want any violence in our prisons, they'll be handed over to the police and their imprisonments will be extended."
HMP Long Latins is over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June was informed that the prison director was sent to the hospital after his arrest.
In October last year, however, the law enforcement police were called into custody in order to seek true peace, during which they were attacked by police officers.
Orcaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with explosives (may be useful in the main areas)
The Troopian Low Power does not often find Arizona, but it is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, when a heavy hurricane surges over the United States, with the threat of extinction.
National air services have already been organized on the first and second days of emergency monitoring in the West Arizona, Nevada in the south and east, California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the suggestion, Rosa is heading directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the region on the first day of summer.
Phoenix’s national air - conditioner claims that “from 1950 onwards, only ten tropical cycles have been kept at a distance of 321,86 miles [321,86 km] on the plane of Phoenix’s tropical storm or low power!
Katrina (1967) was an Orcaan who passed 64.37 kilometers across the Arizona border."
The greenest models of the National Orcaanian Centre predict 5.08 to 10.16 centrifuge, which can be extended in areas limited to 15.24 centimetres in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other regions of the United States, including the Mediterranean and the Great Lakes, are likely to be between 2.54 and 5.08 centimetres, extending to 10.16 centimetres in limited areas.
Rosa’s seeds can be a blessing to the coastal areas, as the region is in dire need of water.
Although overcrowdings are very disturbing, such anger is likely to be beneficial, as the reason is the rule of the U.S. government.
According to the U.S. initial monitor, at least 40% of Arizona's gross or, in the case of a second category, reported weather.com.
First of all, Rosa Baja California's half-year-old map is in the country of Mexico.
Rosa, who was still at Orcaan’s largest train station in the morning, is now 619.95 miles [619.95 km] south of Punta Eugenia from Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 km [19.31 km] north.
The torm is linked to the water that flows into the Pacific, and that's why it smells a little.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will arrive in the country of Mexico on the first day after sunset or midnight.
Among the hundreds in certain regions of Mexico, there may be a great risk of significant flooding.
“Baja California to Sonora’s dependability can be expected to increase the anger of the entire population of 7.62 to 15.24 centimetres, extending up to 25.4 centimetres,” said weather.com.
Then Rosa moves over the tropical storm north of Mexico, arriving on the other side of Arizona’s coast on Tuesday morning as a tropical sub-air, which passes over Arizona and reaches Utah’s southern part of the afternoon at the late afternoon.
"The main threat to Rosa or its consequences is very strong hatreds in Baja California, Sonora Hope and the United States on the other side," said the National Orcaanian Centre.
These winds can cause life-threatening and toxic pollutants in the mountains and the soils in the dry areas.

Trump said that Kavanaugh "responsive" the Democratic Party "under the yoke of religion and hatred"
"Judge Kavanaugh's support is voiceless and unacceptable against the tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in his farewell speech to Wheelingus West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "supported" during the process of appointing his office, the Democratic Party "undermining and hate".
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, briefly and emotionally rebuffed Christine Blasey Ford’s charges, which he had been accused of decades ago when they were court-martials.
He also gave a witness to Ford on his charges.
On Saturday, the President said that "the Americas saw that day the light, quality and freshness of Kavanaugh".
Judge Kavanaugh, who was appointed to serve as the office, is voting in favour of appointing one of the most valuable legislative experts in our time, who has no record of public service," he said to the support of the people of West Virginia.
The President immediately referred to the Office of Kavanaugh, at the same time talking about the importance of electoral activity in the country.
“Five weeks have left one of my most important choices in life.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm a candidate," he said.
"That is why I am all about to fight on behalf of the great candidates."
Trump said that democracy is on a mission, which aims to "against and prevent it".
The first main vote on the application of Kavanaugh's application to the Senate was expected to take place at a later date, the leader of the Party of the Republican Party told CNN of the old-fashioned CNN.
Thousands have been killed in Earth and Tsunami in Indonesia, the number of seizures increases
At least 384 people were quiet and many were at peace when the Hiddellians turned to the sea after a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had arrived on the streets together at the beach festival in Palu, where at the time, six-metre south of the coast, killed a lot of people and destroyed everything that remained on the road.
Tsunami was followed by 7.5 magnitudes.
"When a tsunami hit yesterday, people still took their action, not running immediately, leaving such a victim," said BNPB, President Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Jakarta at the press conference.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, but took with him cars, wages and houses, washing all over the land," Nugroho said, adding that Tsunami moved at a speed of 800 km an hour before reaching the shore.
Some people ran to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to Palu 24 centers.
The air photographs published by the Catastrophe showed, among others, destroyed buildings and fields, destroyed and destroyed walls and walls surrounded by water.
The materials on the shoreline also continued on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the region were aware of land-colored crops.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released after a strong earthquake was about 200 times greater than its own nuclear bomb hit by Hiroshimas in World War II.
The city’s geographical location along the long and narrow shore could increase the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damages "as a relief" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have been destroyed together.
He said that some victims' bodies were found buried under the walls of the building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
Nugroho said that the number and damages of the mines could be greater than 300 km north of Palu, on the coast of Dongja, which was close to the center of the continent.
“I am completely in need of and do not contain any information, ” said Nugroho.
"There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the region," said Red Ris in his statement, adding that its crew and volunteers have been able to suffer in places.
"It's already with tragedy that can go even worse," he said.
The authorities were criticised extensively on Saturday because it did not inform the city of Palu, even though the authorities said that the loans arrived at the coast at the same time as the ban was lifted.
The amateurs in the social media have seen a man pass over a building that keeps the people moving slowly below today for the tsunami approaching the tsunami.
A few minutes later, the sailor gets to the beach, carrying him home and cars.
Reuters was not able to confirm the integrity of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive electricity crisis that prevented links in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organize rescue operations.
The army has begun sending transport flights from Jakarta to Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but refugees still need food and other basic work.
The airport in town was opened again for rescue work, leaving another part closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the evacation centres on Sunday.
The number of seizures increased by Indonesian tsunamis over 800.
It's very bad.
Although the World Vision workers arrived safely from Dongāst to Palu, where they were hiding in the presence of their offices, they saw spectacular views on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They said you saw a lot of lost houses," he cried.
It's very bad.
Although the aid provided a strong start to disaster relief activities, it was clear that the workers of large international aid organisations were prevented from travelling to Palus with great experience.
In accordance with the Indonesian rules, funds, supplies and aid may be received from abroad only when the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This continues to be done at the provincial level with disaster," said Aulia Ariani, president of the Red Cross, Indonesia.
"If the government says, "OK, doing is a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but this situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night came after the earthquake and tsunami, people’s friends and families were still full of hope that their loved ones would be these wonderful events that would explain the nature of the natural disasters.
On Saturday, the channel width was raised in a small boy.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had two days under the cover of her mother’s corpse.
On the train of the Indonesian national football team, trainer Gendon Subandon has lost two runners to Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The others who are staying at the Roa Roa Hotel are his students, in addition to Mr. Manji.
"I have a personal burden from the senator," he said.
Mr. Gendon told about how after the release of the new refurbishment of the Roa Roa Hotel, he welcomed whatsAppi's message to Palu's competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked only by a single government bird with two blue birds.
"I think it means that the messages didn't reach the point," he said.
Varga took EUR 23,585,88 at the time of the execution of the banking car at Newport on the Levies's
On Friday morning, the stocks of Newport on the Levees' banker's car were recovered from €23,585.88 from the Brinki worker who completed the Levees' car, published in the press of the Newport police department.
The car manager canceled the bank car and made more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in press release.

Witnesses have seen a number of suspects running from the scene, writing the press, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about the former are requested to contact the Newport police (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper takes his new name Ye
Räppar Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday in Twitter, a man wrote: "Endine Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been invited by Y for a while, and a man has also used his name as the title of the eight album published in June.
The change will take place before her preview is sent by Saturday Night Live, where a man will declare his new album Yandhi in advance.
He replaces a song by singing Ariana Grandet, who removed his concert "for a time of feeling," said the author.
In addition to the fact that doing so is with the shortness of the present man, West has previously said that doing it is of religious importance to him.
"I think "yes" is one of the most common words in the Bible, which means "sin," said West earlier, discussing the name of his album with the radio director Big Boy.
"That's why I'm you, I'm us, they're us.
I changed my name from Kanye, which means "one", the name Ye, which is only a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
Kanye West is not the only one who plays his name.
Sean Combsi is primarily known by the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the music announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
In cooperation with Westi, JAY-Z has also used its name with and without it, great and small.
Mexico's policy AMLO allows us not to use military force against civilians
At the time when the nation is approaching the 50th anniversary of the blood attacks directed against the scientists, Mexico's presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador agreed on Sunday Tlatelolco Plazas that “never use military force to guide mechanical classes”.
The army attacked a peaceful declaration of peace on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people while all of Latin America was under attack to confirm the movements of the left.
Lopez Obrador has agreed to support young people's mechanics, to pay their students any support and to open up more free to the public.
He has said that the lack of employment and educational opportunities can lead to young people's criminal forces.
The United States should double the financing of the technical allowance.
"Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of engineering technology, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this area," said the financer and technologist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after the various parts of the US Government made statements concerning the technical unit, although the US does not have an overall official strategy under the technical unit.
At the same time, in the past year, China has announced its plan to be a manufacturer for the renewal of the technical licence by 2030.
"Technology research budgeting would be a good start, given that other countries are so far away from the United States, and we will act on behalf of the next technical unit," Lee said.
The double funding is twice the probability that the next major technical agency will be achieved in the United States, according to the interview given this week by Lee CNBC.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month, Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the company's Sinovation Ventures, which funded one of the most outstanding technical engineering companies in China Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked with Carnegie Mellon at the University of Technology, which won the best Othello players in the United States. Later, he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the former US government technology competition such as the United States Department of Defence Research Research Research Agency's Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked where the next competition will be to help identify the following dreamers.
"US scientists must work hard to get government funding," said Lee.
"It is not the one who takes over the artists, they are the companies at the top," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired scientists from universities in recent years to work in the field of engineering.
Lee said that the changes in the immigration policy could help the US to support the efforts of the technical unit.
"I think that a doctor's doctor's degree in the field of engineering should automatically offer a red card," said the man.
In July 2017, the Council of the People's Republic of China published the next generation's technical licence development plan.
"The National Research Fund of China shares funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Research Fund and other government agencies allocate money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," said Lee.
At the beginning of that year, the United States Ministry of Defence established a joint technical unit centre aimed at involving partners from both industry and educational institutions, but the White House announced the establishment of a committee chosen by the Technical Service.
That month, DARPA announced that it would fund the AI Next initiative with two million dollars.
However, the National Research Fund is currently funding over $100 million in research related to technical engineering.
At the same time, there was no amendment to the United States legislation aimed at creating the National Security Commission for the Chemicals Agency.
Macedonians vote in favour of the change in the national vote
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country into the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would also be a step to resolve the ten-year dispute with Greece, which has prevented the declaration of accession of Macedonia to the EU and NATO.
Greece, which is the province of Macedonia, claims that its original name constitutes a requirement for this territory and has refused to join Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made a new name for Macedonia, but the opposition from the international community claimed that the name would damage the international character of the Macedonian slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he was not planning to participate in the referendum and that the foreign campaign has raised doubts as to whether electoral activity will achieve the 50% share required for the referendum.
The referendum asks: "Will you join Macedonia with NATO and the EU in agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price paid by Macedonia, which is one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure accession with organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of our country and for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, as this means safe lives for all of us," said Skopje, 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they are following the outcome of the vote in order to change it.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament's votes are required.
The National Electoral Commission said that at 13:00 there are no reports of irregularity.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital of Macedonia in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and their son, Dushko, gave their voice on 30 September 2018 in the Macedonian referendum on the change in the name of the country, which would allow them to join NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, in front of a Parliament building in Skopje, prepared a small hall, raising the tower for those who fail to vote.
"We intend to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to connect our heads, not through the servants' doors," Kavadarkov said.
“We are poor countries, but we are still in error.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia, and get European-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would generate more than 20 % of the necessary investments in Macedonia.
"I believe that the vast majority support the change in the name, as more than 80% of the citizens take part in the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that "yes-word" would be "a confirmation of our future."
The results of the debate published on the first day of the Macedonian political investigation institution revealed that the vote was intended to take between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters who were required to vote.
Macedonia Telma TV addressed the public question that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these 70 percent said you would answer yes.
The success rate of the vote is 50 per cent plus one vote.
The motion for a resolution would be the first serious blow to the Government's Western policy after the government took over the management of the last year's May.
View: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes by color throughout Bridgeton's protection
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have been protected by Bridgeton, ensuring Manchester City 2–0 victory on Saturday at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero thought that his 65 - minute play-minute break had become ridiculously easy.
Argentinian attacker passed through the middle of the order.
He spoke through three Bridgeton guards before he could open the door.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green lakes.
He crossed another guard before he passed through several players across the Brighton prison line.
Then he threw himself on the left side where it was Sterling.
The English attacker used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his best foot to shoot Brighton's armory Mathew Ryanit on the right side of the network.
"Aguerol is a road problem," said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We said he's playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're sure he's going to blow the paint right now."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the first step in Premier League.
It's just a 29-minute drive.
Aguero got a ball in this game in Brighton's territory.
He sent a ball of air to Leroy Sane on the left.
You know, the word got a ball hit a few times before you drove to Sterling's far away.
Sky Blues hit the front of the network just before it came out of the border in Libya.
Manchester City plays the Master's Alagrup in Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 Rhein-Neckari Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play with the Rockies.
When the Nationals left out of the final tournament, there was no reason to start again.
But Scherzer hopes to make his country in Colorado Rocky on Sunday, but it is only when Rockie, who is leading NL West with a game of Los Angeles Dodger, is still hoping to win the final.
In Rockies, at least 5-2 won the National victory last night, but the team still wants to ensure the status of its first division.
"Even if we don't play for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing a public and other team here in the night of Denver is probably higher than any other game I can expect this year.
Why shouldn't I want to fight here?"
The nations have not yet been designated as revealors since the day, but they are alleged to be on the side of Scherzer's food in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th cooking, made a warm four-day meal and normally ate on holy day.
This best player in Washington leads 18-7, his ERA is 2,53, the number of outputs 300 and the number of advantages of its 220 2/3 at this time.
Trump needs a word of encouragement in West Virginia.
The President pointed out the immediate situation surrounding the selection of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court, while discussing the importance of electoral activity in the country.
“All we have done is in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important choices.
This is a great effort, which I do not apply, but actually as a candidate, which is why I am everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely violent group of democracies, and you see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they've decided to take back power by using any means.
They don't care who hurt them, whose power and control they have to drive, and only what they want is power and control over, and we don't give them that."
Democrats are in his statement on the mission, which aims to "against and prevent it".
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "a liar, a liar, a liar and a liar."
He referred the name to Senator Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate's Democratic Commission of Justice, who was greatly disturbed by the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you play this document?
So, uh, what?
No, no, no, wait, it was one of the worst physical examples, right next to the worst body I've ever seen."
The liberarian party is no longer a big community.
It's not about those who express their opinion.
If Momentemi's activists voted to understand my case, it wasn't surprising, though.
Finally, I am the last on the list of Members of Parliament who are told that you are not welcome, and that is all for the publication of my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, became a part of the same deal, as he stood firm for the Jewish opposition.
In my case, the judge counted me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are sometimes similar to those of Jeremy’s opening remarks to the leaders of the past.
Nottingham East, in a report from the Ministry of Labor, wrote that “we hope that the meetings will be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, the experience of the local Liberian member of Parliament for a period of eight years is exactly the same with the meetings of the General Assembly.
Today, this is no longer happening in the case of most meetings, and the promise of being in politics is forgotten when it has never been remembered.
It is clear from one point of view that the various aspects of the dispute are not accepted in the Leiborist Party and that any opinion which is acceptable to the board of the Party is assessed.
This began immediately after Jeremy became a leader. A colleague with whom I thought to share similar political views in the past was waiting now to change my mind and take a position that I would never have agreed otherwise, regardless of whether it is a matter of national security or of the single EU market.
Always, wherever I stand publicly, regardless of what I actually say, follows this judgment in the social media, expressing my refusal, especially the party's policies, and saying that I should not belong to the Liberal Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Of course, I know that I have more influence than some of my colleagues, since my comments are mostly political.
I admire the responsibilities and decision-making powers of my colleagues, who stand up every day for sexual or racial abuse, but I never swear.
One of the most misleading views in this policy area is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leiborist party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The fact is, however, that we are no longer so large in the community and that any change in the "untrust" initiative or election rules makes the party more rigid.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years to keep my head on the ground, to talk less, and "that would be all right."
But I didn't come to politics.
Since then, when I joined the Leiborist Party 32 years ago, motivated by the care of the Government of Thacheri, which had left me in my high school classroom with a direct view to harmonizing myself, I have tried to speak about better public services to those who need it most, acting as a member of the local Parliament and the Minister of Government.
I've never kept my policy, including the last elections.
In any case, it is not possible that no one in Nottingham East has been affected by the confusion about my political positions or the areas of non-conformity with the local government.
To all those who have promoted movements in order, I would like to say that when the country is moving towards Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand how I want to spend my time and energy, being a loyal leader of the Liberian team.
But actually, it's not the only message I have to think about Nottingham Momentemi, but to my supporters, whether they belong to the Libyan Party or not: I'm afraid to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of return or political assessment will not stop me from acting on behalf of what I think is in your best interests.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr moves tip
Two recent events could have pointed out the outcome to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves a great deal of the first win in the first game of Tenant.
They are now the only 10th of the table present to the team.
Finally, it was the high-level protection and better risk taking of the team, which led to the win of the team, and trainer Peter Murchiel has the full right to be at peace.
"We have been tested all the time during the games and have not yet won, so of course I'm happy," he said.
Robin Christie Melrose said, "I mean, they used their options better than ours."
Grant Andersoni's 14-minute test, which took over Frazier Climo, gave Ayr to the front, but to Captain Rory Hughes, who created the game Warriors, gave Melros a third card, where Jason Baggot failed the test.
Climo increased the influence of Ayri before the end of the semi-political regime, resulting in the end of 17-5 Ayr.
But Melrose successfully started the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, which took over Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
Then a long delay took place because of the serious injury that followed by the man in the candalam. As the game continued, Ayr continued to increase his performance thanks to the look of Stafford McDowall, who was sent by Climo.
Ayr's agent Blair Macpherson was then with a cool card, but then Melrose's player, Bruce Colvine, was reimbursed after a strong investigation into the failure of the transfer.
However, the team played outside, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to stop Climo without being thrown on the scene on the scene, MacPherson dropped the ball behind the previous Ayrides.
Climo continued, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe tried to get David Armstrong to the castle and sent Gregor Henry away on the fifth floor of the team playing outside.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to launch remote services after it was discovered that a man was appointed director of a well-known restaurant company.
A 56-year-old sample player plays on a BBC-known TV player that he writes and shows with a long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
A couple have learned that the previous nine hours can be the last row and Kiernan seems to be making life after Craiggang's new plan.
According to official records, he is the Director of the Company’s Afförmorn Limited.
The viewer refused to comment on the story, but the Scottish Sun said that Kiernan wants to stay in the "right restaurant".
"The sea is ours": seafarer Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen them to the extent of the Pacific Ocean
The seamen patrolling the La Paz are living on the seabed.
Oceanic lamps shall be lit at the premises of the Agency.
To the seabeds of Titicaca, until Amazonin is taken over, a decision has been made: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to restore it."
The entire seaport in Bolivia is a memory of the coastal zone that was lost to Chile in the 19th century in a bloody resource conflict. The same life is intended to remain on the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are the highest in the last decade, as Bolivia is waiting for a decision to expire on 1 October after the five-year negotiations in the International Court of Justice.
"Bolivia has a high spirit of unity and peace, and the country is waiting for a naturally distributed result," Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Calzadil said.
Many Bolivians throughout the country are looking forward to the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen, hoping that the Hague Court will benefit Bolivia, after which Chile has been obliged to hold negotiations with Bolivia for the last independent route to the sea for decades.
Bolivia's charismatic former President Evo Morales, who is waiting for the next year for a re-election against the office, is very much concerned with the decision of the first day.
"We are very close to getting back to the Black Ocean," he complained at the end of August.
However, some of the analysts believe that Bolivia’s case is likely not to benefit from the vote, or if it would turn out very little.
The United Nations Office in the Netherlands is not empowered to remove Chile's territory and it has provided that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is reduced only six months after the hearing of the final statements indicates that it was not a “curricular case”, said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And in the long run, the additional reasons for Bolivia may have been reduced in the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been stressed by the current authorities of Bolivia," Zárate said.
The moral war has lost all the remaining beauty of Chile, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile continue to negotiate for some time, but after all this is very difficult.
Two countries have not exchanged their recipients since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, who is Bolivian representative of Haagis, turned away from the idea that the decision-making process was inadequate.
The first day gives Bolivia "a chance to start a new-time state relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to end the 139-year-long divorces with mutual growth," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the presidents of Latin America, uses the sea issue to express political hatred.
"Bolivia will never refuse even access to the Pacific from its right," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea said the nuclear release will not take place until the United States can't trust the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never have the first nuclear war if Washington could not be trusted.
At the UN General Meeting on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the commitments made by the national leaders of the competitors at the Singapore summit.
He will comment on the case when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears almost to be starting again in the subversive nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Uni.
The Ri's statement is to deal with air threats, considering that the United States continues to restrict and refuse to stop the war with Korea, allows North Korea to surrender.
Washington is carefully referring to such a statement when Pyongyang does not take the first important step towards the same disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want you to meet again.
However, there has been widespread skepticism that Pyongyang intends to seriously put down an armament, which the country is likely to see as the only way to secure its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree to another Kim and Trumpy meeting.
Paris men produce a series of massive cuts from my viewers that will bring my buyers to the buyers living in their neighborhood
If you want to increase your library collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to find it anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought to the forests a wide variety of topsoils that covered Paris’s forests in 2019.
High and ineffective bubbles are this summer man through Instagram, and these designers have sent their foot-and-mouthed creatures to the molluscs.
Valentino's tipper was covered with a cross-sectioned green cube that had been decorated with a reminder of a wide variety of colors.
Among the other major clothing items were made with jewelry in the analytics, hairdressers, and the generals, but their aim should not be to warm them.
Tom Browne also showed the choice of the weird masks, doing it right before Halloween.
Most of the colourful masks were assembled, so they remembered more Hannibal Lecter than high-moded.
One part of the creation mentioned the movement cost of air and coal, while the other recalled the freezing of waste.
And if you continue with high-level marine activities, you're lucky.

John Edward: Language is important to the world
Special schools have been standing at the stage of academia, and this has continued with the following eye-opening studies in 2018, which strengthens personal and joint success in sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
These schools, where more than 30,000 students are enrolled throughout Scotland, and which are represented by the Scottish Special Council (SCIS), are seeking to provide their students and their parents with the best service.
The aim of special schools is to prepare your students for additional and higher education, their chosen livelihood and their place as citizens of the world.
As a learning sector that can design and implement a program adapted to values, we see that modern languages are constantly known and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you talk to a person in a language that he understands, it can touch him.
When you talk to him in his mother's womb, it's going to reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can only support English if we want to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's fresh test results, we see that there are languages in the table, where the number of exams is the highest in individual schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who learned foreign, high score A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students received Mandarin at the price of A, the same price was obtained in Germany by 72 percent of students, 69 percent of French-language students and 63 percent of Spanish-language students.
This shows that Shoto's private schools support the Internet as a life of important skills that children and young people need in the future without any doubt.
The languages that are now in the choice of subjects are similar to those of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in individual schools and other schools.
A 2014 study of the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) revealed that for reasons why workers find it difficult to find workers at work, although 17% of them responded to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future work.
As long as the expected employment packages require a language skills, such skills will become essential in a global world.
In spite of the choice of course, learning another language gives a real advantage in the future, since language skills are vital.
The ability to communicate directly to citizens of foreign countries gives a wide range of people an immediate competitive approach.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom reported that 75 per cent of the respondents in the case of YouGo did not speak enough online enough to hold this conversation. The only language in which the percentage of participants was bilingual was 15 per cent in French.
That is why funding for language education is important for children today.
In a number of languages, especially the languages of developing countries, learning will give children a better opportunity to find a good job.
There are different languages in each school.
Many schools focus on classical contemporary languages, while other schools teach language that is considered the most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Despite the interests of the child, it is always possible to choose a number of languages that teachers in their area teach.
Special schools have dedicated themselves to the offer of such a school environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what the future holds for them.
No longer can it be said that in a global business society, languages are superior to the future of the country, so it must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should truly be considered an international language.
Special schools continue to offer young tourists the choice, diversity, and independence.
You have to do it.

LeBron does his Lakers Debt on San Diego's Christmas Day
The fans don't have to wait to see LeBron James doing his Debt in Los Angeles Lakes anymore.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton reported that James is playing in the Christmas celebration against San Diego.
But the number of minutes of his games must be determined.
"It's over one and under 48," said the official website of Walton Lakers.
Lakers report Mike Trudell's suspicion that James is probably playing a number of minutes.
The training that took place last week was asked by James about his plans with regard to the six-year-old Graphic of Lakers.
"I don't need my career at the current stage of the lead game to warm myself," he said.
Trumpi-Virginia Selection Campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch his election campaign event series tonight in Wheelingus West Virginia.
For the first week of the campaign, Trumpi has been scheduled for five weeks, including stopping in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time as the vote for confirmation remains until Trump, who is elected to be appointed to the Office for the Freedom of the Supreme Court, is seeking to increase its support for the preliminary interim preparations, as the Liberal Class threatens the abolition of control at Congress after the vote in November.
What is to happen to Trump's campaign in West Virginia tonight, and how is it viewed on the Internet?
The Trump campaign event in Wheelingus West Virginia will take place on Saturday evening, 29 September 2018 at 19:00 p.m.
Trumpi-Virginia campaign event can be viewed on the Internet through YouTube’s campaign.
It is likely that Trump's High Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, will be talking about the week of the week that changed into a temporary relationship with sexual abuse charges. At the same time, the Senate's statement of confirmation is suspended for the week until the FBI is examining the matter.
However, the main objective of the campaign is to help the new race to meet with the liberals who stand in November with the complex choices.
As a result, President Trumpy said that the aim of their five-week campaign was to "encourage volunteers and supporters when liberals try to protect them and extend them to most of the Senate and the Essena people,” Reuters said.
"The control of the Congress is so important for the president's agenda that Trump is driving at the speed of the electoral campaign in many countries as soon as possible," said Reuters to the Prime Minister Trump, who did not want to mention his name.
Today's campaign campaign, planned to take place at Wesbanco Stadium Wheelingus, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and also to be interviewed in the Pittsburgh media," said the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, it will take a second time when Trump visits West Virginia during the last month. It will be with the country where he received more than 40 percent of the votes of the voters in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morriseyd from the Republic of West Virginia, who is responsible for conducting the draft policy on the basis of the issues.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has come to celebrate his results," said political scientist Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. men share in the struggle by keeping their hopes in front of Sunday's solos
After three consecutive sessions, the games that took place in the afternoon were just what Ryder Cup needed.
There is a lot of confusion in the game, but players really believe in it, especially in the competitions like this here.
So, where would they think it was now?
"They led six points from which they have now received four, so I think I can think of it as a small turning point," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, this is clear, because it is guided by four points and 12 points are still in play.
Spieth says Americans feel that they don't have enough wind speeds, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the eyes of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played with each other all day and each received three points of four.
Spieth has been as sharp as the gray and shows an example.
These going up the hill became ever more popular with each circle, hiding a flat hole that would have brought four to the fifth floor after he and Thomas were in two countries.
He's an idiot who won a match on the 15th, sent a similar song, which showed a man's belief that Americans are not out of the fight yet.
"You just have to play at the center and worry about your ride," said Spieth.
It's the only thing players can do yet.
18 doors to keep track.
The only players that have more points than Spiethil and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup, on the stars of Francesco Molina and Tommy Fleetwood
Europe's funny, but it's four of four, and nothing can go wrong.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't break the day after Sunday after Sunday, avoiding the bogeys also on Saturday morning, on the train after Sunday and on the back of one train in the morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into the vast audience, when back there, strengthens the view that players who fight on Sunday and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, it is not possible to confirm the victory of Europe as well as the most famous players like Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both of them are preferable in different windows at the same time.
However, there is a forecast of Europe's darkness.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia, with a four-ball tonight, fast work when a man had a couple with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two times the first one complained in Spanish and Russian so deeply that they had no hope to complain out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one who's gonna help you out of August.
It is very difficult for the four-step and pairs to look closely at just the relationship between the pairs, the advice given to each other, the rest of the advice, and because of how the way can change with time.
Europe has played a better role as a team and has been leading a strong advance for the last few days, but it has shown at these four sessions that the United States team is engaged in a fight with some, especially Americans, who have doubled.
European is located in Ryder Cup on the last day 10-6
In the last day of Ryder Cup, Europe will be able to take the lead in the United States in the wake of the four-day rounds and pairs of games.
The great Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two battles in the face of the difficult Tiger Woods to raise their last score in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorni, a European side that contributed two years ago to the preservation of the lost car in Hazeltine, was ruled after a raid by the United States in the morning in the fourth floor, with a series of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance, won two games, but they couldn't replace the missing game.
Jim Furyki's party needs a 12-day single game to keep the dog alive.
Fleetwood is the first European leader to win four points, along with Molinar, who is called Mollinwood after this weekend, they are the second couple who have won in Ryder Cup in their four openings.
Having destroyed the four-places of Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued the same spirit, defeating Woods and the American founder of Bryson Dechambeau: 5-4.
Woods, who destroyed himself on Saturday through two games, showed a random series, but now lost his 29 four-and-a-a-half game 19, getting seven out of sequence.
Justin Rose, who had gone out in the morning as a four-year-old, married with partner Henrik Stanson, won 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who is in the world's first and third places.
This has not been successful in Europe, although the struggle seemed to be pleasant and windy without Paris on the southern side.
Three-fold Grandfathers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for the American class on Saturday.
They won a four-pound victory over Spain 2-1 Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter later and won the pairing of Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3, losing two openings.
Only two times in the Ryder Cup history, the team has come back from a quarter-point shortage, in single-games, although the owner needs only a week to keep the dog alive by Furyk.
Although it took two days to get better elsewhere, it seems that after Sunday’s protest, it didn’t happen to them.
North Korea says that 'no matter' they do not make themselves armed because of lack of confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Friday that the continuing restrictions strengthened their distrust of the United States and that the country was not planning to release its nuclear warheads under these conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Organisation's annual meeting that North Korea has taken "significant improvements" over the last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the detonation of the nuclear test site and the granting of the authorisation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see that the United States would have responded to it," he said.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we lack security in our country, and in such circumstances we do not agree in any way to make ourselves the first weapon."
Although R R has repeatedly been known as the charges against Washington's “secondary” approach to nuclear-free change on the basis of which North-Korea will be released when he stands for a temporary match, it seemed important in his statement that he did not refuse to abandon a single nuclear resistance, as he has done in the past in Pjongjang.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trumpi on 12 June, at a meeting of the President of the United States and the North Korean League, when Kim agreed to move to the South Korea nuclear defence, and Trump agreed to the North Korea Security Council.
North Korea has wanted the official end of the Korean war 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been faced with challenges to overcome the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
"The US calls for ‘the first phase of nuclear disarmament’ and increases the burden of restrictions in order to achieve their objective systematically, even in response to the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“I think the restrictions on our birth are a dream to people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continuing limitations add to our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plan for the second summit of Kim and Trump, which the United States leaders highlighted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the last five months of the meeting between the three Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae and added: "If one of the parties to the issue of nuclear resistance would be South Korea, not the United States, the issue of nuclear resistance in Korea would not have come to such an end."
On the other hand, R was different from last year's when he told the United Nations Chief Assembly that the conversion of North Korea's rockets to the US mandrake was inappropriate after Mr. Paha President Trump named Kim's self-propelled mission as a "racite".
Today, thanks to the fact that in the past year, North Korea has completely destroyed the threat of Trump in the United Nations, Kim, for his courage to stand up for the same armament, but in addition, that there is still much to be done and that restrictions must remain until the nuclear end of North Korea.
On the third day, Trump said that he had no time for this, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should be informed of the measures taken by Pjongjang.
At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council’s restrictions must continue to be strong and persistent until we are fully and completely assured of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea, trying to prevent the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo's meeting with Riga United Nations headquarters was on the contrary and later said he'd visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea this year three times this year, although the last trip was not going very well.
After a meeting with the Jewish Pyongyang, he said that we had made progress, after which he understood in North Korea only within a few hours of the "Gangster Islands' demands" after the trial.
In this month of meeting with Moon, North Korea granted permission to launch rockets and nuclear complexes when the United States implemented "compliant measures".
He said that Kim had told him that under the "controversial measures" he had been making a view of the security measures permitted by Trump Singapore and the normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to clean up enough
In this year, Harvard University offers a new course where students have to sleep more and more to fight growing aggressive culture, where they are taught by late-night school marathons.
Students who love academicism at the world’s best universities are often helped when they do so by their own basics of care.
Professor Charles Czeisler of Harvard Medical School, and Professor Brighami, and Professor of Women's Health at the University of Harvard Medical School, consider this to be the first real estate in the United States.
He was inspired by the creation of a course when he spoke about how sleep disorders affect learning.
“ At the end of that, a girl came to me and asked, ‘ Why am I still told about this, my last year of high school?’
He said that no one had ever told him how important it was - it made me sick," he explained to the Telegraph.
The course that became the first class this year explains to the students how good surprises contribute to academic and sports outcomes and also help to improve their overall welfare.
Professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the director of the University of Health Paul Barreira said that the university decided to pursue the course after it was found that the students were at work in a real sleep.
The course of the hours includes a number of counteractive tasks.
In one part, a picture of the community is presented. There students can click on the charts, cards, sports books and books and explain the effects of caffeine and light on the effects of sleeplessness on sports outcomes and the normal importance of sleep.
The second part explains to participants how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, fatigue and low risk.
The map, together with the antitypical symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this does not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the effects of cigarette smoking on health," Professor Czeisler added.
In his statement, the emphasis continues to be placed on other teaching subjects, adding that modern technology and the increasing burden on students is more important than the fact that sleeplessness is a growing problem.
“Ensuring a permanent quality sleeper should be a student’s “salvation” with which to fight stress, pregnancy and entrepreneurship,” he added. “It helps even against the rise of the body, as sleeplessness makes the brain’s hunger, in other words, permanently hungry.”
From California, 19-year-old professor of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler to create a course, having participated in one of his previous classes, in his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to help with the creation of a university course.
In the next step, he wishes all graduates of the curriculum to be able to join the same school programme before joining the competition authority.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a sleeping room for both sleep and escape, and be aware of the harmful effect of the "insane light" created by electronic screens and LED lighting, as this can cause damage to their daily routine and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Very expensive Alistid men Gerrard
The Rangers suffered the result of a series of warm hospitality, when Dolly Menga, who sent by Steven Gerrard, led 1-0 victory to Livingston.
On the Ibrox side, he promised to get his first guest from February, which was signed 4-1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused the second murder of Gerard in 18 games, leaving eight points below the head of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
I shot my color seven minutes before the half and the irony of Rangers couldn't recover from it.
The Rangers therefore descends to the sixth place, Livingston ascends to the third place, leaving only one hole in the hibernation.
For Rangers, there may not have been any problems, because their attacker Calum Spence needs the main treatment after he got hit with the apparently abandoned object.
Gerard made eight changes on the side that led to the crossing of the Ayrist and Bethfred Cup semifinal.
At the same time, however, he went along with Livi 11 who took a point last week and would have been at peace with how well-trained boys burned their opponents at every step.
The Rangers could have been more powerful, but Livingston did much more with his job.
They should have broken the paint in the second opening minute, when our first exchange sent Scott Pittman through the Allan McGregor color, but the semi-protector did not take advantage of his opportunity.
Mr. Keaghan Jacobs' release was then found by Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to do only a large card job at the end of the day.
Yes, the Rangers did, but they have more hope than believe in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos knew clearly that if he met Steven Lawles at 15 minutes of play, Judge Steven Thomson was not satisfied with the charges of Columbian player.
In Ranger, the first half managed to make my target only two shots, but the former Ibrox bomber Liam Kelly didn't feel any anxiety about leaving Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria after the operation.
Although Livi's 34-minute opening could break the rules of the game, no one can complain that they're wrong because of their preferences.
Again, Rangers couldn't track Jacobs' deep weights.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher shot Scott Robinson, who kept peace and chose Mega, who just finished the plan.
Gerard's acting in the meantime, switching to Coulibaly Ryan Kent. This exchange would cost himself almost as soon as the obstetrician broke down Morales, but the memorable Kelly tried to stop her place.
But Livingston continued to entertain visitors to play exactly the kind of game that suits them where Lithgow and Halkett fixed up a long ball.
At the end of the day, it would have been possible to promote your case, but McGregor stood firm, preventing Jacobs before Lithgow broke off his big sword.
Mr. Ranger's deputy, Glenn Middleton, asked for a prison sentence again when he and Jacob went up, which Thomson did not rest again.
Almanah: Geiger lodger discoverer
And now on our website Sunday Morning in Almanah: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and LOENDADES ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. It was designed with a device that eventually took five devices that are known as Geiger's Loendurun.
Based on this knowledge, Geiger also became the founder of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado, where they were, in general, the invisiblely unfathomable producers of the goods of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this yet?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger reader used to locate radioactive minerals, such as cancer.
It is possible to hear from the atoms separated from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans says: “Don’t say that, but it still does! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his name is still alive.
A new vaccine can teach the immune system to “scream” pepttur-like
A new vaccine can teach the immune system to “scream” the pettur plant and kill them.
Vaccine teaches you to recognize the immune system as part of your treatment
The method includes taking immunosuppressants from the patient and changing their cells in the laboratory
Then they can be a single white for many particles and they will be injected back.
The vaccine in the study shows the results of various reductions in patients with varying degrees.
In one woman who was treated with a vaccine to detect the immune system, her ovarian cancer increased for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" white, which has been spread for various HER2 particles, and then they are injected back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Minority Institute in Bethesdas Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a very high level of vaccine."
HER2 "leads the growth of many small species", including breast, ovarian, caps and colorectal roots, explained Professor Berzofsky.
The approach of treatment of certain types of leukaemia has been used in patients with immunosuppression and education.
Kanye West started with the spirit supported by Trumpi , putting the SNL in direct control of MAGA .
It didn't go very well.
You can get a Saturday Night Live studio cost Kanye West towards a vicious vicar, after he made an infamous statement that he thanked US President Donald Trumpi and announced his application to the same office in 2020.
After that night, his third song, called Ghost Town, and where he sang the music with the book Make America Great, began to protest against democracies and repeated his support for Trump.
“I have talked so much to white people who ask me, ‘ How do you like Trump, he's from the race?
"If I were racist after so much anxiety, I'd already been out of America," he said.
The SNL set up a device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood heard a joke about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Committee of Judges on the alleged sexual violence of Christine Blasey Fordi.
Although this section did not go to the Etruscan, the West Academy of Sciences was launched into Chris Rocki's social media.
It's not clear whether Rock tried to paint the West post.
He also complained to the West public that he had some difficulty with his muscles.
“They laughed at me behind the floor.
They said I wouldn't go there, not in my head.
They fucked me up!
And then they say I'm up," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see my Superman Keebeit?
Try with love."
At least two times, his comments were rejected by viewers, and it seemed that SNL's team was weak. According to the variation, one person said: "The whole studio was dead."
The West had been produced at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande, because the last boy's boyfriend, Uncle Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
The West surprised many of the songs "I Love it", which he appeared as a Perrier bottle during the presentation.
The West received support from the conservative group TPUSA led by Candace Turner, who concluded: “The only safe angel: TÉNAME, AND JULGESSID RAHVAMASSILE VASTU HAKATA.”
But Lieutenant Karen Hunter concludes that West was just "the one who he is, and it's completely amazing."
"While I decided to assist MITTE (by taking my music or clothing or by supporting his "art") someone who believes in me and spreads to my society a harmful world view.
He's free.
Like we are," she says.
Before sending out a rapper on Twitter said he's changed his name, saying he's now "andine Kanye West."
He's not the first song to change his presentation, according to Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dog has also named Snoop Lion and, of course, the music singer Prince, who changed his name into a symbol.

The sound of the troones game Kit Harington does not approve of fat masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its outstanding role in Jon Snowina HBO in the violent middle fantasy series in the Troons game.
But the indicator (31) puts down an aggressive neck stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that "something's gone wrong" and raised the question of how to solve the cold problem of masculinism in #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie (31), admitted that she feels “strongly lonely” that this problem needs attention.
"I feel very personally now that we have gone somewhere wrong with men," he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up with regard to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that the rise in fat masculinity is partly responsible for television, as there are cross-border events.
He continued: “What is wrong with you, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and today gives young boys the feeling that they should be just like they want to be men.
I think it's really one of the biggest questions in our time - how to change it?
'Cause obviously something's gone wrong for young people."
In the debate, he also acknowledged that after the end of the series, after the next summer, no member of the Troonist game will ever participate, saying that he is “on the one hand with his warriors and horses.”
Since November, Kit Sam Shepardi is involved in the restoration of True West, which speaks of a filmmaker and his jealous friend.
The exhibitor recently announced that he has to meet his wife, Rose, for the best thing about the Troons game.
"I met my wife in this meeting, so it gave me my future family and my future," he said.
Rose played with Emmy in the fantasy career of Ygrintte, a real-time john Snow lover.
A few marriages in the family of Leslie in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased dramatically to 14%.
According to healthcare professionals, more than 820,000 people are infected with this disease.
Only about 40,000 new events were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new events have resulted in sex, in the past.
In general, HIV spread through some blood transfusions that have been contracted in China .
However, in this way, the number of people infected with HIV has decreased almost zero, confirming the health authorities of China at a conference held in the province of Yunnan.
Annually, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between the LGBT names is allegedly large.
However, because of the country’s ageing values, studies show that 70-90% of men who are sexually active end up marrying women.
Many transmissions of diseases are linked to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has agreed to use general access to HIV medicines to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters prevents the worker from downloading GOP Senator's data, saying that it is "hazardous lies" and "waterborne authorities"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters explained on Saturday that his employer had posted personal data from the three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia websites.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims spread the “ultra-parapoly” trollies and their websites.
"Vals, lies and even more devastating lies," said Waters in his Twitter release.
The information published was alleged to contain the addresses and telephone numbers of Utahs of Senators Lindsey Graham (Lunau-Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utah).
Information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate panel regarding the allegations of sexual assault against the candidates of the State Court against Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was posted a few times after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Old websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the mail, was connected to the Waters Office and issued a member information from the employee under Waters, said Hill.
"This unfounded claim is a complete and absolute lie," Waters continued.
“My staff, whose personality, personal data and safety are threatened by their false and false claims, are not responsible in any way for this information.
This unreasonably false claim is complete and irreversibly false."
Water's release was quickly calculated on the Internet, including one of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This promotion is going to be angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This refers to his feelings that are not appropriate to the members of the Congress.
If anyone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They can't be trots.
They must not be suspicious of the offender's motives.
They must remain calm."
Fleischer showed a similar reaction to the critics of the Waters' reaction to the critics of Kavanaugh, who accused the critics of being too angry during the four-day hearing.
Also the liberal candidate Omar Navarro, who is applying for Waters in inter-elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's true if it's true," he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned "the relevant agencies of the Agency and the legal authorities concerned with their fraudulent claims."
"Let us do all we can to clarify the perpetrators," he continued, "and that they should be legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Film Johnny English Strings Reviews - based on Rowan Atkinson spy parody
It is now common to look for the meanings of Brexit in all new British films, and this seems to be particularly appropriate for Johnny English's memorabilia in the parody series, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was followed in 2011 by the restoration of Johnny English Reborn.
Would it be humouring over ourselves if we were obviously stupid in the new export opportunity of the country?
In any case, Johnny English has been allowed to do things in his own way in a way that is in a puny way - and that this broad, co-cominal creation is meant for non-English-speaking film narratives.
Of course, it is with a secret agent who, despite his poor pretence to mutate-glamour, remembers some Clouseau'd, Mr. Bean's and some of the works that led to the award of Chariots of Fire to London for the 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the event on the trip and the international secret at Atkinson, which once played on Barclaycard's television shows, which only leaves behind the scenes.
There's only one or two nice moments in this JE film.
I liked the approach of Johnny English to the helicopter when he wore the middle wheels and the chopsticks of his hat.
Atkinsone is shown to be a physical comedy, but noise seems less intense and strangely superior, especially when "inspired" spy films such as 007 and Mission Imposible also offer self-contained comedy.
It seems that this noise is more thought of to children than adults, and for me, Johnny English plans have not been as obvious and focused as the Atkinson horror movies Beanina.
Now there is an ongoing current assumption that Britain is in serious danger.
Küberhäkker has become aware of the UK's overcrowded spy network, revealing all British secret police personnel, preparing the local agent for a huge fraud - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last wave for the prime minister, who is a long and urgent worker who supports political non-population: Emma Thompson is doing this in a great way, but there is not much in the manuscript that works.
Her attorneys recommend that since all active spying is dangerous, she should call back someone who has left the pension.
And this means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster at one of the most promising institutions, sharing your knowledge of how to be a secret agent: there are some good things about English where the School of Rock type offers spy school.
English will be aired in an extraordinary way to inform Whitehall and will be reunited with his ex-boyfriend Bugh, who will play again Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a low-level captain, who is an example of Vicki Pepperdine's servants who have been seriously injured.
So Batman and Robin, his Majesty's lack of secret service is again in operation, meeting Olga Kurlälenko, who was replaced by a beautiful five-fat Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is dangerously under the arms of a charismatic technical billionaire. The company claims that it can solve all British accounting problems: lucky Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their dress clothes: hiding themselves as a promoter, they come to the French restaurant; they create chaos, hiding the secret of Volta's luxury boat; and English runs any arrangements when he tries to use a virtual reality complex to meet Volta's entrance.
In this last section, there are no stops, but both in love and in tears as well, there are children's TV milk all the time.
Over the middle of the class.
And as for other Johnny English films, I thought: Is British film industry really not giving Rowan Atkinson a role that would be fair for his talent?
The working party shall not prepare a plan where the British work for four days a week, but shall pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's working party has considered a reverse plan that provides for the British to work for four days a week, but they will be paid for five days.
The Party wishes that the company's transfers should be forwarded to the workers who have been granted an additional day of freedom through the artistic creation revolution (AI).
That would be a three-day shift for workers, but they'd get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would be compatible with the economic action plan of the party and thus the country would be expected to calculate for the benefit of workers.
The fourth working day is approved at the Trade Union Congress in order to prevent workers from using the changing economy.
The working party’s source said to The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a review of the draft will be made known by the end of the year.
"It does not take place overnight, but on Thursday night there is an attempt to bring together a party's approach to balance the economy for the benefit of both the workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The working parties are not the first to support such ideas, because the Rohelist Party also allowed four-day working weeks during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the effort is not currently supported as a whole by the Labour Party.
The Working Party's president announced: “The party's policy is not discussed on Thursday night and the party's party does not discuss it.”
Assetser John McDonnell used a workshop last week to clarify his view of the socialist turnout in the economy.
McDonnell said that he had decided to take back the power of community companies "probably guided" and "primary-services".
Assets’ plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies are not likely to get back all their share, as the Labour Party could make a "failure" in relation to the expected value.
He confirmed his plan to put workers in business boards and to create own funds to provide 10% of private sector equity workers, instead of granting annual benefits up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in the phrase "60 Minutes", whether the FBI study of Kavanaughi can change their mind
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, by the FBI, has accelerated the final vote on the application of the Court of Justice for at least one week and raises the question whether the conclusions of the Bureau could affect the termination of voluntary senators' support.
During the day of the debate, you were asked by Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, head of the "60-minutes" of Scott Pelley's liberal classes, if the FBI could reveal anything that might make them think otherwise.
Kennedy seemed as open as his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I'd go to the hearing, and I said I'd talk to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges had been issued and asked, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive, sure and consistent."
The sound of Graham seems to be on the rocks.
"I'm sure of my decision concerning Brett Kavanaugh and could only change it in the bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how this happened, but I know that Brett didn't really do it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all those whom he has named cannot confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new coming."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped to reduce poverty?
On Saturday the New York Global Citizen Festival will organise an annual music event, which has a truly memorable audience and the same memorable goal: to eliminate poverty from the world.
Now, seven times, the Global Citizen Festival looks at tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn not only enjoying songs like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is the Global Poverty Project extension of the Global Poverty Project. It is with the International Law Group, which hopes to end poverty, by continuously increasing the number of people who fight against it.
In order to get the company's free tablet (if it does not want to pay for the VIP tablet), the conservators had to perform many tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to some world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been when they've been reaching their goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert is a real way to persuade them to act or is it simply a follow-up click, where people feel they are doing something important, signing a statement on the Internet or on the Internet?
Since 2011, more than 19 million "activity" has been registered by Global Citizen, trying to achieve many different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $37 billion of the commitments and policies affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 obligations and notifications resulting from their activities and of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the secured funds have now directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Some major commitments include the partnership of investors and implementing partners in the United Kingdom, The Power of Nutrition, which has committed to "encourage all the opportunities of children," allowing Rwanda to grant $35 million in order to help the country end its subsidisation after more than 4700 maintenance from the Global Citizen.
"In support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we will be able to become a historic milestone in social injustice," said The Power of Nutrition, the great Tracey Ullman, during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5000 activities called for the improvement of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced the funding project The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in the food sector.
In reply to one KKK’s website, which asks, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and hard way - sometimes we lose and fail.
But as we face great civil rights and divisive movements, we are confident of our success because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Card B, Janelle Monée are just a few of the participants who take over this year's event in New York, which leads Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use a seabed to prevent the Minister for Energy Export of Russia
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington may, if necessary, use its marine resources to prevent the capture of the Russian energy market, including the Middle East, has been published by US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's participation in Syria, particularly when it acts at the request of the legal government, is the next step in the investigation of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to exchange energy as they do it in Eastern Europe, South Europe," he claimed.
And the official's statement has a way of resolving it.
“In the United States, this is an opportunity to ensure that the seas are open and, where necessary, prevented, their energy from entering the market,” he added.
The Zinke statement was translated into the partners of the Consumer Energy Alliance, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is made up of a non-profit company, which represents itself as a "energy user's voice".
He went to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less, powering and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "one-third-third-point-point", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These declarations will come when the Government of the Trumpi has been reimbursed to increase the exports of land to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much easier option for European consumers.
To that end, the authorities of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to drive Germany itself out of the "unlimited" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, in Trump's words, transformed Berlin into Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar North Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles its current power to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington's real response to the project has been simply awarded for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of publicizing stress and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Minister of Energy of Russia, Alexander Novak, in September Moscow, when he met with US energy minister Rick Perry.
The US guard has received back employment from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Union (BDI) invited the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and from Berlin and Moscow bilateral agreements.
"I have a big problem when a third country is taking action on our energy equipment," said the President of the German Union (BDI), Dieter Kempf, after the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Germany.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considered presidential candidate in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Wednesday that he considered the presidential candidate for inter-elections.
At Holyoke's funeral, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his nomination.
"Women have time to go to Washington and improve our corrupt government and this includes the first reading," he said in The Hill.
"After 6 November, I consider myself to be a very presidential candidate."
Warren also assessed the activities of President Donald Trumpi, saying that “the country is moving in the wrong direction.
"I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," he said.
Warren has published Trumpi and its highest-ranking candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On the line, Warren concluded: "Of course we need to vote before the FBI investigation."
However, the debate published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters do not think he should apply in 2020.
In the Suffolki University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe, 58% of the "probably" voters considered that the senator should not be candidateed.
32% supported such candidacy.
The question showed more support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38% supported the possible candidate and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to the possible 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Bident and Senator Bernie Sander.
Biden said he's officially decided to become a janitor, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Palin writes Donald Trumpi on the collection of Track Palini PTSD-d
Track Palin (26) announced the recruitment of the year for Iraq from September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic crime case and was charged.
"What my son lives through what he's trying to come back, I can stand up with other families who know the consequences of PTSD and the damage our soldiers are experiencing," he told the audience at the Donald Trumpi Assembly in Tulsa in Tulsa.
I called on my son to be detained “in an airstrip” and said with regard to his son and other soldiers that “they will return a little differently, they will come back as Karastats, they will come back to see whether there is enough respect for what the soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the country.”
He was arrested on the first day of Vasillas Alaska and the police department, President Dan Bennett's statement, charged him with assault on a woman in the village hall, arresting her in the civil war report and possession of her gun.
18 countries and the Colombia region are anticipating a new asylum policy
Eight countries and the Colombia region support the legal challenge of a new US policy that prohibits victims of asylum who flee from force or homelessness.
The representatives of 18 countries and the region presented short-term press releases in Washington to support the challenging policy associated with the asylum seeker, reported NBC News.
The full name of the hacker, Grace v. Session, was not published in August of the American Union of Civil Liberties against EU policies.
The woman said that her associate “and the sons of his violent gangs” abused her, but the U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on 20 July.
She's in Texas.
Grace's national attorneys described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as a country producing large amounts of asylum seekers in the United States, where there is a major problem of power and homelessness.
A new U.S. asylum policy was recast with a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed documents to be issued to the immigrants to be withdrawn from the domestic asylum application.
Professor Karl Racine of the Colombia Region stated in a statement that the new policy "is extending the international law of the country, the Union and the international law for decades".
‘The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be resolved in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such a requirement violates this principle,’ was the case in the summary of the case law.
In the short term, lawyers also claimed that refusing entry into the country of immigrants would damage the US economy by saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "providing the necessary employment".
The chief prosecutor, Jeff Session, ordered the immigration attorney to no longer give shelter to victims of domestic violence and violence.
"The asylum application is available to those who leave their home country for insurance or for fear of race, religion, nationality or some social group or political opinion," the session said in its Communication of 11 June.
It was never intended to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems that people face every day.
Funeral rescue operations in Palus where deaths have been doubled in the fight against the finding of survivors
The situation in the rest of the world was even more threatening.
"The situation is very severe," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who was able to comfort her in the city’s evacation center of Palu.
“After every minute, you will get new people quickly.
Clean water isn't enough."
The people came into their destroyed homes, sorting things over and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were infected and diseases that had been damaged by 7.5-magnitude soil color were eliminated.
Some injured, including a broken liver and an avalanche in the hands of the poor Dwi Haris washed out of the Palu army, where patients were treated with persistent constipation due to persistent constipation.
The pears filled her eyes when she remembered how the strong earth-colored woman grabbed her fifth round hotel suite, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
"It's time to save yourself.
I think I've been killed in security against the wall," said Haris Associated Press, adding that his family had come in dust.
“I heard my wife crying, but then it was clear.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're not safe."
The U.S. Attorney-General accuses China of "sustaining advertising"
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published under the United States newspaper four newspaper advertisements on the daily benefit of the US-China counter-trafficking, the United States charged major Chinese Beijing with using the US press to spread the propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the addendum paid by China Daily on the three-day day in the Register of Des Moines - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - after China was charged with intervention in the United States Congress on 6 November, which China does not.
The Trump accused Beijing of trying to intervene in the US elections marked what the U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in the extensive campaign in Washington to announce the crisis in China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertising for the promotion of trade, Beijing and Washington are now growing in a trade war where the import rate is adjusted.
In the beginning of the Chinese tariff war, measures were considered to have been taken by countries such as Iowa exporters, as they supported the Trompi Liberals' parties, and experts in China and the USA have explained.
The US raised China and former Iowa copperr, as well as China's largest exporter of agricultural products Terry Branstad said Peking was hurting American workers, agricultural producers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his book Des Moines Register on Sunday: “China has now doubled its temptation by publishing a disclaimer in our free paper. ”
"In the publication of its propaganda, the Chinese Government uses the American expression freedom and the free advertising habit, Des Moines in the Register has placed its reputation advertising," wrote Branstad.
"On the contrary, the Peking region only has a limited voice and does not really see the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the economic direction of China, considering that the media is a certain part of the Chinese Communist Party," he added.
He added that one of China's most outstanding historians refused to publish his article, but he didn't tell me what history was.
Analyticals warn that the Liberals attract female voters before the inter-elections with the Kavanaugh Church
While many liberals are waiting and protecting Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh, who have been charged with multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they see a return during the previous inter-elections, especially for women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been widespread and most of the Liberals have already shown that they want to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be taken back," said Professor Grant Reeher of the School of Political Sciences at the University of Syracuse, in an article published in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute's effort to investigate the FBI is sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said a number of progressive group of MoveOn parents and national representative Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC.
On Friday morning, the audiences "November is coming!" in their Senate corridor, because the Liberals, who control the courts, decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidate, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Fordi's recognition, told Mic.
"Democratic input and internal flow are starting to disappear from the graphicity," said political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this may be higher, especially in the case of female voters and 18-29-year-olds who do not like the president and who often lose voice."
Even before Fordi’s public testimony, which described his allegations of sexual assault against the candidate of the State Court, the analysts predicted that if the liberals continued to move, they would continue.
"It has become very confusing for the GOP," said the former President of the Committee of Liberals, Michael Steele NBC News earlier last week.
"It is not only about the Commission's vote, the final vote, and whether Kavanaugh will be put to office, it also concerns how the Liberals have dealt with it and how they have met it," led the U.S. priority group (a group that helps the democratics to choose) to pay attention to the new channels.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided by those who believe after the witnesses for Fordi and who Kavanaughi, but much more support than the first.
YouGovi’s new question showed that 41% of the respondents believed in certain or likely Fordi’s testimony, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought that Kavanaugh was lying or probably lying during his testimony, while only 30% thought about Fordi.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Fordi and at least one of the other charges of Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
The previous week, Ford announced before the Senate Committee that Kavanaugh would attack him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate of the State Court showed him his views when they participated in the 1980s during the study in Yale.
The World Wide Web browser is planning to launch a new Internet that will connect to Google and Facebook
World Wide Web browser Tim Berners-Lee launched an Idu firm that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project inrupt is the company that builds the Berners-Lee open source code for the Solid platform.
Solids allow users to choose where their data is stored and which people are given access to information.
In a unique debate, the firm was told by Berners-Lee that Inrupt's goal is "world governance".
"We must do this now," he said about the company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "private online database" or POD.
This may include contact lists, list of tasks, calendars, music collections and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which is all available in one browser and simultaneously.
This personal online data collection only makes it possible for the user to choose who will access this information.
The company refers to it as "through data for the provision of personal powers".
According to John Bruce, the company's leader is the idea of Inrupt, that the company would acquire the skills of sources, processes and relevant skills, to help Solid make it available to all.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee's, Bruce, IBM's security platform, some of the developers who have been hired to work on the project under the contract, and a group of volunteers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google, whether to bring in a complete change if all of these business models are fully supported.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a post published on Wednesday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt is intended to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the quality and quality of the new website created on the basis of Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an impact on the debate on the independence of the network.
Even Inrupt will be the founder and director of the Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.

Bernard Vann: an open World War I in Victoria's wake-up memory record
During the first world war alone, Victoria, who was baptized in England, marked her home for 100 years.
Colonel Reverence Bernard Vann fought his goal on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellengles and Lehacourt.
But he spent four days listening to and not knowing that he had won the highest British military target.
He and his two sons opened the memorial disk on Saturday in Rushdenis Northamptonshire.
One of her sons, Michael Vann, said that it would be “generally symbolic, ” when the stone would open 100 years after the battle of old age.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann, on September 29, 1918, led his patrol over Canal de Saint-Quentini, "a very strong wave of japs and audiences."
Later, he rushed to the attacker and carried it on with the "great crowd" before he alone rushed to one audience and fell into three opposites.
Colonel Vanni killed a German soldier on October 4, 1918, when the war ended only a few months later.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's activities were "something I know I can never repeat, but for which I always remain grateful."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up behind a paramedic led by Brentwood's royal nephew.
Michael Vann said he has “very much to participate in this paradise” and added that “not many people’s location and support show that real gambling is being valued.”
MMA fans were all night looking at Bellator 206, but you saw only Pässa Peppat
Imagine that you've been over the night to see Bellator 206, but you don't see this background.
San Jose Mass included 13 fights, including six from the main map, and this was shown on the 5th floor of the United Kingdom.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mouss and Rory MacDonald were preparing to cross the border, the U.S. viewers left their mouths wide open, as the screen appeared in Pärsa Peppa.
Many have not been inspired by this, especially those who have remained in the grave for centuries to see this battle.
One fan described the shift in Twitter to children’s comics as “a lot of bad jokes. ”
"This is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. the content was no longer suitable and they were obliged to devote themselves to the programme of children," explained Dave Schwartz, former Vice-President of Bellatori on marketing and communication issues when it was asked about transport.
"The Peppa Bridge," yes.
President Scott Cooker said they were planning to work on their timetable to take more into account in the future with the observers of the United Kingdom.
"If I now think about the restoration, I think we can solve this problem in the future," said Coker.
"Even if there's 6 Sundays there in the morning, we can't do this before our birthday, which is their first day.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there was a lot of text going on and not all of them weren't friendly.
We tried to improve it, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't, it was the government rule.
I can let you know that next time it doesn't happen.
Instead of fighting six, we showed a reference - as we usually did - we tried to offer more to the fans and we just went over time.
It's a terrible situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew himself about sex as a "valueless"
Tom Daley, an Olympic leader, says that he grew up knowing that he was inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old man said he didn't understand until high school, that "no one's like him."
Sharing Lauren Laverne's 4th Radio in Desert Island Discs, she said she's talking about homophobic rights to give others hope.
Getting a child also changed his attitude toward the fight against Olympics, giving me the feeling that it is no longer so important.
You get the usual long-term delivery manager Kirsty Young had to take a few months off because of his illness.
On Laverne's first visit, Daley said he felt less valuable than others because he was not socially acceptable if you liked boys and girls.
He said: “To this day, I feel that I am worthless and that I am different, that I have the power and the power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "nothing" worth, and he didn't let others be disappointed when they finally found out about his sex.
A two-time proks-Olympics driver has become highly assessed as a leader of the LGBT campaign, using his appearance at the National Community Games this year in Australia to turn to stronger countries for the demilitarization of homosexuality.
He said he's talking about it because he's convinced that he can live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others.
Three times the world champion said that love for a man - American film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was met as a surprise."
Daley married 20 years ago with his old Oscar, but he said that there was never a problem between the ages.
"If you were so young," he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died less than three years later - so it was difficult to find the same old one who had experienced similar rise and fall.
A couple were born in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley saying his "all appearances" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning gold medals,” he said.
"But you know, there are a lot more important things than gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father didn't agree to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in a chair.
"I couldn't tell him that, Father, you can't sit in the chair, because at that time you are no longer," he said.
“I held her hand when she finished breathing, and only after she had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted that she was not victorious,” he said.
The following year, Daley won the Olympic Games in 2012 and won a pron.
“I just knew that it was what I had been dreaming of all my life – to cause home with the people before the Olympics, it is not a better feeling of it,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice - Heather Small's Proud - which helped him prepare the Olympics and still makes him a Canadian.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4th Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was removed on Saturday from Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47-day Ryder Cup game, but he needs to improve his form to avoid a successful competition.
Mickelson, who plays a record 12 times each year in the event of two years ago, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk as a casualty and four-ball game.
Instead of being in the middle, as he has often been for the United States, the winner divided his day into two days, being a cheerleader and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct shooter, not even at his career, is not suitable for 48 years, especially to play at the foot of the Le Golf National golf course, where the long karma race is constantly fighting the failed race.
And if it's not scary enough, Michaelson will stand up on Sunday, in his 1st battle, with the right British Opener, Francesco Molinary, who has joined the powerful beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all his four contests this week.
If the Americans, who are behind the 12 singles at the beginning of the game with four points, start immediately, Michaelson’s fight may be of great importance.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, but he did not have much to add.
“He fully understood his part of today, turned me over to the altar, put his hand around my nose and said he was ready for breakfast,” said Furyk in the annex.
“He’s very confident.
He's listening and he's given to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I saw you get stronger, but that's how it went, and we had to choose a course like that.
He wants to be out like everyone else."
Mickelson spends Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the greatest player in Ryder Cup games.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never responded to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 beats, 20 losses and seven weeks, but Furyk said that his location has given his wife an additional spirit.
"He's funny, funny, excited, he likes to have fun with people and he's just great in the room," he explained.
“I think that the young players had been against him this week for a long time, and it was wonderful to see that.
He's offering more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great prosperity can soon collapse
European captain Thomas Bjorn is aware of the experience that the great leadership position of Ryder Cup on the last day of the solo games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
At the 1997 public debate in Valderrama, with Captain Seve Ballesterose, the Danish authorities held five-point positions in front of the American classes, but over the finish line, it was dramatically reduced, which could only be achieved with a result of 141⁄2 : 131⁄2.
"Remember even that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brooklyn, where we lost and Valderrama, where we won, came a great victory," said Bjorn in the picture after Class of 2018 won 5 : 3 row and before 10:6 Le Golf Nationalis.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can repeat.
You're going to give the best of yourself tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over before you have points in your book.
We have the aim of fighting the sword and therefore we focus on it.
I've always said, I'm focusing on the 12 player who's on us, but we're very aware of who's our opponents -- the world's best players."
“ I’m not going to get ahead in things like this, ” Bjorn added.
It's a whole new challenge tomorrow.
Tomorrow they're reading personal stories and so it's really different.
It's good to be with the opponent if things go well, but if you're there personally, you'll be fully tested as a golf course.
It's a message you have to send to the players - give us the best tomorrow.
Now, if you leave your partner behind, he'll have to go and get himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will act personally better than with the opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received from four points three.
Furyk himself has experienced both during these last days, being part of the Brooklyn victory of the team before becoming a part of the losing part of the European war "Medinah's dream".
"I remember every cursed word," he replied in response to the question of how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all his games on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start tomorrow, like Brooklyn and like Medinah.
If the yoke goes one direction, it will bring great stress to the central competitions.
Let's set up our team and put the boys out in the way we know it's going to be a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been entrusted with the task of trying to lead the fight and he is the best to compete with Rory McIllroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Frame, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as well as the best Europeans in the fight.
"I put my boys in this order, because I think we're so well hidden," Bjorn said of his choice of solo games.
Germany's new military coup d'état again
In 2014, the German newest railway would have to be used in 2014 by replacing the old cold wartime zones, but this did not happen until the next year due to the damage to the systems and the costs of lumberjacking, the local media announced.
The use of the "Rheinland-Pfalzi" of the New Baden-Wuerttemberg class is now under way for the first half of 2019, in accordance with the historically published military press release of Die Zeit.
The vessel would have had to join the sea already in 2014, but the problems of the transition did not make this ambitious project easier.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships, which were ported to the sea in 2007, replace the old Bremen class shortcuts.
It is understandable that they have the power to fly, including aircraft and ships against, and some protective technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared and audio signals.
Other important options include longer periods of care - the latest speeds should be possible to get out of the house for up to two years.
However, lasting delays mean that more and more war zones - which allow Germany to strengthen foreign power - are already becoming an old age in the time of their arrival in the ministry.
The failed F125 route appeared in the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Bloom & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the ship was sent back to the shipowner after its arrival.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of important “drugs and raw materials” that changed the use of military equipment if they were used in the fight mission.
The lack of equipment was particularly important, since the Baden-Württemberg class was managed by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the old Bremen class's speedboats.
It also made it clear that the ship is significantly superior, which reduces its effectiveness and limits the ability of the sea to add future innovations.
The 7000 tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" is likely twice as difficult as the same class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the damage to the asset, the problem is also changing the cost of the entire project, including training of the team.
It is said that it extends to EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new speedy railways are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy is losing power.
At the beginning of the year, President Hans-Peter Bartel of the German Parliament's Committee of Defence acknowledged that the sea had actually "fished vessels".
The officer said that this theme had grown as the ship had been removed, but the ship had not arrived.
He expressed regret that no one from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could connect with the sea.
National Trust scans the fingerprinted secret
The purpose of the new study carried out in the coastal country is to show how skin rashes use the landscape to search for their food.
It is expected that the results will give new light to the conduct of these unique pilots and will help guide future protection measures.
A study by the National Trust scientists in Scotland is following the usual and sopranipipes of Inverwe's old home in West Rossi, as well as the red long-distance and Daubenton skin cancer.
Special storage holders shall be placed in the main locations of the area in order to monitor the activity of skin cramps throughout the whole period.
NHS workers and volunteers also carry out interim investigations using hand-held grants.
The competent assessment of all stocks shall determine the frequency and type of skin rashes.
Then there will be a map and a report of living places to create a detailed map of their behaviour.
NTS Nature Protection Officer Rob Dewar hopes that the results show which areas of life are the most important for skin cancers and how different species use them.
This information will help to identify the feasibility of managing habitats, such as the creation of species and the best way to keep forests for skinbirds and other species related to them.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the population of skin cancer has been significantly reduced in the last century.
They threaten the construction and development activities that affect their place of residence and its loss.
Fire turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as do the chemical processing of paper and certain construction materials, as well as attacks on pets.
It's not really dark.
But they are more useful than their eyes because of their braiding their tails.
They use complex foot-and-mouthing techniques to identify the gaps and obstacles on their aircraft project.
More than 270 historical buildings, 38 important lakes and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country are seriously affected by skin rashes.
They have ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, review, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even created the first and only special skin hygiene reserve in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of the ten skin types live in Scotland.
David Thompson says that this area is an ideal territory for them.
"Threave has a big area for hairdressing," he said.
“We have old houses, many old trees and a great place to live.
But there's still much to discover about skin cancer, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need."
It stresses the importance of controlling skin cancers prior to starting maintenance activities, as the undesired destruction of one pregnancy and childbirth site can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Skin cramps are protected and their killing, destruction or destruction is illegal.
Professor Elizabeth Ferrrell of the Association of Protective Associations, Scott, has urged the public to help.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our skin color, and we just don’t know how many of our species and their populations eat. ”
Ronaldo is going back to rape charges while the lawyers are planning to appeal to the German press
Cristian Ronaldo has rejected the charges of rape against him as a "debt," saying that people "proceed to advertise themselves", using his name.
His lawyers intend to prosecute charges issued by German historian Der Spiegel.
The attackers from Portugal and Juventus have been charged with violence against the American community with Kathryn Mayor in the Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
He has alleged to have paid EUR 330 643.10 on a female scale so that the difference would not be mentioned, reported Der Spiegel on the rules.
In a direct video of the Instagram’s 142 million followers after hearing charges, Ronaldo (33) was told that he was “indicted. ”
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's talk is false," said the winner of the Ballon d'Ori.
They want to advertise with my name.
It's normal.
They want my name to be heard, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player laughing.
According to the Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a complaint in the Der Spiegel case concerning "unauthorized suspicions concerning the absence of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for “a moral damage that corresponds to the difficulty of corruption, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The incident occurred in June 2009 in the village of Palms Hotel and Casino.
After a meeting at the club, Ronaldo and Mayor were alleged to have returned the player's hotel ticket where he claimed to have been raped in accordance with the documents provided by the Clarki District Court of Nevada.
The Mayor claimed that Ronaldo was born after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99 percent of a good man”, one percent of whom was “one percent lower. ”
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it wasn't alone.
Mayor also claims that he went to the police and took photos of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed with the court solution, because he feared "an award for the tax" and was concerned about "an official assignment".
Now a 34-year-old woman says she's trying to reverse the solution now because the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United during the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid this summer, and he took over 100 million euros of the Swiss Juve with respect to the Italian trade.
Brexit: The UN may start to hesitate to leave car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom "will do it forever," said business secretary Greg Clark, when he lost his position as head of the world's car industry after Brexit.
He added that the Toyota UN had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily cease to produce those living near Derby in Burnaston.
"Let's make a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of border crossings without the Brexit agreement could be paid to work.
In Burkina Faso, where vehicles are manufactured in Toyota Auris and Avenues, almost 150 000 cars were exported to the European Union last year.
"My opinion is that when Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see the end of the production process in its own hands," said Mr. Marvin Cooke, director of the work of Burnstone Toyota.
Other United Kingdom car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without agreement, feeling concerned about the operation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that the Mini plant in Oxford closes after a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the supply chain risks in the absence of the Brexit agreement.
The production line shall work in accordance with the need for spare parts from both the United Kingdom and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom departs from the EU without an agreement concluded on 29 March, there may be disturbances which, according to the industry, may cause delays and lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day's supply in its Derbyshire factory, so production should be stopped.
Clark said theresa May Chequersi's plan in relation to future EU relations is "suspendly calibrated to avoid such controls at the border."
"We can agree. We want the best solution, which will allow what we want, not just to use the current advantage, but to remove the whole opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4 to Today.
“The facts not only about Toyota, but also about other producers show that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain complex.”
Toyota was unable to say how long the production was to be stopped, but in a longer perspective, cautioned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the project and eventually pay for work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a representative of the Union for 24 years, said that his members are more concerned: “We know from our experience that when jobs fail, they will not come back.
The president of the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be interrupted again, says White House.
Donald Trumpi's meeting with the great opposition of chief prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can continue to be interrupted by another week, as the battle continues against the highest-ranking candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, announced on the Day of the Day of Atonement.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Rapporteur Robert Mueller, who is investigating the involvement of Russia's elections, the relationship between the Trompi and Russia and the possible obstacle to the rule of law by the President.
Whether Trump attacks the head prosecutor's agent and yet threatens Mueller's independence, he's been incinerated a few months ago by Washington.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using the above-mentioned instruments to preserve the negotiations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But on the first day of the first day, he went to the White House, informing him that he was planning to go back.
Instead, it was reported on the fourth day of the meeting with Trump, who was then in New York to the United Nations.
Trump said that he did not want to mislead Rosenstein, but then the meeting went on to avoid contact with the hearing of the Senate's hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave both of them recognitions.
On the basis of the findings made by Trump of a one-week FBI investigation against Kavanaugh, he proceeded with a motion for a resolution.
The corrupt president, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on the news channel Fox News.
When the aunt asked about her meeting with Rosenstein: “The date has not yet been determined, it may be this week, but it may be another week to go on, taking into account all that is going on with regard to the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep it in the media, as always."
Some journalists would argue that since September 10, the White House has not been held since the White House press conference.
You're gonna get Chris Wallace to ask why.
Sanders said that the delay of hours of information had not caused TV reporters to think of fraud, although he added: “I do not accept the fact that they have been prepared for corruption."
Then he recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President makes more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, without adding evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
Infotons continue, Sanders confirmed, but “if the paper has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot and you've seen how we've done it over the past few weeks, so it happens at the time of the press conference, if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions from White House when leaving or attending open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week New Yorks demonstrated the president, perhaps why, before meeting with the journalists on time and sometimes with a strange appearance.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU workers in the NHS Scotland concerning Brexit’s fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working in Scotland NHS in order to express thanks to the country and to recommend their follow-up to Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent his letter when I left the United Kingdom for less than six months after I left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already assumed the obligation to cover the costs associated with the status of EU citizens working in its public service.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Suvele has continued negotiations on the restoration of the United Kingdom and the EU, drawing attention to the decisions that it is expected to take.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom has also made preparations for the possible non-agreement scenario.
I know it's a very bad time for you.
That is why I wanted to repeat now how much I appreciate every worker's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Officials from all over the EU and others produce valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit our patients and communities.
It's your home, and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passed after a special section
Tennesse State Tiggers, a supporter of Christion Abercrombie, passed an extraordinary section after Saturday's main event and graduation 31: 27 Vanderbilt Commodes, published Tennesse Mike Organ.
Tenssee's chief of State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the accident occurred just before the half.
"He fell asleep and just fell together," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie a shot before she was placed in the candelamite for further review.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) said Abercrombie operation Vanderbilt Medical Center has finished.
Harris added that there is no details about the type/sustainment of the disease and Tennessee State is trying to explain where the disease occurred.
Abercrombie was his first time in Tennesse State after the Flood of Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he had five fights, which took 18 tours this time.
Foreigners must pay higher temple tax when buying their own goods in the United Kingdom
Foreigners must pay higher temple tax if they buy the property in the United Kingdom by using it to assist additional households on the basis of the new Tory plans
This step is damaging Corby's attempt to please young voters.
The temple tax shall be paid to those who do not pay in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will generate up to 120 million dollars a year to help households
Foreigners must pay a higher amount of temple tax if they buy a loan in the United Kingdom, using it to assist additional households, said Theresa May today.
The movement is to be tried to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to remind young voters of the permits to offer them a decent life and to target people with high incomes.
The temple tax shall be paid to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with a view to the Government's desire to fight against homelessness.
Addendum - which is in addition to this temple tax, including higher rates, established two years ago to another house and to purchases related to further training - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will generate up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s purchases belong to non-United Kingdom citizens who raise prices and make it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet down in the race for life.
Many of the powerful regions of the country, especially in the capital, have become 'crazy' thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
A new policy will only be achieved within a few weeks after Boris Johnson called on the temple tax to help young people fight their first home.
He blamed large construction companies for maintaining high prices of cash when they bought countries but did not use it, and he called on Mayd to abolish quotas for expensive homes to improve the "life-related damage" in Britain.
Corbyn has been informed of the reform of the multi-stakeholder economy, including the control of rent and the cessation of the dumping of people with condoms.
He also wants to give the authorities greater powers to build new homes.
“ Last year, ” said May, “I promised that I would dedicate my life to the restoration of the dream of Britt, that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our permanent standard of living.
Britain is always open to people who want to live here, work and build their own life here.
At the same time, it is true that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as businesses who live abroad, have the same ease of buying homes as working hard in the UK.
Too many people have become too far from home to their own homes, and harsh sleeping conditions are normal reality."
Jack Ross: "My top goal is to lead Scotland"
Superlan leader Jack Ross says his "excellent purpose" is to get a leader in Scotland at some point.
Schotlane (42) welcomes the challenge of restoring the North East Club, which is currently in the third place in League One, with only 3 points behind it.
He went to this summer stadium for the Stadium of Light after he had taken St. Mirreni back to the Coastal League in the past.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I came to Class B and that's the limit," said Ross BBC Scotland to the Sports Sound.
“As I grew up with my father, Shotimad in Hampden, and this is always something that has drawn me back.
But this opportunity only comes when I'm successful in running the club."
The Russian presidents of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paul Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletics says that he did not feel the fear of such great and known names, having previously accepted both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, it's time for me to be able to bring this club to the League of Masters."
Because of its structure and structures, this club belongs to the League of Masters," he said.
"Your arrival is not an easy task, but I see myself successful only if I succeed in getting the club back there."
Ross has only worked on the leadership for three years, in the former Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months of leadership staff.
Then he helped Allo recover from a third-level decline and changed to the lowest position in St. Mirreni's next mastering career.
And Ross says he feels comfortable right now when he was in his career in Clyde, Hartpool, Falkirk, St. Mirrenis and Hamilton Academy.
"To do was with a real cross," he recalled taking over Alloa.
“I really believed that management is more suitable for me than playing.
It looks like it's weird, because I got started, I got a smart entrance, and I enjoyed a few tips.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things to do every day.
I still experience the pain and stress of my work in the face, but the leadership just seems right.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and I'm feeling happy now than I used to be in an adult age."

The temperature has improved British emergency pipe walking, but the greater stress has been caused by restaurants.
The figures showed that the use of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA, developed these figures: “Sustainable participation in global tourism was similar to that in June when the pubs grew by 2.8 percent, apart from the fact that the restaurants were even more difficult.
In June, 1.8% of the downsizing of restaurants was still under way in July.
The main pubs and bars were the most successful and the most comfortable restaurants are to enjoy.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, although not both dramatic and restaurantlike.
Looks like people just wanted to go out.
There was a 6.6 per cent increase in the number of audiences and bars during the month, while food prices decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analysis of free time travel and hospitality, said: “These results continue to influence what we have seen since the end of April.
The effects of air and large social or sports events will remain a major factor if the domestic market is sold out.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although sales decreases by 4.8 per cent compared to last year are particularly welcome in addition to the price gap.
Long and hot summers would not have been possible for food businessmen and only time shows whether the moderate temperatures we have experienced in August give some necessary relief."
The increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown of the trade mark authorities.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitor in the United Kingdom's pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes the operating data of the 47 activities group, with a total of over 9 billion needles, and this has proved to be a comparability of the industry.

The new high school feared that sexual content would be postulated.
Twenty percent of the students said that they are both meant to be shown to the parents as well as to the “principal account” they would accept.

An American who won the Atlantic Olympic Games in 1996 in 200 metres and 400 metres together with four Olympics and now often shares his opinion with BBC, has not been able to walk after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote in Twitter: “I found a month behind bars.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I come back and when, in what extent, it's only time.
I've done a lot of work, but I've completely recovered, I've learned to walk again, and I've already done speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging words!"
The Internet is divided into two pieces by a woman's radio broadcast.
The company has shared the Internet with two leaves of advertising, compared to the beautiful mother’s shorts.
According to the case, to mark the “world’s first-class band” presentation, the technology company Elvie, directed to consumers, published a similar advertising on the IR video in order to present the freedom that this new pump offers to the mothers who want to live.
Four real mother dances with a song filled with tears and sings: "Yes, I laugh myself, but you don't see me dream" and "If you don't notice, they're not monsters, they're my cousins."
The psalm repeats: “Pup, pump, child, pump, pump, full of my honey."
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has generated similar opinions on the Internet.
Seventy-seven thousand times, and thousands of comments, video viewers are on a special note. Many of them say that it sheds light on the weather conditions of the silent industry.
‘The use of lead for advertising this product was a very difficult decision.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, but the difference is that children are stolen from them by the days they were born after birth," wrote one.
Elvie breast pump does not touch the eyes of the breast-feeding nurse (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “It is understandable that both mother and child are traumatized.
But why not use these children only to keep the mother-in-laws on advertising?
Someone's added: totally unsatisfied advertising."
One woman kept the story to the extreme.
"I think it's a genetic idea.
I'd buy myself if I still had lunch.
The milk pumping really made me feel totally bad.
The advertising is a little crazy, but we'll take it as it is.
It's a genetic product," wrote one.
Another comment: “It is fun for advertising (usually in their workplaces or in their drinking) and for mothers who are self - conscious.
This advertising does not support or condemn the silent industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they have all danced with non-smoker-smokered pumps.
The campaign's idea is based on the fact that many of the women who smoke in the country feel like they're getting drunk.
But Elvie Pump is completely tired, no leaders or tourists and does not look at the nursery, lets women move freely, keep the children and even go in the wind during the bombing.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such a innovative product that it is wrong to celebrate and distort knowledge.
In comparison with the opportunities for women to express themselves and the silent industry, we wanted to raise the wall and all its challenges, while presenting them in a pleasant and conscious manner, taking special enjoyment of freedom, which the new pump does.
It's not the first time the news's been hit by Elvie pump.
In the fall of London, a visual designer named Martha Jakubowski appeared to the two children's mothers.
Happy migrant children left on the Texas side of the teleclad
The number of children of detained migrants has increased rapidly, although any restrictions have remained quite the same. In part, due to the harsh rhetoric and policy of the Trump administrator, the situation has changed with the assistance of sponsors for the establishment of children.
Usually, most sponsors with the sponsors of documents and they are afraid to violate the possibility of continuing their country, which requires the child’s right to care.
At the beginning of June, the national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other households could be able to present the data to the competent authorities in question.
In the past week, the mayor, Matthew Albence, announced to Congress that the agency had arrested someone who asked for financial support from non-participated minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had not been convicted of a criminal offence.
"About 80 per cent of sponsors or sponsors live illegally in the country, and a large number of them are criminally involved.
So let's continue to follow them," said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the operation of children, officials adopted new rules requiring parts of these cases to appear within a month of detention.
Many defend their legal content in front of the domestic court by means of a video conference, immediately coming to the place.
Not suitable for release shall be sent out of the country immediately.
On the basis of the reports of the system published in the past months, the longer the child is infected, the more likely they are to become nervous or mutilated, which may cause violent mental or flight tests.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more current in large detention institutions, such as Tornillo, where children’s suffering can be reduced by the size of two eyes.
They added that raising children without the need to spend enough time with them or with friends can be a source of stress that many have already faced.
Syria demands immediate departure from the United States, France and Turkey
Foreign Minister of Syria Walid al-Moulam invited the United Nations Chief Assembly to come home to Syrian refugees, although the country has already been in the war for 20 years.
The Moulelem, also a deputy, said that foreign forces on the Syrian side were illegally opposed to the terrorist attack and were dealt with accordingly.
“They have to leave immediately and under conditions,” he said in Asamble.
Moulalem said that Syria's “war against terrorism is almost over.” Since 2011, more than 360 000 people have died and millions more have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue “to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and from “any illegal external force in this Holy War.”
In the United States of America, about 2000 are strong in Syria, mainly in training and recommending units of both Kurds and Syria's war against President Bashar al-Assad.
In France, more than 1,000 people have been killed in the war.
Speaking on the subject of war refugees, Moulalem said that the conditions of their recovery were appropriate and he blamed the incomprehensible fears that prevent the outcome of the refugees from spreading part of the West.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them find them," he said.
"They're policying something that's just a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given a reimbursable agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which is based on the latest support point for the cleansing of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue with political talks.
The Vienna-Turkey Agreement has maintained a wide range of Russian forces supporting Russia's forces in the province of three million people.
However, Moulalem stressed that the contract was “explained times” and expressed the hope that military action would strike the Japanese soldiers, including the Nursra Front of Al-Qaeda, who “will be destroyed”.
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura is looking forward to welcoming new committees composed of members of the government and opposition to the first meetings to plan for the post-Syria military constitution and send you to the election.
Moulam submitted requests for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to the review of the articles of the present Constitution and warned of intervention.
Why is Trump also selected as the second official
According to this logic, Trump could win the following elections in 2020 if the withdrawal of the office and the scandal had not already ended its presidential commission, as would be expected by liberal observers.
There is no doubt that "the most exciting end of the presidency!"
At present, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, there have been two-fold ratings in CNN over 1.05 million and almost 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to the legend, Fox New has averaged 2.4 million viewers. Compared to 1.7 million viewers of four years of age, the number of them has risen. MSNBC is available through the "The Rachel Maddow Show" 3.5 million cable viewers have kept this rating high during the first few nights.
"This is the burden we have to bear, because we do not understand it," said the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" on the Secretary of State, who will get the president when the robbery destroys Parliament Hall.

"Why?" she asked.
"He said he'd call me laugh," said Mrs. Scowell to me.
All of this has a pleasant value.
Of course, not as much as any other television shows, Washington's members may be able to be sent to the future of Roe v. Wade and reunite to the families and to the global economy.

He couldn't wait to see how Brett Kavanaugh should be taking action in the Senate's legal committee and how the Supreme Court's trial was brought to an end.
"I remember how we did every crazy thing in our time and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said to me.

Other moving cash flows into the latest White House exchange
It is not surprising that the 17th region of Pennsylvania will be reorganised thanks to the reorganisation of the congressional region by getting two market-led entrepreneurs from the same location.
Thanks to this, the Authority again voted in favour of the Pitsburg Region, a representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Lamb, who won a position in the other region in the previous few special elections.
The Lamb's anti-scandidate is the Liberal Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented in the 12th region of Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the new 17th.
The cards were amended after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, so the old regions were divided into the electoral districts against the rule of law, in favour of the Republic.
The new 17 elections have already saved the campaign, with the financial sectors of the largest departments of the region - the Committee for Congress of Democrats (DCCC) and the International Committee of the Classes (NCRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania as a winner of many of the March 18 special elections in the Pennsylvania 18th Congressional district.
This has been the case for several decades, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the region.
Political thinkers have given the Democrats a small advantage.
USA El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then returned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a small return to Washington.
Mr. Trump's meeting in June 2017 in a friendly atmosphere in Panama's president Juan Carlos Varelaga and in his own Panama hotel until partners pulled Trumpi out of the company's management team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to call the leaders of a diplomatic mission from the United States, as Prime Minister Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries were no longer supported by Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador, who received $140 million from the US in 2017, would be punished for the monitoring, development and economic growth of drugs.
The penalties proposed, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been valid for the Central American country and its high employment and for the number of deaths.
During the internal meetings, the North American and Central American officials continued to pursue a high level of demand, aimed at security and economic justice, in order to continue to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen in the development efforts to prevent cross-border movements in the United States.
But in mid-September, the high officials explained that they wanted to continue the investigation and to conclude any discussion about El Salvador's crimes.
According to the diplomats, it is now calculated by Vice-President Mike Pence, who is speaking in mid-October on demand to speak about the Government's positions.
And three American envoys were born secretaries of El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without news or punishments for the war of Washington.
The President of the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions on the requirement of anonymity.
Their discussions confirmed the government's close analysis, which also referred to the requirements for anonymity.

What do we do when Trump's attorney's assistant director, Rod Rosenstein, controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the middle of the water since it was reported that he made a proposal to keep the President's secret last year and revealed to that officer his disagreement.
Rosenstein says The Times's statement is invalid.

Rangers' Graham Dorrans on Rapid Vienna's battle is optimistic
Rangers will arrange for Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that you will be able to overcome Australia, which, at the beginning of this month, won a memorable victory against the Villarreal in Spain, they will take a strong position to get a Group of the European Union G.
The firefighting did not allow middleman Graham Dorrans to first appear before 2:2 a week before the game ended against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers will be able to use this result as a hopper to achieve better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is strong against," said 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game, believing that we could get something and left the game with the point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but in general it was the right result.
They were better on the first half of the game and on the second half of us again.
Thursday may be another big and important evening for Europe.
Hopefully we get three points, but it can be a hard game because they have a good outcome in their last game, but because the people support us, I'm sure we can get together and get good results.
The last year was difficult, thanks to this, I was injured and the changes in the club, but now we all feel good inside.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.

Women can't sleep because of the fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the participants in the debate had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were talking to their husbands about the long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said she talked to her children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't speak on this subject," explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Insurance Activities of the Nationwide.
But that should start.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare for your family if they do not know what you want before.
Work with your consultant and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these choices may be very important with regard to costs.
Keep advice with your financial adviser: Your consultant may have a good plan to pay for their costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid financial security policy to help cover these costs, or an early self-reliance - as long as you have a requirement.
Prepare your legal documents: Skip all possible legal battles already.
Don’t worry about the list of health services to identify a reliable person who will follow your doctor’s help and ensure that specialists will follow your wishes when you cannot contact yourself.

Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your mother is in a medical emergency and she is on her way to the hospital.

NYC requests federal prosecutors for a suspected death warrant
New York federal prosecutors are asking for a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of being a terrorist in New York where eight people were killed. This short sentence has not been applied since 1953 for federal crime.
Saipov (30) reportedly used Home Depot's racing cars to attack the railways across West Side's mountains in Alam-Manhattan, in October, as well as the railways.
According to the applications for a death sentence in the New York Southern Region, prosecutors must prove that Saipov had killed eight victims willingly and also had serious health problems.
In both cases, there is a possible death penalty on the basis of the court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal prosecutors all filed a 22-point charge against Saipov, which included two murder charges, together with the excavation, which are generally used by federal prosecutors in organised criminal proceedings, and the prosecution of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
Rünnak predicted "the planning and prevention of the animals," the prosecutors said, describing the Saipov activity as "suspending, waving and waving."
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and injuries to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco's family and friends," states the report.
Five victims were Argentina's tourists.
Ten years have passed since the last death penalty in the New York Southern Region.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but as a result, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was performed in New York in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a federal court where a couple were guilty of committing a crime in order to make a petition for a period of two years before the Council approved the Cold War.
Both Rosenberged on the electric train on June 19, 1953.
As a result, the court documents showed a lack of concern over the following days and months of the attack.
The police said he told the investigators that he had been made with a good mind.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack to take the ISIS videos from his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted the release of the ISI contract in his hospital.
In the 22nd sentence, he has not taken the guilt.
David Patton, a Saipov national defender, said that they have been ‘ clearly deceived. ’
“In our view, the decision to apply for a death sentence will extend the guilt without the possibility of being released from prison for a long time instead of the trauma of all the perpetrators of the matter,” said Patton.
In the past, Saipov was asked not to apply for a death sentence on prosecutors.
In the words of the Tory Member of Parliament, NIGEL Farage should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage agreed today's Tory Conference "to mobilize people's arms".
The former leader of the UKIP said that politicians had to "know the anger" of the Eurosceptics because one of the members of his own parliament recommended that they take the lead in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative subcontractor Peter Bone said in Berlin in March that the UK would "be already out" if Mr Farage would be a Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May is facing a problem with her deeply rooted routing, which stressed the survival of conservatives, joining the city with her protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is in dire need of maintaining its Chequers plan between Brexit supporters, residents and EU attacks.
The Union requested that he continue to work with Brussels despite the opposition and to choose Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose their package and the ‘caose’.
Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihullis that he wanted to "get rid of Chequersi's plan".
He suggested taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'In his responsibility, we'd be out now,' he said.
A member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I stand outside of Brexit, but we have to quit the Chequers plan."
Commenting on his answer, he said: “We have not fought in the world in order to be free.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonne rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has now changed since the 2016 vote: “The view that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Tory Brexit’s assistant, Andrea Jenkyns, was also in March and told the reporters: “I have only one: Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers' plan is a general public stand, the opposition does not vote, it is a non-popular one in our territory and in the presence of our activists who actually go through today and choose us as a whole.
Please keep the Chequer's plan and try to listen."
In his letter to May, he added: “Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises. ”

In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to introduce our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit.
"We have mobilized the nation's capital, which has given us the victory over Brexit, and we are not cleansed before we have reached the sovereign, sovereign, threat of Great Britain."

“The action is complete.
"There's no such thing as good Brexit," he added.

Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton comes to the world's capital after the military account gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From this point on, it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, Lewis Hamilton, before the Mercedes team's organization played a major role.
Bottas got a good start and left Hamilton almost alone when he first defended his position and invited Vettle to attack her husband.
The streams went to the top of the box and left the Hamilton group behind to a close movement that should have been decided.
In Mercedes, he went to the boxing room later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went after the accident when Ferrari's leader left his mind free to cross the interior after the third round of his attempt to protect this double movement.
Max Verstappen started a fight on the back of a wheelchair and was at the end of the first round for his 21-year-old birthday.
He then led the fight for most of the time, drove the bombs off the green finish line and passed through the Kim Räikkönen, taking four places.
He finally drove to boxing in the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which would lead to the 4th place of Räikkönen.
Today is a hard day because Valtter has been working hard all week, and he was a real gentleman to pass me through the children.
"The team has done great work to make them one of two," said Hamilton.
It was a very strong body.
President Donald Trump asked Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday because of his attempt not to play Christine Blasey Fordi's book, where he was charged with sexual harassment by the Supreme Court named Brett Kavanaugh'd.
At the meeting of the West Virginia, the President did not address the fact that Fordi had been given a standing before the Commission, but instead he commented on what was happening at the time of the Senate, which shows that people are “false, liars and liars”.
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate for a few days is that you see hate and hatred, lies, lies, lies and lies people," he said.
“When you look at the prints and the pictures that you say: “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you move?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you play a document?” – “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't move."
Wait a minute.
Did we play ... no, we didn't play," he added with the senator's voice.
Ford sent a letter to Féinstein about the crimes committed at Kavanaugh, and it was released in early September, but Féinstein refused to leave his office.
The Hill reported: "I didn't hide Dr. Fordi's crimes or interfere with his story," said the Feinstein Committee.
“He asked me to keep confidentiality, and according to his prayer I did it.”
But his refusal did not fit in with the president, who commented at the Saturday meeting: “You know what it was like to be a very strong body.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
By continuing to protect a high-ranking candidate who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President regrets that the democracies are using these charges on an ongoing basis.
“They have decided to take the power back to choose the means.
They don't care who they're hurting, they need to drive over to get power and leadership," the Media President said.

Micronesia airport failure: Air Niugin airport claims that one man has lost his airport after the launch
Although it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the airport, the airline now claims that one man has been missing in Micronesia.
Air Niugin said in his statement that since the Saturday afternoon, they have not been able to find a monthly traveler.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find a man.
The carrier did not immediately respond to the passenger's details, such as his age and nationality issues.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the flight to Chuuki Island when the water was sinking.
The officers said they had seven people taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their position was stable.
The circumstances and precise events of happiness are still unclear.
Both the airlines and the U.S. Marines said that the aircraft landed far from the airport.
A witness thought the plane was flying over the plane.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was driving very low on land.
"That's very good," answered Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to hide on a deep plane in a network of water through the air.
He mentioned that the rescuer was in pain and pain and that he had a small headache.
The United States of America’s seamen and seamen, who had been working on a nearby river, also helped to rescue, using a full - distance boat to reach people’s shores before the plane was about 30 metres below water.
The flight safety network data show that 111 people have died during the last two decades in airport accidents with PNG registered airlines, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analytics form a temporary night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the Court of Justice terminated its review of the husband who was charged with burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours as an expert in the analysis of reading data.
He brought out to the guards how he used the phone calls to return to the 29-year-old prosecutor Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers's movement on the night they died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlet said he received a number of phone information that showed that Tellis was with Chamber that night when a new man died, which was opposed to the previous claims of a young man.
When the data showed that he was with Chamber, the young man himself claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so he went to talk to the police officer Sanford.
Sanford stood in court on Saturday and admitted that he wasn't in town that day.
When the criminals asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis was "false because my car was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he had heard from Chamber before he died about two weeks ago.
The phone calls showed that they only knew each other in a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, Tellis removed his phone from Chambers' messages, calls and contact information.
"He removed his new life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to do its judgment on Sunday.
The judge said he thought your case was going to be the last half of the day to talk to the guards.

The New York Child Carer is calling for a racist message after a couple of trials
The New York Child Carer claims that the divorce is discriminatory after a couple of unheard-of-the-family messages where the mother used to say that the Child Carer is "the next black person".
The couple don't think they're racist compared to the pressure.
Two children’s mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her regret when she learned that their new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was blackmailed when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
Plasto-Flaxman wrote to his wife, saying: “IIIIII, JERJEKORDNE MUSTANHALINE.”
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to New York Post, after his professor's understanding of Plato-Flaxman's disability, Mrs. Maurice said that their sociologist, who was an Afro-American, had done bad work and he had been waiting for him for the Philippines.
Miss Maurice paid for one working day and then sent her home with Uber.
Now Maurice complains to a couple of court cases to get compensation for the cancellation, which she wants to receive in the amount of $350 a day in the next six months, and the same work she initially paid, but without contract.
“I want to show them how to look, so to do,” he said to the newspaper The Post, adding, “I know it is discrimination.”
A few have declined to claim that they are racist, saying that ending their working relationship with Maurice was a reasonable thing because they feared that they could no longer trust him after the divorce.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t think about.
He's not a racist.
"We are not racist," said Joel Plasco's wife to The Post.
“But would you allow your children to care for the person you were uncomfortable with, even if it was unwanted?
You're your own opponent?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison with the pressure, Plasco said that his wife was born two months after the birth of the child and was “very troubled. ”
“Would you go against someone like that?
It's not very nice now," the investment bank added.
Although the case continues, the public opinion has quickly come to the attention of a few in the social media, where they are widely considered as a result of their conduct and thinking.
The new book shows that Paddington's writers feared that readers wouldn't be able to communicate with the dog they were talking to.
Bondi’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the Bible’s adoption, wrote: “It’s difficult to put yourself in the hands of a person who read it for the first time.
It's really fun to know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He said that his father, having been inspired to write a book on a small playbook, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic after his work had been cancelled, and added that the 60th day of the publication was with the gunman due to his father's death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who described as “a very important member of our family, ” he added that his father was, however, a threat to his ultimate success.
"He was a very weak man and was not a threatening man," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was just as if your child was getting something: you're afraid of them, though it's not your achievement directly.
I think he looked at Paddington in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to leave with her on the phone.
On the ground, he took his daughter to Nice's hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked hard to save her life.
"They called regularly to say that the girl's position was very bad and that they don't believe she's going to live," said Mr. Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I got a call from Nad, who said my daughter is dying in two minutes, and I have to go with her.
And I did it.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medications that doctors gave him to break his heart had begun to disappear and to leave his body.
He was a little before he died and now started to stop all systems.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what's going on.
I couldn't escape, hurt or hurt because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperous, who now lost his daughter, went to the airport with other passengers who did not know anything about her experiences.
"No one knew that," he said.
“I kept my heads on the ground and the whites rolled all that time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible feeling against Nadi on this plane.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Leinova's postcards prevent suicide
Two women who lost their lovely self - control work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have stuck to Walles' cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Dr. Davis' son Tyler was 13, when he was suffering from depression, and when he was 18, he killed himself.
“I don’t want anyone older to feel what I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Dr. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a very busy cook who had a loud laugh.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile would put the whole room under control."
Despite this, he ended before his death because he was “in a very bad place with people."
In 2014, Tyler, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mr. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that it has a dominant effect."
Dr. Davis broke these cards “to let people know that there are people who turn around and even talk to their friends.
Don't be silly, you have to talk."
Dr. Humphrey, who had been a friend of Dr. Davis for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he would feel bad or be depressed or anything," he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before the rain.
He was in his lowest point during the first Christmas season — when the children opened their own kitchen, he had no eyes with them or anything."
Dr. Humphreys said that the death of a man was a terrible tragedy for them, but they have to do it: “It takes the whole family together.
It sucks on us.
But we must continue to go on and continue fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future shrinks in the direction of hair cancer, while the FBI's starting the investigation
“I believed that if we could actually get something that he wanted – limited time and extensive research – we could possibly achieve unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would “kill together” the permanent superiority of the parties.
Why didn't you want Mr. Kavanaugh and his liberal classes to help the FBI investigate this?
Their response was from time to time.
Interventions are the last five weeks after 6 November. If the liberal classes are not going well, they are obviously weakened in their plans to get the man they want to be in the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators, working hard to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bushi's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place on the Senate, where there are currently 51 Liberals and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to vote at least 50 in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to vote in a decisive voice and confirm the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh.
The number of North-Korean bats "requires" under Kim's government
South Korea's legislation has said that the number of North Korean bats in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong's seven years back in power.
Park Byeong-Seug, citing data from the Ministry of Justice of South Korea, said that in comparison with the 2011 alone (2706) they had decreased in previous year (1127).
Mr. Park said that the main pillars were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of human consumers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
A large number of North Korean citizens have been offered the citizenship of South Korea.
According to the newspaper Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the Korean border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has a longer state border with North Korea and which is easier to pass than a highly protected demilitarized area between two Koreas.
China will take refugees more than illegal immigrants and will often send them back to their homeland.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are still in the war, have been significantly improved over the past six months.
At the beginning of this month, two heads of state in Pyongyang met to hold negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trumpi and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work on a global nuclear power plant in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, R Yong-ho, condemned the US for lack of progress in sanctions.
"In spite of the United States, our country lacks security and in such circumstances we have no agreement to make ourselves the first weapon," Mr. Ri said in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kavanaugh's "hysterical" and said that a man is a judge of the Supreme Court
The president of the opposition, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court's candidate Brett Kavanaugh's "hüsteer" and said that a man is unable to serve as a Supreme Court Judge.
He published an opinion at a Saturday interview in Texas Austin at the Texas Tribune Festival in Texas.
"I did not notice that if a woman had been in such a way, she would have been called hysterical," Pelos said about her reaction, which was missing on the fourth day of the certificate given to the Senate Legal Committee.
Kavanaugh was emotionally charged that he was sexually attacked by Dr. Christine Blasey Fordi when both of them were court-martial.
Kavanaugh was a very emotional, family and high school student in his opening remarks, describing him in almost every instance of pain and became a voice.
He also clearly understood the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee, referring to the charges brought against him by Hillary Clinton for the loss of presidential elections in 2016 as a "grassy and coordinated memorial".
He believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man does not fit to be a judge of the Supreme Court because it showed that he was accused of democracies.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with their excuses and how he attacks Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
The game was rehabilitated when the aunt was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh back from her office if the democracies were to get most of the Essenes.
“I say so much – if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only a judge of the Supreme Court, but he does not fit in the trial where he is currently working,” said Pelos.
Kavanaugh is now a court of appeal in the province of Colombia.
In addition, he was afraid that democracy was concerned about the possible Affordable Care Act or the decision of Roe v. Wade (the legal representative of the office) after the decision of the translator, since he was considered to be a conservative judge.
In his statement, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time when a suspected hysterical person may be found to be a judge and wait for us to say that it is not good," Pelos said.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair word, six-and-a-half-year-long anger, and he won't get away with it.
"We wake up when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's impossible, do I?"
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was a leader; she said that she also used when she got angry, but she developed a method that stood out to get angry and screamed, so she cried to the person she would say, “You may think I’m drunk, because I’m sick.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was genius."
Pisares are partially accepted as an extract because they are interpreted as fundamentally wrong.
One of my best memories is of one of the old men at the office with most of the old men at the office where I found myself once unwritten in the cancer, as one older woman – a hard leader who was always a little scared – I was in the middle of a rock and a crack in the water.
"Never show them how to laugh," he said to me.
“They don’t know that you’re a marmot.
They think you're sick and it gives them peace."
Patricia Schroeder, the great Democratic Party Congress of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart, a male presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart remained on the left side of Monkey Business on the left side of a marriage romance and ended the campaign, he was deeply disturbed by the fact that there was no reason why he should not think of the presidential candidate himself.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," he said to me in tears 30 years later.
"The candidate's only seven candidates and the last thing they needed was someone else to join."
Someone said it's like "Lumlight and your seven-year-olds."
As the campaign was over, he was late in his collection, and he promised he wouldn't be a candidate if he couldn't get two million dollars.
It was a war of hope.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave the men $1,000, gave him the least of $250.
"Do they think I get pleasure?" he thought.
When he kept talking where he knew that he was not going to launch an official campaign, he felt — thanks to the people who supported him — the hostility against the system that made it difficult for the money collection and the delegates to return to the voters and hate sexism — to win him so that he became a little bitch.
"You should have thought I got a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder's press reaction to him.
“I could have thought Kleneex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they're writing to my boyfriend.
"Is he hungry?"
How the US-China Trade Force can be useful to Beijing
The open arms of trade between the US and China were cruel, and although the war is not far away, the national divide between the experts may be useful to Beijing in a long-term perspective.
President Donald Trump of the United States made the first safeguard solution this year by establishing important taxes on Chinese exports, including solar panels, steels and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs that cover the value of 200 billion dollars (150 billion yen) in the value of the product, by establishing internal charges for goods arriving in China from the United States.
Peking has always responded to each other, visiting the last $60 billion worth of between five and ten per cent tariffs for American goods.
China has led the US to respond to the challenge, and the world's second economy is probably not that fast.
Getting back to Washington would mean monitoring of claims, but publicly conserving Chinese President Xi Jinping would be too difficult.
However, experts claim that when Beijing leaves its cards correctly, trade forces with the US may support China in a long-term perspective by reducing the contrast between the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing may create conditions that cause the loss of control in another country is actually much more dangerous than the observers have already realized," said the author Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asia's research on the Center for New American Security.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Syria is ready for the return of refugees
In Syria, the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is praying for more than seven years after the war to re-establish the country.
In his speech to the United Nations Chief Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said that the situation in the country would improve.
"The situation in the territory of the country is more stable and safer thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government will continue to restore normality in order to restore the damaged areas of the terrorists.
There are now all the conditions that refugees who have left the country for the purpose of terrorism and who have been affected by daily life and livelihood could freely return to the country.
According to the United Nations estimates, 5.5 million Syrian refugees have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would take good care of the aid for the construction of the newly created country.
At the same time, he stressed that the State would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the resumption.
The victory of Ryder's career in Paris in Europe
The European team won Ryder's career in 2018 by attacking France, near Le Golf National, in the U.S. Golfi, France, at the end of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on the surface of Europe and has not won Ryder's career in Europe since 1993.
The European crown was restored when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team received 14.5 points for the United States to win.
During the entire tournament, the U.S. leader Phil Mickelson, who had been in the kitchen, turned on a 16-range train, creating a victory for Francesco Molinary.
The Italian golf course of Molinari was held in all its ranks by one of the four players who have won the tournament in 1979.
As a result, the American class, Jordan Spiechen, managed to avoid the Italian Thorbjorn Olesen, who was at the foot of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, was presented with 2 and 1 English Ian Poulter, to whom this Ryder's career training could last.
Eight of Ryder's veterans of career training, from the Spanish village of Sergio Garcia, received the Europlanetary, which won the most time in the fight against war with the 25.5 point of career.
“I don’t usually smoke, but today I can’t keep myself back.
It's been a hard year.
I'm grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be back home.
It's a masculinity, and I'm glad I got help," said emotional Garcia after the European battle.
He's giving a bullet to his co-founder Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
"I feel a special feeling of winning Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four trains in France and now wrote to him a career career leader Ryder's result 13 : 21 : 3.
A funny statistics for one of the best players of all time who've won the 14 grand anniversary title, leaving only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was in the middle of the week with the discovery of fiefways; the exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at the top of the golf course throughout the whole tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furyk, after the husband’s misconduct, said: “I’m proud of the guests, they were heartbroken.
There was a moment in the morning when we announced the distress to the Europeans.
We made it with them.
I'm afraid there's Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did very good work.
Let's get together, work together with the American PGA and our Ryder Police Committee, and move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to get some rest.
We played better."
