If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any length:
Green: Mariupol - heart of war, cease to fight - we will have weak positions
President Volodimir Zelenskiy believes that the wars in eastern Ukraine and in particular in Mariupol will determine the causes of war – and if the U.S. troops are able to escape there, the Russians can leave negotiations and buy over and over again the occupied territories.
It says, "Mariopol is this, you know, the heart of this war today.
It's happening -- we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have a weaker position.
They are the people who drew a large number of enemies to themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be on the east side of the state, in the (areas) of the OOS, and if they are stronger, the more we are closer to the stage of the debate, and we will have priority in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may not expect to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to return even to the cities we have now purchased.
They can go on and on.
Then our situation in the debate will be weaker and perhaps not even interested in the Russian side.
I'm sorry, we'll find out.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory...."
Details: Zelenski also said that it would be difficult to get to the negotiations after the raids of the Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity to make a diplomatic decision if they are with us."
It says, "People will get peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
In our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something, and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any of the conditions.
But if we are not emotionally speaking, war must end in peace, or millions of victims will be killed.
And even where millions of victims come to the end of war.
Yes, we must fight — but for life.
You can't fight for the chicken, when there's nothing left, there's no people."

The code to use for food
The chief administration of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine's intelligence has published a list of Russian military personnel involved in the shooting of military criminals in the village of Kiev.
According to Ukraine, this is what the Ministry of Defence reports at Facebook.
"A thief must know their names!
MY Ukraine has received a list of 64 military personnel from a separate motorbike Brigadier, who participate directly in the shooting of military crimes against the Ukrainian people in M. Buch,” says the report.
IN THE MOU, the U.S. Army notes that due to the crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought before the court and brought to justice.
The list can be viewed by connecting.
As reported by Ukraine, Irpine, Buch, Hostemel, and all the areas of Kiev were set free from Russian mines.
In the free cities and villages, mass killings have been committed by Russian civilians.
On April 1, the city head of Buchi Anatolia Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in the brotherly tombs.
Prosecutor General Irina Venedictova stated that on 3 April, 410 corpses of civilians were brought out of the Russian warheads of the Kiev area.
On February 24th, Russia’s president declared the beginning of a full - scale invasion in Ukraine.
Russian dignitaries shoot and destroy key infrastructures, create massive fires in the lives of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, reactive fire systems, ballistic rockets, avobombs.

Most of my well - known news reports of the civil unrest in the north of Kiev are shocking.
The photos of wounded and shots have ruined the entire civilized world.
Ten people ask each other how this could happen in the 21st century?
It's just what I'm feeling and I'm waiting for...
I brought out children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
And then a girl's colleague with children, and then she just came back to work.
Since 2014, I have been helping the U.S. and I have no doubt that in the event of the occupation of Kiev, my family will not survive.
Because it was and I was absolutely sure that the essence of the communo-CDBist regime had remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, he just can't exist, he's built on terror.
In 1937, one of my ancestors was shot in the prison in the city of Jitomir.
A few years ago, in the U.S.A., the U.S. had been able to remove a copy from the explosives of the propaganda: the whole thing was over a hundred pages, and the resulting loss was very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was unwritten, and I refused.
The ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor "one-way" path, never walking in the steps.
The fact that they lived on the shorts and had a few cows was enough to feed the young children and the elderly.
The parents did not even know where to hide.
My grandfather said that about a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all except two who agreed to give a false witness.
There's an old man named Sharia.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I don't wonder if his family was the CDB's informant.
As far as we know, apple apples fall...
The three - horned trio that attracted the village’s attention were ethnic Russians.
An analysis of the issue of prodition was made of various information resources.
There's a lot of great (unsatisfied) information resources on the "Undead Eye" call that clearly reminds us of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern - day Russia, NCWDists have found ways to punish and destroy almost all who have seriously investigated the crimes of their predecessors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass victims of Stalin’s repression were able to write the names of the killers, the system began to disintegrate, and then it was destroyed.
Apparently on the computer, they found files with child pornography, put them in jail, and died soon.
The KGB are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?
It focuses on the most complex characteristics of human nature.
Over a thousand years of Ordinian tradition has been devoted to slavery and imperialism in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then, over what happened, they've done a fascinating genetic experiment, inventing intelligence during a few minutes of red terror.
Look at a South-French film "Chékist" in 1992, that's all.
Why did you see my photo in the bathroom?
Can you ask the wife what I can buy from the cup?
I'm sorry I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids went, because Gala can't mean them.
Do you want Igor to ask you to go tomorrow manually? (He's out and can go, because today's car has not been seen at the station.)
We don't care so much about you.
You are very helpful, thank you!

When girls come back from school, what do they do then?
We came to the place where we moved from the center to the yard, the conditions were good.
But it's big but there's men living like drinking alcohol and smoking in the room, the sound of music is minimally what "sudden," the smell of cigarettes drunk to men and we're with the kids... they're afraid to sleep if they're honest.
Please help with the house, please, for the money.
But where it'll be safe and not cooked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room like that, something here they smell directly.
I beg you very much, one of them slowly stands on his feet, and something screams that he doesn't like.

And I have this problem, if I don't love a man, he won't come out.
Yes, we took the house and took the aunts away right away.
She was so grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help your customers.
The tears were in her eyes.
She said if it might still be an old box and a shower.
But it's not mandatory, only if it is.
I'm sorry it was him.
Before him my best friend was killed.

I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to leave and you made the meetings.
That's right, but we're not going anywhere and we don't know where it's going. We're looking for an hour and we're back on the tracks.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote me.
Is your father able to communicate only with Russian or with a family?
Children can come to Vali and play in the woods

After the stay, she talked to Volodymir about whether to wait for me until she found out if she was looking for me.
Because of the little one, I'm going to break the barrier.

But I can't call him because I ended up in a bank account.
I can't fill the phone because I don't understand either in a Czech online banker and it's not in a Ukrainian bank card.

Lydia's been admitted to school, but we're going to go to the teacher's neighborhood because we're sick.
I sit down, I keep my ears up, I listen to music and I think about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm going to put it this way that we're together.
I'd say there's gonna be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I have a lot of skills.
So I'm not afraid I didn't find any of them.
I just don't know how to live.

Write a Czech address, see the map where this is from.
I don't know how much space there is, so I can't plan with furniture this week to finally look at that room and then understand what furniture I need.
I'm sorry it's been a long, hard day to adapt.
That's enough?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, have such a chance to fight you.

Ole of the disease--the nose and the chest, better not take it with you to us, so that I don't get infected
I'm just going to be a little bit later -- something like 8, okay?
I don't want to misunderstand you.
Because I'm going through it so it's all right!
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excrasties!
I understand how important it is for you!
And I'm talking about myself (for me it's just a surface that doesn't reach)!
How do you feel today?
Hey, sorry, I just broke up, bad sleep.
I'm sorry I'm worried.
I was surprised that yesterday we had a bad time with Cole and I began to translate the test.
I would ask Gregory Denisenka or perhaps Yoonashek) to help me with my mathematical understanding for a while.
Can I and I be useful?
If that's possible, I want to support mathematical terms on the way out.
The geometry is quite complex, but we have to work with Cole to make it perfect.
Thank you for your testimonial
We're looking forward to that too.
And that's how she likes any gift.
Jacob wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech number
Last night, at the end of 402 buses, I met the Ukrainian Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay awake.
Now we agreed to get married.
And yesterday night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine who felt my heart involved.

I said I'd order a backup card.
No, I'm just a man.
So she didn't worry anyone came.
I didn't go.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
A year ago at the Memorial Center of the Holocaust, Babin Yar, in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yaro.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of State, which was also the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their ways and lives in territorial integrity, peace and security Europe.
This is also part of our responsibility, which is related to our history."
"If the demons of the past appear today in a new suit," he said, "then for us, Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must continue."
Today, Russia attacks a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of peaceful people, destroys the hunger of its inhabitants, and kills them from disease.
The Russian army is engaged in mass shootings by the Ukrainians, and this is clearly a reminder of the bombings in Babin Yaro.
More than a month Germans see it in the news in real-time mode.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, gives humanitarian aid, and weapons that have not been able to imagine so long.
The Germans are responsible for the heavy arms supply needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not just to speak against the swastika.
This means fighting all possible weapons of mass murder, genocide, war crimes, and wild animals.
There is no easy way out of risk and sacrifice to conquer evil and stop wild animals that are happening in Ukraine.
One of your songs tonight
We agree, discuss the trip, and write when we are in the congregation
All the patients except Lydia didn't get sick there was a new micron.

Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a long-term perspective
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Koreans were opposed to NATO entry and only 18% of the respondents said "after".
After the Revolution, Victor Yanukovich, the Crimean Anecijas and the start of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the enemy, on the contrary, grew.
Following the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have established a record level of support for Ukraine's entry into NATO among Ukraine's citizens — more than 75 per cent.
Despite the support of Ukraine's entry into NATO and the help NATO is making in the war, there is now a lot of criticism on the Alliance's and members of the country's account – for the immediate supply of weapons, refusing to close the sky, not wanting to "response" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will have to give up its desire for membership in the Alliance through the REF position if it can stop the war and Ukraine will have reliable security guarantees, including military.
In the new episode of the "Question of Truth" with the editor of the "European Truth" we are talking about how Ukraine's Alliance has helped from Russia's moment of intervention to criticize NATO, and why Alliance is critical of why our prospects for NATO membership are closer than ever in history and what security guarantees are discussed in the negotiations with Russia can become another Buddhist memorandum.
What do you think is here?
I've got a partner on the loose that I'm looking at.
I gave it to her through this mobile plug.
We don't have visas, we need to go to the convention center and find out how to do it because it was formed in Poland, there were no visas, and there were no passports.
We're going to write to you!
Dennis's gone in a good mood today.
He agreed with a boy from Ukraine who had met yesterday at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's all right.

I'm going to leave the kids I've been waiting for 3-4 years, and I'm going home because I can't leave anymore.
And I'll be with you at 6-7 in the morning
Yes, there was a heart attack.
I had genuine feelings for this man, but he did not do the right thing, and I left him.
In time, he came back and apologized to me.
I rejected him.
Then, after a while, he phoned to see what had happened to his heart.
He just asked me to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost six years.
We had a lot to talk about.
At that time, I began to have problems at work in a parallel setting.
His support also helped me at the time.
That's mutual help.
And I wondered, maybe you really need to look at him differently.
And he suggested that I get married, and two days later he died.
So God has decided our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he's just talking about Czech.
She wanted to tell me that I was able to find a place to live, and I am very happy that I now have a place to live and a place to be with the child.
Did you have to remind me before?
( ) Because I helped look at children in the family.
Don't be sorry, just write things that you don't understand.
I understand that the translator does not always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to a doctor.

It's very nice of you, thank you.
You've raised me up.
Okay, give me something else, so I don't sleep like that, I'm still dying and I'm dreaming of a bomb...
God is never late, for his time and place.
I don't think he wants to bury me:)
I understand the price of unqualified work, and I understand that as much as I did at home in Kiev, I can't have the money I made at home, I'm not going to get right now.
But just sit and don't do anything I can't do, because then all the bad thoughts in the head are going to lie, so you have to do something physical.
Documents from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m. are produced at the airport, and you can just wait.

We met Vic at the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.

And then I'm gone.

Yeah, but I'm gonna do it hard.
Okay, write to me when it's going to be handy.
I don't know what I'm doing with my job until I know it.
Is it better that we change things sometimes?
I'm sorry, I really don't have any missing calls from the middle.
A proposed job, a bathroom and toilet, a three-window bath, a pill.
It's about 3-4 hours.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're all right.
Can I call you?
Or can you write down your wife’s contact?
I'd like to ask what I can buy in the appetizer.
I want to ask you for a reason.

To find help in the pool
But that's my idea.
She's with my uncle at home and she's handed the roll and the bag for the check, she's on them at home, so it's got it.
I've been up for 9 hours, and I'm just ready for breakfast.
I'm very ashamed that you're talking to me in your exit.
We want to report the change in the location and put documents together to continue the map

And I forgot to tell you that tomorrow's gonna be a trial.
One mother said that she was successful for the children of a prostitute.
He's coming to you.
Please tell me, do you have a nearby room pickup schedule in the month ahead, even for a little bit of understanding in what days?
I don't remember this plan
The Russian army is threatening to launch rocket attacks on Kiev: they say, "They haven't done it before."
"We're going to try the division and task of the attack by the Ukrainian army on objects in the RF territory.
If these events continue, the armed forces of the RF will strike at the centre of decision-making, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously been held."
The Russians have launched rocket attacks on Kiev since the first days of the total invasion of the RDF troops in Ukraine.
On February 25, the rest of the Russian rockets, which destroyed the Ukrainian PPO system, fell into a multi-square house on the capitals of the Pognaca.
On 26 August, the Russian rocket entered a multifaceted spaceship in the hope of Valeria Lobano.
On March 1, the Russians entered a television station near Babin Yaru, where 5 survivors were killed.
On March 2, the Ukrainian PPOs were hit by Russian rockets flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence.
On March 14 the victims ’ rockets destroyed the house and trolleybus at Kurenwica, Kiev
On March 18, the Russian rocket entered a live mass in Vinogradaria, where one person was killed, with 19 other victims, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets destroyed the current Retroville TRC in Vinogradary, resulting in at least 4 deaths.
Mer Kieva Vitalio Clicko, who announced on 13 April that the capitals who had been evacuated from the city were on their way back.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still cause rocket attacks on Kiev, as well as a lot of mines and unscathed warheads around the capital.
The main administration of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine's solution was on 12 April that the Russians planned to take the first low-tracracks on the territory of the RF, to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the violence of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, at Belgrade, Russia, the oil station was bombed, as was the result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Belgrade declared that near the city it seemed to fall into the Ukrainian Snare.
It is evident that the Elytes and Washington, and Berlin, are leaving the cold road from the very thought that the Russian bombers will be being shot in the sky in Ukraine.
But the Greens do not talk to them as much as they do to their voters and societies in general.
In his talks in parliaments and in front of many thousands of groups in the largest cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors have ever done.
The Green will not persuade European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, and it will convince the European nations that these politicians choose.
And these conversations, which are filled with power, excitement, and time of distress, gradually achieve their goal.
By the same time, Baiden is categorically opposed to the closing of the sky, 70 percent of his fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is opposed to speeding up Ukraine's entry, this process is already going.
I understand you, so they don't want us to be considered chess.
The costs you will get are better for giving people the more needed.
I can come to you and we can make a decision.

The brain refuses to accept...
I don't have anyone or anywhere to go.
I've got $50 in my wallet, everything we've spent at home.
Many of our leaders didn't pay for our jobs.
Where do I need to go?

What you have in common since the first week

These are small businesses that were covered by volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
They're tractors that actually come out of the field, because it's time to go.
These are bus drivers who today agree to travel to the humconies in the temporarily purchased areas to get help and get people out of there.
These heroic leaders, who fearlessly go to war zones, calm down and help refugees in the cars, and help volunteers to get on in humanitarian vehicles at peaceful stations.
These were the auto repairers who stood on the vital road in the first days of the war and patiently served the frightened and frustrated people.
These firemen repair the waterways and electric lines to provide the people with what is needed.
These are doctors and nurses who, 24 hours a day, save people, not to harm them, but to volunteer for a free moment, collecting the appetizers on the front.
We're in Ukraine, there's a break when the little ones are in bed.)

The post-election area of Ukraine (Northern Ukraine) is a electoral area that combines electoral districts located within Ukraine's borders and consists of premises for voting in Ukraine's missions and councils and military bases,[vinosca] on which Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Cosovo and DDR Congo) are located.[1] The role of the Regional Electoral Commission for the Western Electoral Region is the central electoral commission.
There are only general elections in the Democratic People's Republic of the Congo: the presidential election and the national parliaments and the universal referendums.
Local elections in the U.S.A. are not held.

She went to school today too.
Today I saw Christine's mother, but she didn't even say hello (
Very delicious apples, what's this for?
The head of the office of President Andrey Germ told us that Russia is starting a "female operation" on the weapon that the allies are sending to us.
Directly the German language: "They understand that they win the war, see their distance, and wish to "kill" weapons supplies in any way.
For example, one of the last figures is the destruction of the Slovak C-300.
This information has already been spread by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's going to happen?
They can start a campaign that the Ukrainian soldiers seem to be armed with the allies, and it is massing into the Russian army.
I want to warn you right away.
Because the army in the hands of the U.S. Army sends an enemy to the world.
I'm sorry, she forgot to ask how much she's spent this month, and is she going to work on the train?

We took all the room and moved into the other room. The room was free.
The international community continues to express shock and frustration after the evidence of Russia’s violence against the peaceful population in Ukraine has been shown, and Moscow has rejected these messages as a “provocation. ”
"Report of the victims, raped and severely wounded by Russian soldiers of the Ukrainian peaceful inhabitants of New Zealand," Prime Minister Jasinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, stating that her government is discussing additional steps to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kysida called the incident “an international violation”.
The announcements were made after the announcement that hundreds of peaceful people had been shot and thrown into the brothers ’ barracks or left in the streets in the capital of Kiev, in the Russian army that had left the area after a few weeks of occupation.
Photographs on which the bodies of civilians who had been killed with their hands were shocked by many and led to calls for the strengthening of sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in the radio interview on April 4, which is a sign of the "war crimes" committed by Russian soldiers in Buchi.
"What happened in Buchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed to Russian exports of coal and oil.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain said that Russian soldiers could go so far as to do the "genocide" in Buchi.
"We will do everything we can to keep those who have committed these war crimes from being free of charge," said Sanchez in Madrid.
On April 3th, the U.S. Department of Public Television, Maria Zacharova, rejected the charges as “provocation. ”
Without proof, she said that the United States and NATO had "confirmed" the image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, I think that the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who "sold" this story," said Zechariah.
Previously, the Russian Minoborons also claimed without evidence that the picture of Buchi is “one more permanent Chinese regime” and that all Russian troops left the city until March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to gather on 4 April to discuss what it called the "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Buchi.
The next Committee of Russia announced on April 4 a statement in which he declared "examination" on charges in the vast Ukraine of "uncertainly false information" about the actions of the Russian army in Buchi.
Ukraine's President Volodimir Zelenski said on 3 April, accusing the Russian soldiers of genocide in the city, and told the leaders of Kremlin that they should come to the House to see what their troops had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," said Zelenski in videoconference, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And it's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting in the basement," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the military in Ukraine.
"When we find people tied up with their back and their backs, I don't understand," he said about the scene of victims scattered in the streets of Buchi, the city about 35 kilometers north west of Kiev.
On April 2th, a representative of the Ukrainian Ministry of Freedom saw the streets of a small city as a civilian.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 corpses on the street.
Journalists of the AP saw at least 21 bodies in different places in the House.
The bodies of one group of nine people – all in the civilian – were destroyed on the ground near a place where, according to locals, Russian forces were used as a base.
Apparently, the victims were killed from a nearby distance.
In general, the Ukrainian government stated that at least 410 peaceful people were found in the area of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian soldiers last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They said, "There's no answer."
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible acts of genocide, rape, murder, torture.
In this report there is another point that is now much less information — the export of the local population to the enemy territory.
Near the middle of March, Russian occupations are "equipped" by Ukrainians from the temporarily purchased estates in their territory and the territory of Belarus, which President Lukaschenko himself declared to be under the Russian military police.
"Ukraine Truth" sought out the foreigners and their families to ask how the "evacation" is happening and whether there are ways to return after it to Ukraine.
The hero of this text was volunteered for voluntary evacation within Ukraine under psychological pressure and from escape.
Fortunately, they live and maintain relationships with their families.
However, in view of the claim made by the Ukrainian government, many citizens were exported to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopol, the Russians stole the staff of the second house, brought out of the children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian champion of Joseph Zacapinski's ship.
The family of Oleksandra, Marini, and their 10-year-old daughter, Vali, moved to Godmel in a few months to war.
Alexander himself got a job at Antonov Airport, which is 2.5 miles [2.5 km] away from the village.
The family settled in the military city, although they were civilized.
Like the real plastics, Dennis and Marina have been collecting worried whales long ago, but they haven't made it in the morning of February 24.
They didn't have their car, and the urban bus didn't take anyone anymore.
About 12th of February 24th, they saw the helicopters with Latin letter V, followed by the first shots.
One of them entered a neighbor’s house.
Then the family landed in the basement and stayed there for three weeks until March 17 until the Russian army took them to Belarus.
About 40 people were buried in their basements.
Not everyone decided to go.
"On the 6th night of the 24th of February, people who spoke and did not speak Russian, and not Ukrainian.
They say, "Who is it?" They say, "Come out."
They searched for me, asked who was in the basement or who was armed.
All the men asked whether they were serving in the army.
They said, "We've come to protect you by the command of Ramsana Kadirov."
It was a Czech OMOM, not even a soldier, young boys 25-35 years old.
They said, "We have been helped in the war by the Ukrainians, Sachko Bili, who ordered the Nationalist Movement of the United Nations Wiking, which fought on behalf of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chinese War, the U.S. War, and now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we don't have.
We'll say the water was a big problem with her.
They broke down the store, took the goods from under the heading "all the same Russian concierge" and brought us 6 bottles.
There's still a video on the Internet where children thank Kadari for food.
So this is what they brought into the store after the robbery and they say, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovic."
No one particularly wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful mistake.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give us our phones," they laugh.
Still, they kept separate from the Russians.
They said how good they came because they didn't want war, and the Qur'an supports them, and they're actually good at saying, "Food is a traitor, and the Cadero too, but we can't do anything, because there's our family."
And basically, they didn't fight, but they used to steal stores, they got mad.
The Kurei took it, one attached to one leg to the Georgian arrow, the other to his white Scotch and called it a "police".
In Ukraine, they were not fully prepared.
I don't know how their divorce was working... when they killed them at the House, so they didn't even take the killers, they asked us, "What do you got?"
Moreover, we had been arrested — some of us didn’t know each other, the first day they asked for a password to find out, whether they were strangers or not.
They were with us until March 13th, after the Russian NATO arrived, and behind them was a village dean.
They put 30-40 units between the houses, and we always fell into it from the Bicyclers.
But these came and told us that the U.S. is no longer there, but it's "Azov", and, in their words, "Azov" is 100,000 in Ukraine.
"Kiev seems to have been asking since the beginning of March."
Something happened to us -- a Russian officer, or a desanta, or a fsb representative -- and he says it's going to be evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- there was about Buchu, Master, thinking, maybe we were given a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we've handed down our lists, they've promised to connect with the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're going to be exported to Belarus, and then maybe Rostov."
We say we don't want either here or there.
And they said, "Oh, that's your kids' psychotics!"
As it worked, they took us to the basement and started shooting at us from the bottom of the house, either "The Cities", or the minimote.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned, some of them fell.
In our house there was a direct entrance to the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us to Belarus only, promising to give our brothers and the Red Cross.
The party didn't go, saying it was for the parents' traitors, saying, "You're going to shoot, they're going to sell it to the authorities."
We were dragged through the Chornobyl, on both sides of the road were burned, broke the technique, even though the Belarusians told us that the Russians were going to export it to them immediately.
A lot of Captains, buried in technology, and a soldier.
At the Belarusian crossing point of the "Commar" we went through the improvised control, many of whom were completely undocumented because they were burned.
They put us in the graveyards of the Red Cross, gave us a cup of tea.
And here we hear shots!
Although they from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these planes fly, they're going to cross the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we understand it.
Then we were taken to the bus and put in the Cocky's room near Gomel's.
His manager, Wenger Vasil Stéanovich, came, said, "You, I'm a hero, I'm with Montenegro.
But I understand that Putin and Lukaschen won't stop until these wolves get your money.
The poor people are suffering!
We've got Lukaschenko so good!
He will say, "Yes, he will."
They offered to interview the Belarusian journalists, but no one liked them.
The board's administration told us, "You're already a traitor!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least they called themselves) have spread information that men in Poland are unable to travel.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents — the daughter had no passport.
We had to get him on Monday, and on Thursday the war started.
At the Ukrainian council, we had nothing to do with it, but in Minsk, we were told that no one would take a bus without passports.
I'll tell you here that the Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were also settled in Munich, and the follow - up took place.
They didn't keep up with the catacombs.
Our second group of migrants said that you can enjoy the maximum week-to-half here, because Belarus is not Europe, there's no pay here.
We found an inside passenger who announced to take us out to Warsaw.
On the way to Mozira (about 50 miles [50 km] from the Ukrainian border, we saw the launch of the ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket begins to fly, beautiful, and then gas.
The people sitting on the bus in Mozire told us that the Russians were always shooting at the police.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that something would break a son if he were to be called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is not believed at all.
They say, "You are a poet, and we are a people of peace."
They do not agree that their polygonists are used to attack Ukraine.
In Poland the friends who took us to Estonia were waiting for us.
Now we're going through the registration, we're going to decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia the Ukrainians are now probably as much as the Estonians."
Marina lived in the territory of the military city of Gostomel, along with her brother's family, his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she telephoned the tribals and asked them to collect the most necessary items and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep under the roof of a neighbor’s house.
Maria herself could not return home, and in principle she could not, the house no longer exists.
No one knew so much about evacuation.

On April 1, the city’s capital, Buchi Anatolia Fedoruk, delivered a happy message on March 31, the Korean army released the city from Russian mines.
The next day, the occupationrs were expelled from all of the Kiev area.
However, the joy that the Koreans should feel at this time was filled with fear and hatred, since at the same time it became known that in one house alone, the Russians were at least 280 peaceful people.
They were just killed in the streets, where their hands were tied and shot in the mud, part of the killers were under the age.
Killed and followed by torture, Motizín Olga Suhenko, her husband, Igora, and his son, Oleksandra, were found.
The bodies of Olga and Oleksandra were in the brotherly brain, Igora, in the canal.

President Volodimir Zelenski said that certain types of weapons that the Western partners were hoping for came too late.
That's what he said in an interview with Associated Press, which he published by the President's Office, says "European Truth".
"All the equipment they're sending, for some types of equipment it's done late.
So when we're talking about Mariupol when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's really true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said the Green.
The question is, it's got enough weapons for Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, no."
The president also said that if Ukraine was a NATO member, this war would not be, or it would be otherwise.
"She'd get worse, we'd have close neighbors, we could fight together.
But he was confident that the war would not be that way," he added.
We remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine a new military aid, including a bronchitis and a protorabular weapon.

Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and we don't need Ukrainian television.

And 1+1 is a presidential, propaganda channel, not interested in me at all.

"I'm telling her that "the television and radio remont" has been blocked by import details, while friends and acquaintances are warned not to interrupt the show when they call."
"We've been hiding all month from all sorts of information about war.
As long as it can.
However, in the Plamqui (UP) on the sand and the back of the lakes quickly, this can be caused by stress, changes in the throat, and loss of vitamins.
The last two reasons are removed, and that's not the stress I'm worried about.
A flame, unlike the sky, doesn't sound, sounds, and sounds, and shoots."
Because Olga hears bad and spends most of her time in her room, her month's news stayed in a room with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93, Oxana Polova took the gun first in her life.
"33 days I, as a partner, lived with her in the room.
The war was also taken away from her, and what I was about to do was come as usual for a few hours.
But when her husband spoke to her, I gave her the receiver, she listened for four hours, then she sang for two hours.
The receiver was always at the bedside.
Most of the time, the universe is in its own room.
I felt bad, and that allowed me to be blind to her.
If I heard the sound of her walking, I'd hide in my room.
Before long, she hid from her receiver and the TV.
And then she called everybody she's talking to, it's 6-7 people.
She asked to talk to her about what was appropriate, not just war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning and to the end
Just 17 April -- I got 2 rooms:)

The British, who in the Soviet Union banned Mariupol, says he's ready to appear in a pool to the Russians
Britain, who is a military officer at the coast of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, who takes part in the defense of Maripol, told his friends and family that they would make weapons and enter Poland to the Russian occupations.
Source: Twitter page by Eedina Eislin, British, who served in the UK since 2018, VVS with contact with family and friends of Eislin, Atlas News with the words of my friend Eislin, who spoke with him
"We've been getting a message from him for 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Maripol, but we don't have a choice, except for the success of the Russian army.
We had no food and no weapons.
Thank you, everyone, I hope the war will be over soon."
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Special Brigadier of the U.S. Navy, who participated in Mariupol's military operation.
U.S. Journalists contacted the mother of military officer Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son on the phone told her that they were planning to appear in Poland.
A former military officer, Brian Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that in his last phone call, Aislin spoke about the plans of their division from the capital.
According to him, fighting and food ended in the brigade.
The Atlas News magazine contacted his friend who said that Islanders are going to appear in the fields to Russian plants so that they don't get to the arms and bullets of the so-called "corrigors" command.
There were also radio recordings of a telephone talk that apparently took place with a well - known American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Evelyn said that they were trying to get out of town in a civil suit, but they couldn’t.
The British told him earlier that in Instagram, he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in New York-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in the fight against terrorists called the Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018 he officially entered the U.S. Army and took the oath.
Evelyn’s friends and neighbors were known as Johnny, and in the summer he was better known as Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know whether we're together or not.

It was a pleasure to welcome you, but she wanted to do some things.
I'll ask the man tomorrow if he'll be there tomorrow.
When you come home, write me, please, I need to talk to Daniel.
Most of the attackers for their losses in the war were playing full.

Their bodies will be cast into the Fire of Hell.

I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us because it was the last hope, the truth.
I'm not afraid of working, as I was living in the village, so I can and I love to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You're very interested in tradition, we're going to Christmas.
Last week, the High Council welcomed Bill 7176, which has the name "Towards the implementation of the monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics".
It's amazing that the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the area of the economy has been... the place where the members of the company and the banks are meeting.
The sponsors of the bill believe that the decision by the company’s supervisory board in the state of Kiev can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine’s national security.
We know about the number of new threats to the company, but we still do not know about any company that needed to hold a physical meeting on the site.
The potential threat of such a law has been understood as a wonderful basis for all supply to the difficult post-Hydness Revolution, including independent supervisory advice, and then to set up manual management.
The one that was until 2015.
Why do oversight companies need to be included in them?
More than that, if one of the harmful drafts is "flying" under the Patriotic Gas, others can fly tomorrow, for example, through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be written on war.
In fact, this initiative was still under way before the start of the war and the 7176 bill.
Thus, on 22 February, this standard was introduced to a comparable table of law 5397.
In general, however, a desire to give up supervision in one way or another has been a circulation among some of the peoples of the world for a long time.
Not because of criticism like that, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider the arguments that have explained the need for acceptance.
And then let's give our proposals how to resolve the issue of anti-competitive management during the war.
The prime minister of the economy, Dennis Quddin, explained the need for such a novelty to lose the Internet and other means of communication that would make it possible to avoid the work of surveillance.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board can't make the necessary decisions, which could be parallelized by the company's work.
We agree that such a risk is, but could it prevent him from being transferred to Ukraine by the members of the Watch Tower Society?
Let us imagine a situation in which independent members of the supervisory board (who are most of the whole) will put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, they can be released under the bill.
And more quickly, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the monitoring of any decision.
Instead, it will not be possible to appoint new independent members of the supervisory board quickly, as the law foresees the need for a competitive team that lasts between 3 and 4 months.
Thus, the proposal for draft legislation 7176 will soon be unable to prevent the loss of the supervisory board from making a decision, and sooner or later it will lead to that!
The national parliament, author of the Dmitro Nataluh bill, gives other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes: "Many companies, especially the armed business complex (OPC), now need broadcasts" and therefore, "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from the Zoo Day."
At first, in Ukraine, there are almost no OPCs that have oversight advice.
The board of oversight is a bug in the Ucroboronprome, which actually manages almost all OPK holdings.
But even in the "Croboron Promos", according to the law, the Board of Supervisors has quite limited compliance, and all its members do their duties on a non-free basis.
All of the authorities in the "Ucrobonrons" are the Director-General, who will decide on the need to relocate the OPK or other company that is part of the concert.
Moreover, this argument does not support criticism, since draft 7176 does not at all introduce any changes to the legislation governing the activities of OPC.
Mr. Dmitro on his Facebook page also provides arguments that can refer to the category "emotional".
Such arguments, as usual, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of the company and the banks, but let's try to figure out some of them, and let's say, "strong experts in the first word "war" still remain in Ukraine in 2021, but while the members of the state-owned companies in Ukraine are left with a full picture of hundreds of thousands of dollars, while Ukraine is actually suffering from war."
First of all, it's manipulation -- most of these observers never lived in Ukraine and only came here periodically.
So to say they're "remaining Ukraine," I mean, unjust.
Secondly, as a result of the pandemic of the Coronavirus, both foreign and Ukrainian observers have long been involved in the practice of online meetings.
This tool has long been widely used in world practice, and it has been done in a wide variety of ways: business, education, medicine, and so forth.
It is also important to remember that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
And as a rule, these people have a different business, and what electronic means are helping them do this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not express identical claims to members of the supervisory board who are thieves?
Because they don't even know where their companies are.
In fact, this is not the first popular attempt to get foreigners from the surveillance councils, and war is just a new opportunity.
Hi, I'm in Ukraine, and I'm looking for a possible option for a temporary shelter in the family, with me two children.

In the Brovards, Highlands, and Buchanan regions of the Kiev area, which were set free from the occupations, a two - hour commandant hour was launched.
Directly Pauluka says: "In the rurals of the provinces of the Brovary, the Highlands and the Buchanan regions, which were under Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian defence forces, the commandant hour was strengthened!
In the territory of these cities and the border forces will operate from 21:00 2 April to 06:00 5 April".
Details: According to the head of the wave, it is now categorically forbidden to stay on the streets of the settlement and in other public places, to move through transport and sand.
The residents can go out on the street only during the alarm to get to the shelter.
Such restrictions have been imposed in order to remove the effects of the Russian aggression — to clean and relocate the territories.
Omeljanuk invited those who had left these areas to stay from home.
In the rest of Kiev, the command year will last from 21:00 to 6:00 a.m.

The Lukaschenka regime held three 27 - and 28 - year - olds who were involved in the destruction of two religious signs under the Osipovics, which provides for the movement of railways.
Source: "Radio Freedom", the legal centre "Water", the head of the ISV criminal militia, Gennadi Kazakević, quoted by Belta.
In the IVB, Belarus reported that three residents of Bobruís were detained on the night of 30 March for strong support.
According to The Truth, the men were actively opposed and tried to escape when they were arrested.
The security forces used the weapon.
One of the prisoners was injured and was in a hospital.
Others were provided with medical assistance at the site.
Chief of the Criminal Police of the IMF, Bilorussian Gennadi Kazakovic stated that "the acts of terrorism on the RB railway will be severely halted" by the use of weapons.
On April 6th, it was reported that on March 30, the police arrested another Balourian railway worker, Baranovic's "BJD" staff, and the BGD's thematic resource manager at "Vkontaktia" and "Onoclasses" Valentina Samasuka.
Where he lives now and in which state he is unknown, he reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March in Belarus, at least 40 passengers were arrested.
We remember: The BYPOL formation, announced by Lukaschenka extremist mode, continues to call for Belarus to make a difference in the rail transport and infrastructure of Belarus under the "Help" plan.
In this way, the Belarusian "rescue parties" are trying to counter the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
According to the B.C.E., in Ukraine, power and technology are being turned into war.

The United States prohibits investment in the RF and imposes sanctions on Putin's daughter
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, impose new sanctions on President Putin's daughter, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and ban all new investments in Russia.
This is the message on the Web site of the White House.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution, which is owned by the government, and Alpha-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prevent US citizens from carrying business with them.
In addition, the States are taking a full ban on new investments in the IMF.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Baiden will sign a new order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector's exit includes producers, energy companies, large-scale traders, financial institutions, and other service providers such as legal and consular companies," says the White House.
Thirdly, new sanctions from the United States have been imposed against the major Russian state enterprises in the critical area.
This will prevent US citizens from carrying out operations with these organizations and freeze any assets they have in the jurisdiction of the United States.
The detailed list of Mindfin will appear the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the full blockade of the assets of Putin's full-time children, wives and daughters of Minister of Finance of Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the president and Prime Minister Dmitry of Russia, Prime Minister Michael Misustin.
Sanctions remove them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

They isolate the Russian office: they stop investing and stop supplying.
But we didn't understand.
There was no military service in our home.
Our house is near the military section and the oil tank
He just helped me because I wouldn't do it myself.
I'm so ready, I'm not asking for a ride, and I'm giving you good advice.
I'll give it to myself.
It's a little hard for me, but I understand I have to go through this stage.
We'll meet at 4:00 and we'll tell you everything.
It's all right.
game how often you get home
I'll go home every week.
I'm sorry, there's no programs, but I'm trying to figure out.
I Wanted to Be a Teacher
My girls can't move right now, so I didn't write my own house.
She wanted to ask you that if you'd hear about living information, I'd like to know.
I'd be happy to spend my life with a good girl.
If you might know that, let me know.
On my side, I'm not going in.
Thank you very much.
You haven't written another person to Natal 54. Please write the exact address and how many courses are cost.
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
Besides, I didn't change it, it's one of my births:)
Good day, Mr. Reiard, I'm sorry I didn't see it.
We're going to the Medical Committee now.
That's why Annie needs to work this time another day.
What day would it be better to come before? (maybe a little more work?)
I'll hear it tomorrow, it's bad work on the Internet.
You're happy to do what you're gonna do.
Thank you.. we found something, but there was nothing...
Both beginners, other than objects we don't know
Nothing's happening.
May I see you on Monday 25.04?
The kids can take it with them, the game here is enough:)
I thought about my father.
I'm probably very curious or very in love, but I'm thinking about this money.
We'll do it somewhere.
But as it will be paid, please, no credit.
Write me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
You need to take with you the collection they gave you?
Today's not my day.
Something from you came, I don't see what it is.
I'm also very sad.
I'll remind you of the fact that you're late
Do you have only a father who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a fellow student want to build a house and how many houses are in a window?
I'm ashamed to get you out of your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
I'm glad to respect Joe Despenz, he's doing research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons.
Natalya Nagorna's TV journalist "1+1" appeared on the morning of 12 April, which was handed to her by the military 36th coast of the Sea of Maripole.
The soldiers tell him that they did not have any weapons to share in the wars and the suffering of the wounded.
They said "the account's going for an hour."
Earlier, on 11 April 36, in particular the Bridge of the Sea of the Sea, which participated in the defense of Mariopoli, published a call for Russian-speaking foreigners.
It was reported that on 11 April it could be the last fight for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command was not connected with the fighters for two weeks.
The synopsis were said to have been published in Russian.
Commander General of the Military Forces of Ukraine, Valerie Prison, assured that the connection of command with defence forces in Mariupoli is not to be a matter of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block the Ukrainian soldiers on the Austals field in Mariupoli and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11th, the Russian occupations took on Mariupol a devastating element of unknown origin.
As told by the leader "Azova" by Andre White, the RF Army used a chemical weapon against the Asstall camp, which holds soldiers of the Azov tribe.
Thank you, I'll adjust to you.
The situation and ourselves until we stay here.
2 hours drive )) journeys, my mom in stores and back)!
It's not important.
She forgot what she's doing here.
Escadry of Czech drones has since begun flying over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional computers will be used to detect, but only one of them will be directly destroyed by the enemy garner.
Two Caribbean and two Czech brothers were sent to Ukraine last afternoon with the delegation of the Mukacheev city of Volodymir Labuttenka.
Today, their inter-agency friends, along with the community council director and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasilem Sührer, have brought damages for them: they have received special assignments from Ukrainian soldiers in various cities where war continues.
With the goal of maximizing the efficient and safe use of computers, we'll be left in the dark now.
Four of the friends who help the Ukrainian army from Czechia to stop planning to stop, say that the next few days to Ukraine will send many more interesting gifts, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupation and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I love sweet, but I can't.
I'm afraid we won't make it.
I'll be back in Ukraine soon, continue to work
All right, if it's all right, I'll agree.
I'll try myself, but if there's any trouble I'll write to you if I can?
A Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady's village of Jehu, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no one alive.
Maybe she'll hurt and she'll wake up.
Today, I received a telephone call.
And I think I'm still on the street today.
Drinking drugs and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but I'd better meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, take the music you like.
I'm curious about what you have music to do with.
Mom and Dad need to listen
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's knees.
It's got colder and rain today, it's supposed to be hot tomorrow.
But not damage to destroyed houses, damage to the people over which the occupyers are destroyed
In Herson, the occupying Powers were introduced to the Memorial of the Peace of Ukraine in Herson on the streets of Perkopski.
Details: It is noted that the European Union's reputation was ignored, destroyed the panels with photos of the sky hundreds and lost in the Russian-Ukraine war.
The appellants watched the portraits of the heroes of Heaven's hundreds and the lost participants in the Russian-Ukraine war.
You've made a mistake.
Good morning, thanks to the kids on the couch, we don't have this habit, so we didn't know, gave the kids only chocolate and butter, maybe something else needed to be done.
There's someone in the Czech Republic to talk, if that's what I'm talking about.
'Cause I live a guy in the garden where twelve people will be here, and then they'll go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
Today he was in the desert.
Even today he's sleeping there.
That's why we've got a big deal of progress.
I'm obliged to bring the grapes together!
I don't have the power to do them today.
Since I leave the day and the time I've been working for the hotel, I can say about a quarter of a month because I already have a nearby room collection schedule.
In May, I can say about the end of April or at the beginning of May.
She just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry she didn't get out of bed for a long time and got a little sleep.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we'll meet after your arrival.)
He's a humble man, and he's been learning a lot lately, and he realized that he really needs it in his life.
( Hi.) Everything went well.
I was a little surprised to work with people on such a high position.
Today, there is a lesson from a woman who is the director of the department of the economy in the high country.
She was very pleased with my work.
It's a bad thing in my ass. I've been doing a good job.
On Monday, I have to give proof of my work as well as of my willingness to pay for the preaching work.
I'm tired of Friday
I don't do anything just a lot of them and sleep 0.000 (and drink a lot of water )
If you go to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if you can.
I've got another analysis
And then you don't have to walk again.
It's a very bad sight, it's a bad smell, it's a bad smell.
That's it. That's it.
Can you send me the right e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to a course in the Czech language you wrote on.
And do the children feel that they should be there, or should they be there with them?
And now there's one question you can ask.
When Help Is Needed
If I don't make a mistake, you celebrate Easter today, right?
At first, we didn't really want you to collect costs so people don't think we're expecting it!
But I didn't have two points to fill online:
I'll be able to rest, get energy and energy, thank you for the present gift.
It's gonna be fine, because the whole family's going to draw.
The University of Karainese calls on workers and students to carefully check any information, not to rely on anonymous sources in the media and social networks, listening and platform.
Focus only on official information.
that you can count on me, thank you!
my other brother who remained in Ukraine also helped the army
She picked up a few jobs for the portfolio.
After the holiday, they have to go online.
I want to be your backup designer.
How I miss the day I wasn't at work is a vacation
Chief's statement: Russia is preparing a provocation in the District to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may be prosecuted in the Transnistrian Region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "in aggression against the neighbouring state".
"It is not excluded from carrying out the armed forces of the Russian Federation on the territory of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring country."
Details: The opponent continues to create the next military grouping for action on the Slojana route.
Likely, in the near future, the tenants will try to resume.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personal equipment, equipment, and technology to participate in war operations in Ukraine.
The preparation of weapons and military technology is being carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th single motorcycle belt (Monosterista) of the 5th General Army of the East Army.
It is likely that the designated weapon will be moved to a temporarily purchased area of the Danube area.
In addition, 29 General Army troops of the East Army are being deployed to restore the personal composition of the Battalion Tactical Group of 36 Special Motorcycle Brigadierships (Borzia, Zambian Territory).
An enemy's particular problem is the integration of the crew of drivers and mechanics.
The receipt of the selected personal collection from the point of permanent disposal is scheduled for the second half of this year.
Probably, the opponent, in order to disrupt the supply of troops to the point of carrying out the war, continues to attack the transport infrastructure in Ukraine with a view to destroying them or removing them from the ship.
The various armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the task of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Blood Border in the Brest and Gomel areas.
In a separate direction, the 6th General Army and the coastal northern army continue to block the city of Harkov, and the artillery attacks continue in particular areas of the city.
In the Islamic direction, the atmosphere continues to develop in order to reflect the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
That's why the opponent's BPLA Orlan-10.
The forces of the two Battalion tactics groups of the enemy tried to make progress in the direction of the Dovgenek and Dmitrewka points, and they failed to reach a previously held position.
In the South, the opponent continues to focus on the acquisitions under the control of the occupied points of Popasna, Rubižne, Lower and Novabhumutka, as well as the establishment of full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy was trying to do a horrible thing in the gold field, and he was not successful.
In Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupations continue to be afloat in the Austal and the port of the sea.
The forces of the enemy's individual breeders have been able to attack the positions of the Ukrainian army in the areas of the occupied points of Highskopil, Labour and Maryansk.
In the territory of the Danube and the Lugan area, Ukraine's defenders have been attacked by four enemy attacks over the past time, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armored, six units of car technology and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
Of course we're trying to achieve it, but I doubt it.
And you can sleep and I'll keep you
You're not exactly against me to come?
Maybe you just don't want to see today, so tell me, I get it.
Thank you. We didn't even watch TV at home and then more than 1+1. We don't need to set up:)
I'm going to include a TV here except to listen to the language.
I have today's final tariff package for the month :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy the theme for extracting, queening, nipples for lifting
I understand, then I can prepare materials in this area.
I'm asking her, and I'm a little ashamed to ask her, and she gives us so much pirogues.
We'll meet with my father.
I've read a statement in the Facebook page that maybe Google wrote something. I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we're the things you've brought, but are there things that little things we can do for you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about getting a job.
If Mr. Director adjusts, I can start working the following week because tomorrow I plan to go to the office to submit the documents (if available because they are very large) and on Saturday rain:)
Looking for a Brigade at the beginning, I loved chemistry at school, learning Czech, so that I could know, I'd like to work on the tea
Friends of old and not very, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends of the spirit and the mind.
Now you've been through a lot of hard times.
During the last month, I was in touch with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from foot to head, like the life of every thief.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have learned to be forgiving and to be ashamed of your country’s deeds in connection with your neighbors.
That's why they give up Ukraine for your name.
Some of you, activists, have been at risk for a long time, and you've been ready for a decisive attack.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from the Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, as usual, Sasha answered with a lacony answer.
Others are the active cultures, artists, critics, writers, and writers who are affected by your critical world.
No one likes Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be open: except for a very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Journal, in the Echo Moscow, in the Medus, in the organization of the Naval and in other places -- did many of you want to do anything against this regime?
In addition to the fact that they were in the city when they were still there.
Also read the Russian journalist's column "To hide, to speak"
If so, are you not sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstract?
Perhaps they have called on you for your constant concern about what is happening around you, your patio, and your passive partner, who are now likely to have a great deal of pressure on your soul and heart?
That's not always the case.
In 1990 there was a short period when you were ruled by freedom and democracy to a certain extent – without even a cause, but really.
But 1991 did not appear to be better than 1917.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, you end up in such a deep fear that you are looking for salvation behind the king's back, leave his name Stalin or Putin?
As long as he didn't kill people, you all seem to be safer with him.
True, mistakes were made.
Instead of attracting and overthrowing the KBB archives, as did the Germans from the stage, you took the soul to the memory of the Georgian – and allowed the CDB to lean on the bottom, renew, transform and capture the government over the country.
When you were given a choice between the country of refuge and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option — and you humbly agreed with the city.
In 1998, your economy fell, and it called the end of massive struggles for great social justice or for war in Chechnya.
Life became a matter of prime concern.
And then Putin, a young, interesting, aggressive young man, promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
A few of you have bought it, but you have all voted for one or more of it, or you have given the preference not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya with the earth again, most of you were attracted to it.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya, helping the victims of the Putin Anti-Terrorist Operation, and I saw in my eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar City, Itum-Cali and other cities.
Sometimes on the way out I went back to Moscow and enjoyed my company, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the tortures of peaceful people, the killings of children, the soldiers who sold their dead bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Breed, we've already got your check." I'm very well aware of these words.
And I said, "Dear, it's not my Czech, it's your Czech.
It's your country, fuck you, not mine.
I'm just an idiot here.
It's your government that bombs one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then the economic growth of the zeros, expressed by increasing oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through the finger on that part of the stolen money will remain in the middle class pockets.
Many of you have become well - off, some rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired a new life and found a better job.
The prices grew, and are they poor?
The Mosquito sat down and washed from the glass.
When several opposers — Yuria Šecchiina, Anna Politkoska, Oleksandra Lithuanianka and others — were killed, many of you were shocked and scared about what had happened.
However, the matter has not yet been resolved.
When Putin, after two terms, handed over the post of President Medvedev, and took the position of Prime Minister, you as I see, were quickly taken into account.
When a few months later, when the government of the Mediterranean Russia invaded Georgia, most of you were either ignored or tortured.
How many of you have I met in the next year on the mountain slopes of Guadeloure, in front of the Kazbeg or in the coffee and Turkish lakes of Tbilisi, until the part of this country was purchased by your army?
I have to admit that either we or we in the West did a lot of things if they did anything at all.
A little confusion, a little sanctions; but what was meant by the fact that Russia is more critical of international law when the Great Test of Russian oil, gas and the Internal Market was so severe?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important.
By the end of 2011, however, my Russian friends had disappeared.
When Putin once again spoke with the media and took the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went out to protest.
The name of Naval has become alive, you haven't gone out of the street for six years, and the regime has finally felt a fear of losing the ground under your feet.
Then he hit the answer.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands of them were found behind bars.
Some have received grand terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"It's so strong, and we're so weak."
Well, look at the Koreans.
Consider what they did two years ago.
Disregarded by the proselytism president who betrayed their European hopes, they once captured Maidan — and never abandoned him.
They took the city itself and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to protect him by means of the police, the army, and the cocktails of Molotov.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running, the protesters went through the attack.
Many have died, but they have won.
The fugitive became Yanukovic, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose their leaders on their own, and to reject them if they did wrong.
Mydan didn't really like Putin.
That was a bad example.
So, when he used the total amount, he caught the Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, but you benefited from this little bit.
And how many of you were trapped!
As far as I know, 91% of Russia's citizens supported the anxieties.
From early on, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his hat quickly came back to 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I found it hard to find the reason, as soon as we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who stayed with my friends spoke mostly.
"We don't care about politics," you said.
And you were new in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, almost as new after the restoration of Moscow in 2012, with their bunnies, the general wafe and the hipster coffee.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it's just getting better.
You have recently paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
THE idea of being there... even a Moscow editor who released my book on Syria, criticised it in the interview, because I probably didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least, I went there and I saw myself in the streets of Homs, where state soldiers were shooting coldly at my children.
Of all the citizens of Russia, there were only your soldiers who started bombing thousands of peaceful citizens in 2015 and gained experience in the next major war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"First they came to socialists, but I spoke -- because I'm not socialist.
Then they came for the professors, but I spoke because I'm not a professor.
Then they came to the Jews, but I spoke to them, because I am not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one else who could say anything about my protection."
How many of you were talking about spies, Syrians, or foreigners?
Some of you did.
But most of them spoke.
Some actually speak now — such as Dmitro Gluhovskii, Michelo Shishkin, Michelo Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from the border, some from the middle of the country, such as Marina Ovsennikova, risking entering a new GULAG or classing a New Company.
As far as others are concerned, you are familiar with the country in which you live.
So I'm sure you'll understand that when Putin gets involved with the thieves, or what seems very likely, if he doesn't get it, he'll take it for you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are brave, but most of the ones who have gone out to protest and still have a little term, but soon it gets more serious.
Thousands of you have signed a petition that expressed a disillusionment in social networks (even a black square in Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Sometimes when 10 or even 25 years of free will were given just by anecdotes, they did not remain in such a distant past — and now they are, with great likelihood, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you, and who will be left?
The example of foreigners – even more than 2014 – is afraid of the pathic regime: they show that they can fight it.
And the mind, motivation, and greed can stop him, which would have been not on the paper of his advantage.
In view of all of this, few in Russia realize this as well as what is going on in the war.
But you, my friends, know what's going on right now.
You're reading foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, which you support.
And Putin knows you know.
So be ready.
You'll understand what's going on.
Good life in exchange for your speech has finally come to an end.
Your choices are just a hohm, your laws, if you don't pay attention to the repressions, they're not worth more than the paper they're written on, there's no more of your last free media, your economy is ruining faster than I'm writing, you don't have credit cards to buy a ticket on a flight by the border, even if some races have left.
Now Putin will not satisfy your tongue, he will demand your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or go, or you'll be disappointed.
I doubt you'll see another option.
And yet there's still another one.
What's the end of this regime?
And perhaps under the circumstances that you have been raised, you will need to be less than you think.
Think about it.
Iskra is not frightening to you: because of the economic collapse in Russia, it is most likely to burn in the province, in small towns.
When prices go up and no payments are paid, those who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go to the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he's afraid of the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, my friends.
But if each city goes out on its own, as it has done on a regular basis, it will not be hard to get rid of them.
Organization and coordination will be required. The group will need to be converted to a mass.
You have this great magic tool -- the Internet that can limit the mode, but which is still working and which can be adjusted almost anything.
The organization of the Naval was organized, but it could create other, more informal, more decentralised.
You're a lot, millions of you.
The Moscow police can deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If it goes out over 300 thousand, it'll be crushed.
The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all, what did he have to do with them in Ukraine, all because he forced them to leave?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will be afraid of them. Those who have children will be afraid of them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I'd be afraid of you, too.
For example, Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what is happening to those who are trying to blame their master, who are not just demanding freedom, but who are really trying to get it.
But even if you don't do anything, the endless lives of people will be lost forever.
Your son will end the game in a computer game room - and will be arrested; your daughter will talk online - and you will be arrested; your close friend will commit a mistake - and he will die in a serial camera under police doors.
This is what has been happening for many years — and will continue to be strengthened by gaining greater and greater levels.
So you don't have a choice, and if you don't do anything, you know what's going to happen.
Be cool, think strategically, and reach out for it to become reality.
We were on Friday at work, told us we could come on Monday.
We'll be home at night.
What You Think of Me as a Secretary
old man, how often do you go to dinner in the street restaurant?
Once on a trip, I'm staying for dinner in the street restaurant.
(I'm trying to explain everything to her)
So we liked it very well, and we wanted something more, so it's a better option.
She lived in a place where there was a lot of people, and she got tired of energy.
I feel bad about myself, cough, temperature, loss of voice, weakness and headaches
I have to go to that government of work.
We've already done this, but we've been told who's registered in the flower money just at the end of the month.
We'll go to the hospital with the kids on the fourth floor.
But last night I wrote a lady who liked your work, and she wanted something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for her new news and an official report.
While working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a hard psychological, responsible, intelligent job that I was completely disappointed.
It's a waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am a Communist, but I have a serious view of love and marriage.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, problems with his heart.
I think people should love, respect, trust each other to create the family.
Now, I didn't find that.
Good day. Where in Iglow can you get forms to celebrate Christmas (papers or siklons)?
All right, thanks for the advice, then I'm going to bring in a witness to Vala right now.
She's got a CDP in her bed state, she's now down in her hips, she's in her bed, she's in bed, she's eating all over in the bathroom.
Mr. Reahard, I'm sorry I'm worried about you at work.
But I have important questions for you.
I went to the playroom to Natalia today to say hello to her.
She had a bad situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child because she said she came to see things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our baby room until 19:00.
Is that really possible?
Worktime room up to 4:00.
And finally it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a store to open a very weak web page.
Good morning, we're all fine.) The car's working, we're done yesterday, and I'm with the elders before the exam in the gym.
It's the most important thing to get rid of the geometry.
On Saturday, Volodymir helped us.
She studies at the university and in high school.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
Thank you so much for your life.
Yeah, but I thought you didn't.
We're trying to get the sum by the end of the week to calculate
The situation of Russia's invasion – Brifing Chief of the Office of President Oleksia Arrestovic (10.04.2022)
The director of the Office of the President told of the Georgian actions of the senior military officer in Mariupoli -- he was found and injured, so he was on the radio station so that he would not get into a hostile situation.
I have a very important question to ask if they will help me put on my grandson's face my 5-year-old (Bronchial asthma) right now in her nose and throat...
We need a family doctor for her who will understand a little Ukrainian or Russian language.
The doctor’s final advice is very concerned about her condition.
We live in Chechia Dolní Chabry. We need a doctor who is both here in Dolní Chabry or somewhere else maybe Brno but not far from the metro so we can get there.
The show was very popular.
The metallics sat with the children on their hands and feet.
How's your day?
Lord, I'm so grateful to you for not saying, thank you very much.
Mom's been there since 4 o'clock.
Perhaps the householder will leave his phone for the conversation.
I think this house is the best option in Prague-8.
The director told me nothing about the possibility of sponsoring the child’s diet.
I was given such information to pay.
In March and in April, I was already paying for food.
If you had the opportunity to help me pay for the wheat and the red?
