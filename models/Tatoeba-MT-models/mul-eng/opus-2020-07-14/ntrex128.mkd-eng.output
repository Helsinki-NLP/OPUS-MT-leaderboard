Members of the Wells National Assembly are worried that "they look like maps"
Some of the members of the congregation are surprised by their proposal to change their call to MWP (Member of the Hungarian Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this can be an object of ridicule.
One member of the Laburist Party's congregation said his party was concerned that "he's with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't talk big: on big twp means "bullest/sold", and pwp means "like".
Plaid's member said the party in general "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party was "freedom" for the change in the name, but he noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "mapet" (Ang. Muppet) was great.
In this context, the word "w" is similar to the Greek-English version of the letter "u".
The Commission of the National Assembly, which is currently preparing the law to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on which the members of the congregation are to be named, of course, will bring the members themselves."
The law of the Wells government of 2017 empowered the Wells Congregation to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of consultations with the public on the proposals that showed great support for the appointment of the Assembly as the World Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the members of the congregation, the Commission prefers Members of the large parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of Parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus may lead to headlines for the President of the Congregation, Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce a draft law for changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the congregation and the design of the committee system.
The members of the congregation will make the final vote on the question of their calling when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote at a referendum on the change in the name of the country.
The voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name has changed in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote was put in an attempt to resolve the decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time insisted that her northern neighbour's name represents a legitimate position in her territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to enter the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opposition to the Plenary for a change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change in the name is simply the price to be paid for entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's funeral ended while the churches in Harlem faced problems
"Historic, the old people I talked to say that every corner had a bar and a church," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is no one else."
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the people where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later, they will return to the same place as they started.”
The churches, he added, can be replaced with building buildings full of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the village.
"Most people who buy buildings in these buildings are white," he said, "and that's why the day when these churches are closed completely because it's unlikely that most of the people living in these buildings will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by a white assembly before Harlem to become a Metropolis Metropolis community in 1870 and a decade later by St. Martin.
The original assembly of white-methodists has been out in the 30s.
The organization of blacks who practice their faith close to home takes over the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken from the blacks assembly during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the fight of the 125 salesmen, the main street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was very damaged in 1939, but since Father Johnson’s parishioners had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillion.
Priest David Johnson, the son of the father of Johnson and the successor of St. Martin, proudly called the carillion “the voice of the poor. ”
The expert who played the carillion in July called it "cultural wealth" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carillion in the world to play black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carillion in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part of the non-managed church leaders, and part of the Episcopal Episcopal Epistle.
The church committee – the leading body of the church, composed of non-religious leaders – writes to the Eparhia in July with concern that the Eparhia "will want to transfer its costs" to the church committee, although the church committee was not involved in the operation of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the Eparhia.
Some members of the parish have complained about lack of transparency by the European side.
Aicula hurt a 13-year-old child when he was in prison in California
Aikola attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday, while a jastrosium storm in California, on the day of the opening of the season, the authorities said.
The attack took place about seven hours ago near the beach of Bikon in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel reported on KSWB TV in San Diego that he had spent about an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and then went to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel said that he first thought it was an encouragement to catch a horse, but then "he realized he said, 'I'm late!
I'm late!'
The whole key bone was looking at him," Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, 'There's an eagle in the water!' added Hamel.
The boy was taken to a helicopter at the child hospital Radi in San Diego, taken as a critical condition.
He doesn't know who the shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gils, told the press conference that a few weeks ago, the shark was detected in the area, but they decided that the shark was not of a dangerous nature.
Gils added that the victim was hit by traumatized wounds in the top of the chest.
The authorities closed the beach from the coast of Ponto in Casablad to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to research and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with jewelry in the style of shopping houses full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the UK beauty market that weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales in the area of fashion and household fall, large beauty craft will be tested in 11 salesmen each year in the country, and will be presented to more sellers next year as they appear to be successful.
The investment in beauty appeared after supermarkets began looking for ways to use the space of the raffles that was once used for televisions, microwave ovens, and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's they said that for the first time, they would double the offer of beauty to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branding areas similar to those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also re-starts its series of Boutique smiles, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something more demand from younger consumers.
In addition, the brand-new Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops, from which the first opened in Creedon, south London, last week, and the second opened in Selie Oak, Birmingham, a later year.
Buying online and purchasing trend reduces the daily food base in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cup, director of Sainsbury's, said salesmen would look more like stores because the supermarket synergy is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and products that don't eat.
Sainsbury's began to become the sellers of Argos in hundreds of shops, and also introduced a number of Habitat dealers after he bought them and two unions two years ago, which, according to them, increased the sales of peacekeepers and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and formation departments failed.
Sainsbury's has tested a joint merger with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation has ended up in disagreement with how to divide the profit of chemical vendors into supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical dealers to Celesio, the owner of synergy Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands for him on his skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Saninsbury's commercial director, said: "We transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty crafts to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in special training colleges that would be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and suitable locations mean that we are now a duty destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "white" since Holly Willowby withdrew from the contract worth 11 million pounds
The star Peter Jones from Dragons Den went "white" after TV driver Holly Willowby withdrawn from a contract worth 11 million pounds with his brand-new lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their brand Truly for products and household supplements.
The two business is connected to the Goop brand of Gwenet Paltrou.
This 37-year-old leader of the morning program told Instagram he's leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, Dragons Den's star, withdrawing from their profit-effective brandy business for life-style at the last moment to focus on her new big agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "beneficial" when a television golden girl admitted during a tennis meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean that she no longer has time to devote to their Truly brand for household products and supplements.
The business is linked to the Goop brand of Gwent Paltrou and was said to double the wealth of Willowby's 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he left Truly, Jones quickly left Britain in one of his weekends.
One source stated: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It should have been her long-term future that she would have sent in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned takes them totally unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
Marlow's seat has a full range of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving this leader of a morning program, which is one of Britain's most paid stars, can make the company millions because of large investments in perfumes and candles products, and even clothing and household products, and because of the potential for further retirement.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, the mother of three children, and Dan Boldwin's husband is close to Jones and his wife Tara Kap for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
Both go for a break together and Jones has a 40% share of Bolivia's television production company.
Willowby has to become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Anton McCpartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebrity (I am the star) of the ITV.
A source near Jones yesterday said "We don't comment on his business prospects."
A serious talk "and then we fell in love"
He was laughing at the criticisms he'd get from the media to comment that some would consider him "non-presidential" and because he's so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trip spoke with his voice translated as a "Presenter of news".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have declined.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see "a suitable answer" from the United States for the early moves of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure under control.
Tramp takes a much more optimistic view of his speech at the milling.
"We agree very well with North Korea," he said.
"We should be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results – completed rocket tests, helped free prisoners, and the remaining American soldiers returned home.
And he protected his unusual approach to the conversation about Kim's relations.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this whole arena, we'll have 200 people standing right here," Trip said, pointing to the crowd before him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
As a result of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they did not need.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population has been broken down, there has been no awareness of an elemental disadvantage, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge," said Mr. Sumbong.
Although "Save the Children" is a team that will travel to Palu, it is still not sure that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency's spokesman, said the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
In view of the earthquakes that continue to afflict Indonesia, the country remains hopelessly unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are not unusual in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of cheese to warn of tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best time, travel through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters are increasing the threat of logistics.
A disease ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of the victims of earthquakes has headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign was the improvement of old Indonesia infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and roads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Joko's administration in the eyes of the elections next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressure from the sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using swords, swords, and arrows and other old weapons.

The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is falling at 832
The number of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia was estimated at 832, the country's disaster agency announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell in earthquake with 7.5 force on Friday and caused fires with a height of 20 feet, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.

Cromwell's state of parliament became the most recent memory attack in the "recording of history" casino
Its persecution would be a poignant justice for its "taliban" destruction of a large number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as a "dangerous" and "the attempt to record history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the current state-of-the-state debate, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconoclast of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor issued by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the role of his predecessor, Thomas, in the past century.
The beautiful presentation of Cromwell's Sir William Hamo Torneycroft is proof of the 19th century’s thinking and part of the figure’s history for which many believe it is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people think, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defense of Parliament from extreme pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether that is a complete correct representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation back then, and Cromwell is an individually recognized figure that represents a part of that division.
His achievements as Lord-protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
Swinja killer split up and killed a Chinese farmer
Swine attacked and killed a market farmer in Southeast China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only after the claim "Juan", is a dead man with the skin arterial, covered in blood in a car near the market in Lippanshui in the province of Gizu, South China, announced Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig's farm is preparing to put vaccines on pigs' pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with a brother from nearby Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and opened the door of the neighbor’s pigeon.
He said that there was a large cup of blood on the chest.
Forensic investigation confirmed that the liver weight of 550 pounds split the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My brother's leg was bloody and broken," said the cousin, with the nickname "Wu," according to the headline in the evening news of Guayang.
The photo from the security camera showed Ivan coming into the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John nor to his brother.
The market manager reported on the evening news that pigs were closed to prevent other people's attacks while the police collected evidence at the site.
Ivan's family and market officials are alleged to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, and early cases of swine have been reported.
In 2016 a Swedish woman and her husband attacked their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical damage to the husband.
Ten years ago a 650-pound pig caught a big farmer to his tractor until his wife had thrown him out of the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was taken out of his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an activator.
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very jealous... they don't want to hurt anyone intentionally.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosary will bring an old rain in the southwestern part of the United States
As predicted, hurricane Rosa weakens as she moves through the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring rain floods in the northern part of Mexico and the southern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, hurricanes of category 1 of 5.00 hours east of the week and was located 385 miles south-west of Mount Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north in a week.
Meanwhile, depression is starting over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the South California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will start making a large drop north in the southern part of the United States.
Rose's gonna bring 10 inches of rain to Mexico's business on Monday.
Then, the tropical falls with the approaching depression will create heavy rains in the south in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause heavy floods, floods, and possible floods of land in the desert.
The great tropical fall will cause floods that in some places will be about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Maximum 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Inflammation caused by floods is possible because of the rapidly worsening conditions that lie on the frozen nature of the tropical rain.
Especially is it recommended that we not walk in the desert when possible by tropical rain.
The family rain may cause the cannon to become turbulent rivers, and the time with the grunts will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local native rain on parts of the South California coast.
It may be raining more than half a inch, which can cause rivers of rivers of sand and sandy roads.
This would be the first rain in the region of their winter season.
Temporary tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late in the week and early in the morning in the morning on Monday, before the rain will spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The family rain will spread into the "four corners" on Tuesday and will last until midnight.
In October there are intensive changes in the temperature everywhere in the United States due to Arctic ice, but the tropical borders remain high.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
A great example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be found in the US central parts of the week.
There are almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Misuri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moin, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to recreas and expand.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a warm beginning in October with high temperatures at 80 degrees south-east.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast points to the possibility of an in-depth temperature for the U.S. East and to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Kavano's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony on Thursday of the nominated Supreme Court candidate, Bret Kavano, and the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Cristina Blassi Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the inevitable political situation continued, with sponsors who stopped regular programs for conversion at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flyk, Senator of Arizona, concluded an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation on the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that it was 100% sure that Kavano understood her drinking and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavano, in the tragic testimony, said it was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen said, were watching him on Friday.
The company counted the average visibility of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulties with measuring people looking at the offices.
To show it better, it's a public with a great look like a football game in football or the prizes of the film academy.
Channel Fox News, clean drivers strongly attacked Kavano's appointment, led across all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the afternoon hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2,52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleke was a central figure in the fifth drama.
After the Republican office moderated its announcement that he would vote for Cavano, CNN and CBS cameras were arrested as protestors calling him on Friday morning while he was trying to get into the elevator for the hearing of the judicial committee.
He was standing with his eyes closed for a few minutes as he was crossed over, and all of that was transferred to CNN's life.
"They stand here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth about the country"?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flyk said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, there would be more to say during the committee's hearing.
The cable and radio-dry networks were all covering hours later, when the judicial committee had to vote to promote Kavano's nomination in the voting Senate.
But Flyk said he would only do that if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider charges against the nominations next week, which was asked by the minority democracy.
Fleke was convinced partly by the conversation with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Conns.
After talking to Kuns, and with several senators after that, Fleke made a decision.
Fleke's choice was significant, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to elect Cavano without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI investigation on charges against Kavano.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on the flag
Prime Minister Teresa May blamed the critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the future of the British national interests in an interview on Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May is attending the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingam, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "checkers" plan for Brigitte, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect loan costs is "totally absurd".
Shooting in Wayd Sims: Police arrested suspect Dieton Simson for the death of a sportsman at the state university of Louisiana
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayd Sims, a 20-year-old boxer of the state university of Louisiana.
Twenty-year-old Dean Simpson was arrested and brought to prison under a second-level murder charge, said the baton Rouge police department.
The authorities announced a video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the storm.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found the DNA of the Simpson, said the CBS WAFB partner.
After Simpson was questioned, the police reported that he had been shot in Wade and killed.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The pathologist's office of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was a shot in the head at the door.
The Department appreciates the unit for refugees from the state police of Louisiana, the crime lab of the state police, the South University police, and the citizens of the area for assistance they have given in the investigation that led to arrest.
The Athletic Director at the state university of Louisiana thanked the police for her "activity in seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6.6-step bacon grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the state university of Louisiana.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits by game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the state university of Louisiana, Will Way, said the team is "in shock" and "in shock" of Sims' death.
"This is what you care about without stopping," said the coach.
Volcano throws pepper on Mexico City
The blast from the volcano Popocapetel reached the southern settlement of Mexico’s capital city.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after its activity in the crater and 183 gas and oil emissions were registered for 24 hours.
The center was following more dads and hits.
Social media images show a thin layer of pepper on the cars in Mexico City’s settlement places, as is Sochimilko.
Geophysicists noted an increased activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goo has been active since 1994.
Police have dealt with Catalan separatists prior to the year of voting for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independent protestors had met with the police for public order and peace and after thousands had joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first year of the polling vote for defeating Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and colors right, creating dark areas of the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Later on the day, they also killed the firemen, and the police used the bullets to get the firemen out.
For more than a few hours, independent groups have called "There is no forgetting, no forgiveness," and on the other hand, union protestors have called "Long live Spain".
Forty - four people were treated for minor injuries suffered in protests, said the local press.
Tensions are still high in the region that wants independence, one year after Madrid characterised the referendum on 1 October as illegal, but the same was celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the outcome was small because of the fear of the people who objected to the rejection.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police violently tried to stop voting at the voting sites in the region.
Independent groups camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations of support from the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixteen and eight annual electrician Narciss Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes that Catalan has the chance to get independence.
"Last year we lived one of our favorite moments.
I watched my parents cry out for joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but tough victory of the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties were forced to maintain the dynamic year with many of their most famous leaders or in a self-elected progon or in prison waiting for a trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the consistent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording the protest for police support, said the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting all positive," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before the trial last year, announced that they would apply for the European Parliament's elections next year.
"To be a candidate for European elections is the best way to judge the regression of democratic values and the repression we saw from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after killing a car in the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after retiring from home in London.
The incident took place in Balinagard Cresent on Thursday, about 19.30 BST.
Detective Bob Blings said it caused the head damage and the city itself.
At one point he may have been shot by a gun from his car.
Menga's victory brought him the winning of Livingstone from 1 – 0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's First Ball for Livingstone provided victory
Advanced Livingstone set up the Rangers with Stephen Gerard's signature, with only two losses in 18 contests, as manager of the Ibros Club.
The case of Dolly Menga showed how significant it was when Gary Holdd's country wanted a level with Hibernian on second position.
Gerard's side remained unconquered in the first season of the season and will meet with the Harts leaders next week, behind which eight points remain.
Before that, Rangers will be housed at Rapid Vienna in Europe's League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues to be defeated in the division during six contests, and Coach Holt has not yet faced the threat of the replacement of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed the chance against the cruel guests
Holt's team had to take a long time before they gave him the floor, and their direction caused many of the Rangers problems.
Scott Robinson tried, but he pulled the attack around the floor, and then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away from playing with his head hit by Craig Halket over the floor.
The guests gladly let the Rangers play before them, knowing that they can create problems with the actions set out.
And that's the way the judge came.
Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingstone got an opening, Declan Gallager and Robinson together hired Menga, who just gave a bullet from the center of the six-year-old.
By that time the Rangers had dominated the ball's possession, but they couldn't break the domestic defense, so Holman Liam Kelly didn't play most of the game.
That scheme continues in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos is making a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to give the ball due to the involvement of the Ranger Golmen, Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another action in Livingstone.
Livingstone's six-year-old was constantly passing through and was constantly protected, while two requests for a pen – after Halket's opposition to Glen Middleton's replacement and one for a hand game – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" by Livingstone – Analysis
Alsander Lamont of BBC Scotland in the arena Tony Macaroni
Fun game and outcome for Livingstone
They were great, continuing to transcend the expectations of this upstairs path.
Their style and character of playing had barely changed after they returned to the top, but much of the credit went to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from his coming.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was exorbitant, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga was still holding Conor Goldson and Joe Waral ready.
The Rangers still missed their inspiration.
As they were once good under the leadership of Gerard, they are now living by the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the homes – and it was a little awareness of Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Colonia
There were smiles and blue sky on Sunday (September 29th) when Turkey's and Germany's leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan of Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO citizens.
They got worse because of the problems involving human rights, freedom of print and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Colonia to open a huge new game.
The city is the home of Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the station, but many supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurdy, are also clearer, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposite protesters portray the guest's share of the famous hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat of others.
Traffic accident on the road in Deptford: a bicycle driver died in a car crash
The Velosipedist died in a car crash in London.
The trial took place near the intersection of the streets Beheid and Evelyn, a traffic officer with a big hit in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and came to help quickly, but the man died in the accident.
The trial took place a few months after the death of another passenger in a traffic accident on the streets of Chajlders where the driver escaped, about a million of the attack on Saturday.
The Metropolitical Police said staff are working to identify the man and inform his family.
The road blocks are set and buses are moved and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Latrine Prison: Six policemen injured in a crisis · Global Voices
Six prison officers were injured in a man's high-security prison, reported from the prison office.
The conflict erupted at HMP Long Martin in Worcestshire about 9.30 BST a week and still lasts.
Specialists from the "Tornado" unit were brought to resolve the munitions, which include eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Police have been treated for minor injuries on the spot.
The prison spokesman stated: “A special trained prison staff was urged to deal with the current incident in the HMP Long Latin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and the police will be responsible for it and can spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartine has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous rebels in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison governor had received a medical treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, public order and peace police were called into prison to deal with serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with billiard ballasts.
The Rosary is threatened by Fenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with floods (may be useful for dry areas)
A recent tropical depression is going to strike Arizona, but it will probably happen immediately at the beginning of the next week when the remaining force of the Russian hurricane will pass through the desert-southern region, taking the risk of floods.
The State Metrological Station has already issued a warning of possible floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, so to the south and east of Nevada, South California and Yuta, including the cities of Fenix, Flegstaf, Las Vegas and South Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move on a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The state meteorologist at Fenix said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cycles kept a tropical storm status or depression in excess of 200 million Fenix since 1950!
Katharina (1967) was a hurricane over 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Centre for hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in the work of Arizona Mongolia.
Other areas of the desert south-west region, including the central parts of the Mountains and the Great Basin Mountains, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas of floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although rain is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to benefit because the western region is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Suspension Authority, nearly 40 per cent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, the route of the Rosary led to a country’s defenses everywhere on the South California island of Mexico.
Rosa, still with the strength of the hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of a maximum of 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north with 12 miles an hour.
The storm is coming in contact with landwater in the Pacific and shrinks.
Thus, rainwaters are expected in Mexico with a strong tropical storm in the afternoons or evenings on Mondays.
The rain in parts of Mexico can be intense and a significant risk of floods.
"There is expected rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with possible maximum 10 inches of rain," said weather.com.
Rose will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Juttaa until late evening hours on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected by Rosa or her remnants is many heavy rains in Lower California, Southeast Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," the state center of hurricanes said.
These rainwaters are expected to bring life-threatening floods and torrents of ravines, as well as landslides in the mountainous regions.
Attack in Midsamer Norton: Four Killed
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a broken wound in Summersett.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Exelzior Teresa of Midsamer Norton about 4.00 BST on Saturday.
She's taken to the hospital and is in a "stable" state.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in Radstok, the police said of Avon and Somerset.
The police asked if anyone had any photos on the cell phone from the case to get out.
Trump said Kavano "has endured the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The voice of the Kavano judge is a voice for rejection of the most absurd and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trip of the Assembly in Wiling, West Virginia said.
Trump said Kavano "has endured the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavano witnessed before the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally ignoring Christina Blassi Ford's accusations that he had made half an attack on her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford witnessed the hearing and her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the brilliantness, quality and courage" of Cavano that day.
"The positive vote for the Kavano judge is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal conditions in our time, a lawyer with a public service record without delay," he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President directly mentioned Kavano's nomination as he spoke of the importance of the presence of the republics of the early elections.
"A further five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trip said the Democrats have a mission to "response and prevent".
The first key vote for Kavano's nomination in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, the old GOP manager for CNN said.
Hundreds died in Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people have died, many have been taken from the huge waves that hit the beaches when the Indonesian island of Solavesi was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, reports the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Paulu on Friday when the walls of a 6 - foot - high [18 m] bridge hit the eastern coast, bringing many to safety and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5 earthquake, he hit tsunamis.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people still took their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately, so they became victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, BNPB's spokesman for the disaster relief agency in the city of Jakarta, said.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, drove cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people ran to the tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, destroyed and damaged bridges and a water-borne geometry.
Follow-up traumas continued to strike the coastal city on Sunday.
The earthquake series was heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Institute for Assessment and Application of Indonesia's Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the energy released from the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of the long, ten coast, can be strengthened by the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "missing" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found buried under the wall of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be increased along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Donghal, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the areas concerned.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday that it did not inform that the tsunami struck Palu, although the authorities said the defences came off at the same time as the warning was issued.
A amateur photo shared by social media can be heard by a man on the roofs of the building as it cries out unconscious, warning people down the street of the nearby tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall is crashing on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the picture immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a stop in power to cut off communications about Paul, pushing the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but refugees still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened only for help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo was planning to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
It's really bad.
As World Vision staff from Dongula arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees were asleep in burial places at their office hall, they walked through the streets of the desert, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even while relief groups began their efforts to start disaster relief efforts, some complained that foreign aid experts were being prevented from traveling to Palau.
According to Indonesian law, financial support, assets and foreign personnel can only begin to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"What the government will say, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can accept international assistance, but there is still no status'.
As the second night of Paul’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Friday, friends and families of missing ones still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracle that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
In the week the rescuers saved a woman who was taken under the pillow for two days with her mother's body to her.
Gendon Subbandono, the trainer of the Indonesian state paraglydism team, trained two of the missing paraglyders for Asian games, which ended at the beginning of the month in Indonesia.
The others who were in the Roa Roa, added Mr. Mandhe, were his students.
"As a senator in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional cargo," he said.
Mr. Gandon told how, when she began to circulate the news about the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paraglyders' community, he was desperate to send messages of WhatsApp to the protesters from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a dry spell, instead of a son.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 when they filled out the banknote at the "Newport of the Key"
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a worker in Brink's who added a banknote to "Newport on the street," according to Newport police station press release.
The driver of the car emptied the bank into the fun complex and prepared to fill it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarty in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "dried from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
The Witnesses noted more suspects as they fled from the crime scene, as stated, but the police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanya West: The rapper changed his name to Jay
Raper Kanya West changed his name to Him.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The society was once known as Kanja West."
Forty - one - year - old West carried his past and used the past for his eight album, which was published in June.
The change took place just before his visit to Saturn Day Night Live, where his new "Yandhi" album was expected to be published.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande on the show who had to give up for "emotional reasons," the director of the show said.
Although he uses it as a short note of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and that means 't'," said West at the beginning of the year, discussing his album's title with Radio Director Big Boy.
"What I mean is you, I am us, it is us.
Fleeing from Canaan, which means the only one, to Him alone, reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a story of what we are."
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Shawn Combs is known as Paf Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love (Love and Brother Love).
Former West co-rapporteur, Jay Zy, also uses his name with or without a short and all big letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises he won't use the military on civilians
Mexico's U.S. President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against civilians until the country reaches 50 years of bloody repression against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolko Plaza that "he will never use the military for the repression of the Mexican people."
The military shot at peaceful demonstrators at the platform on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at the time of the Lviving student movement in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is supposed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double funding for engineering intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of scientific intelligence, so the United States should double its research resources in the field, the investor and practitioners for AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the US government announced scientific intelligence, even though the US has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number 1 in engineering innovations by 2030.
"The creation of the engineering budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far away from the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in the engineering engineering," Li said.
The allocation of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will do it to the US, Li said in an interview for the CNBC Sunday.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Supersilities in the Scientific Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was released a month from Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, a director-general of Synovation Ventures, who invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, the University of Carnegie Melon was working on a science intelligence system that won the top ranked American dress player, and later was director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Google border in China.
Li are grateful for the previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the challenge of the Agency's robotics for further research projects in the defence and asks when the next competition will be, in order to help identify the following viewers.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to get state borders, Li said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working experts from universities to work on engineering in recent years.
Li said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of engineering.
"I believe that "green maps" should automatically be offered to doctors of scientific sciences on engineering," he said.
China's State Council issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Scientific Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Science Foundation finances people in academic institutions the same way that the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations spend money on US researchers, but the job quality is lower in China, Li said.
Last year the US Defence Ministry set up the Joint Engineering Centre, which should cover industry and the Academy's partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Private Committee for Engineering.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the initiative called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million annually in engineering research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that required the establishment of the National Commission for the Safety of Engineering had no activities for months.
Macedonians vote at a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people in Macedonia voted on a referendum on Sunday whether to change its name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a step that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its demands for membership in Europe and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to its territory and places its visa on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote on the referendum and the boycotting campaign would raise doubts as to whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum validity.
The referendum lawyer's question was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the yoke of the European Union because that means safer lives for all of us," 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make decisions.
To change the name, there is a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the figure was 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the past parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," 62-year-old Goose Tanevski, a vocalist in the capital city, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son, Dushko, gave their voice to the Macedonian referendum for a change in the country's name, which will open the country's way to enter NATO and European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
Before parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Cavadarkov was preparing a small scene and tables in front of the shimmers set by people who would vote for the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads on high, not from the back entrance," Kavardarkov said.
"We are poor countries, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which has a rate of unemployment of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that the result "yes" will be "a confirmation of our future".
The questionnaire, published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the necessary heading.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote weekly.
Of these, 70 percent will vote with yes.
To be successful, the output should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious impact of the Western government's policy after the government arrived in May last year.
Look: Sergeio Aguero of Manchester City passed the entire defense of Brighton for the Gol
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly defeated the defense of Brayton in the victory of 2 – 0 for Manchester City on the week of the Etishad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his fall look so simple in the 65th minute.
Argentinian attacker got an average in the field at the beginning of the sequence.
Soon it passed between three defense players in Brayton, before they entered the open field.
Aguero was then found surrounded by four greens.
About a defense player before he hit a couple of others on a six-year-old at Brayton.
Then he gave it to the left of it, to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first arrival to the six-year-old to return Aguero's ball, which with the right foot beat the brayton's goal, Matthew Ryan, with the only hit on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has foot problems," City's manager, Pep Gvardioola, told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you gave the gorilla at that time."
But the honorable advantage of "heavenly sons" gave Sterling in the struggle for Prime Minister League.
The ball came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brayton's territory in that game.
He sent a wonderful direct ball on the left side to Liroy Shane.
Shane touched her a couple of times before she took Sterling to the distant article.
The "heavenly Sons" attack brought the ball into the network before it went out.
Siti will fight Hofenheim in a contest of the League of Champions at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rainn-Nekar, Germany.
Chercher wants to play a player against Rockis.
Since Neshnells was eliminated from the playoff fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But the competitive Sherzer is always hoping to stop in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Roksis, but only if there are still requests for a playoff for the Rockis team, which run a competition in front of Los Angeles Dogers in the Western National League.
The Rockis team had at least a "joker" for a 5-2 hit Nishnels place on Friday evening, but they still fight to confirm their place in the first division.
"Even if it doesn't play anything, at least we will be able to fly by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any moment I'll encounter this year.
Why don't you want me to compete in that?"
Nishnells still had to announce a week’s start, but they were evidently forced to allow Sherzer to leave in that situation.
Sherzer, who's going to start 34 times, trained to fly on Thursday, and will normally spend the rest of the week.
Washington's right is 18 – 7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 straykaut-poins in 220 2/3 innins of the season.
Trip's Mitins in West Virginia
The President directly mentioned the situation about Bret Kavano's election to the Supreme Court as he spoke of the importance of the presence of the republics of the early elections.
"All we've done so far will be put on a cat in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big – I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Tramp continues, “You see these terrible, terrible groups of democracies, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to return their power by using all the resources available to them, seeing evil, innocence.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, when they're going to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "response and prevent".
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "frequency, evil, inexhaustible and false".
He mentioned Senator Diana Fainstein of the democratic order set up by the Senate's Court Committee, on behalf of which the public responded to calls for silence.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, no, I'll wait a little – it was a very bad speech of the body – the worst speech of the body I've ever seen.”
The labs no longer accept different ideas.
Those who express their opinion do not tolerate
When Momentum's activities in my local party voted against me, that was almost not surprising.
However, I am only the last of the members of the parliament of the labist party who has been told that we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My co-legislator Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The statement on the meeting of the Eastern Laborist Party of Nottingam stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the labist party, the Council meetings on Friday evening were just like that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of most meetings, but the promise of "failure, low" policy has been forgotten long ago, if it really has ever begun.
It becomes clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the labist party, and each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the party’s leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political thought began to expect me to completely change my mind and take a position that would never otherwise take them, regardless of whether it becomes a word for national security or for the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, it's a critical abuse of social media calling for judgment, a rejection of the central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed to me are usually political.
I have great fear of professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexual or racist abuses every day, but never give up.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this age in politics is that the level of abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the lab party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every demand for "untrust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes more serious.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not being so loud, and then "all will be fine."
But that's not why I came into politics.
Just 32 years ago, when I joined the labist party as a student, motivated by the lack of care of the Tacer government that literally left my school to fail, I fought to improve public services for those who needed them, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last elections.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to tell them is that when the country goes close to Braghitis that will damage households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to spend my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the lab party.
But I have a message that is not about Notingham Momentum, but for my voters, no matter whether they are members of the labist party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how judgmental threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will turn me away from sharing in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrous: Unconquered Air goes up
The two late points may have changed the final result somewhere, but there is no doubt that Earl deserves the triumph in this wonderful game of the day of the Scottish Empire in the ragbys.
They are now on the top of the table, the only winning side of the ten.
In the end, all owes to their superior defense, as well as to their better - used chances of carrying the household, and trainer Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested through our competitions so far and we're still unsatisfied, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Cristy of Melrous said: “The sacrifice for Earl, they used their chances better than us. ”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Climo, gave him the advantage of Earl, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the game of Wariors, enabled Melrous to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggott stole an unconverted point.
Climus extended the ER's leadership with a pen, in the past, just in the half hour, he reached a point, and he turned the salt point to get 17 - 5 for ER in the rescue.
But Melrous well started the second half, and Patrick Andreson's point, converted by Baggot, reduced the leadership of five points.
Then there was a long detention due to the serious injury of Rurid Nott, who was brought to the nose, and since the reboot, Earl has continued to struggle with the point of Stafford McDoual, converted by Climo.
Air's VD captain, Blair McFerson, then got a letter card and again, Melrous paid for the extra man with an unverified point at Bruce Colwin at the end of the time with unwelcome pressure.
However, the domestic team was back, and when Struan Hachinson received a letter card to collect climate without the ball, McFerson issued a quote from the line for the panels on the back of the fierce air attack.
Climo was converting, as he did almost again from the reboot, after Kyle Roy took David Armstrong's hit and sent the winged player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the team.
Still Game star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The "Still Game" star, Ford Kiran, seems ready to move into the supply industry after it has been discovered that it is named as the director of a licensed company restaurant.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in BBC's popular series, where he is a scanner and plays with a long-term partner in the comedy, Greg Hemfil.
The couple announced that the next nine season would be the last, and it looks like Kirnan's planning for life after Cregeleng.
According to the official records, he is the director of the Afförmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of Scottish Sun said Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glazgov's "winning restaurant".
"The sea is ours": Bolivian surrounded with a cloud hoping that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
The Navy patrols a hidden and lying marine seat in La Paz.
The public buildings have set up a marine son-in-law.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to come back."
Under the fall of Bolivia, the mention of the coast lost in the use of Chile in a 19th - century conflict of resources is still fresh, as is the gorge to swim back to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may now be the biggest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision on 1 October after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the moment, a spirit of unity and peace and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calssaya, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision taken by the international court of large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge in favour of Bolivia's prosecution, which, after decades of changing talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to allocate a sovereign exit to the Bolivian sea.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president with domestic origin, who faces a controversial fight for elections next year, is also quite dependent on the verdict on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said a solemnly at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge Bolivia for its benefit and that it will not even change much in its application.
The UN body with a seat in the Netherlands will not be able to assign Chile's territory and indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
What the International Court's verdict comes only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And in the last four years, they may have invented Bolivia's cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem with access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military retretrieval defeated the rest of Chile's good will, suggesting it.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a certain point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not had the exchange of Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Wellce, the Bolivian representative in Hag, rejected the idea that making a court decision is unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open up a good relationship with Chile" and the possibility "to put an end to 139 years of misappropriation with loan benefits," he said.
Calsania also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the sea problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should go beyond the past."
North Korea says she won't come to nuclear disarmament unless she can't trust the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Young Ho, says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep its promises during the summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary Mike Pompeo was on the task of restoring blocked nuclear diplomacy over three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Young Nun.
Ri says it's "fiction" to be considered that the continued sanctions and US sanctions for the declaration of the end of the Korean war will bring North Korea to a knees.
Washington is careful to agree with the declaration without Pioning first to take significant disarmament measures.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there's a lot of scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris’ fashion magazines reveal the latest line of massive hats that is on the way to the biggest sellers in your neighborhood
If you want to improve the size of your collection cap or completely block the sun, then don't continue.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of cut-off huge hats for their SS19 collection on the track that hid the style set at the fashion week in Paris.
In the end, non-practical hats launched the Instagram flight, and these designers sent out their creations that fall in the eyes of the track.
The park noted by Valentino was a huge run-out hat decorated with a wide range of beads that washed the head of the model.
The other big supplements included lemons with circuses, purple hats, and even ananas, but they're not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of trade masks, and at the same time for the night of witchry.
Many of the colorful masks had hair covered and represented more of Hannibal Lector than the high fashion.
One creature represented a navigational equipment full of eyes and a nozzle, and the other looked like a slow-run ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats can come to the shops near you.
The big hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", the shameless hat with a wide two-footed hat that they all carry from Riana to Emily Ratajkoski.
The culinary fashion house behind the very non-practical hat spread through the social media sent another big creature on the track, a broken beach bag with a size almost equal to the height of the model she was carrying.
The dark Portuguese Rafi bag, with a board of raffy and a white leather hand, was the part that was highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of James at the Modden Week in Paris.
The famous statistics, Luke Armitage, told F.
John Edward: Language Skills Needed for Global Citizens · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with yet another comprehensive outcome of the exams, which is only reinforced with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other communities.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement appropriate teaching programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired as a selected subject in schools.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it will make him feel good.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it will touch him in the soul."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot establish ourselves in English only when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent results of the survey, we can note that languages exceed all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved a higher score of 5+.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students achieved a higher "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who learned French and 63 per cent of those who also learned Spanish also reached "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly achieve in the future.
Languages now, as a selected object, are viewed at the same level as STEM-objects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the programs of independent schools as well as elsewhere.
The Commission's Employment and Skills Survey in 2014 noted that for the reasons that workers failed to meet jobs, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly demanding in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the ever - increasing demand for languages, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such experience.
The ability to communicate directly to people from foreign countries will automatically give the advantage of the pillar before competition.
According to YouGov's poll of more than 4,000 adults in the OC in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language they spoke more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
So investing in teaching languages is now important to children today.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to its language.
A number of schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in the world when they will be viewed in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be numerous languages that can be selected from independent schools, with professionals who are specialists in this field.
The Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed for success, no matter what the future may bring.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the country’s future, so this must be reflected in schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
"It must be done well" (it must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will lead Lakers to debate in San Diego on Sunday
The waiting is almost over for passengers who wanted to see Lebron James to start for Los Angeles Lakes.
Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, said James will play the first game in the week's presidential contest against Danver Nagets in San Diego.
But the minute it's gonna play, it's not yet decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Valton said on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers report, Mike Trudel, wrote a tweet that James would probably play a limited time.
After training from the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for the season of six contests before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the pre-session at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
South Virginia's Yu-Tub's Mitting Channel
President Donald Trump started a series of motions as part of the campaign tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five ordered missions to Trump next week, including visits to remote places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill an empty seat in the Supreme Court is in peace, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections between the mandate, because the republics can lose control at the Congress by voting in November.
How much time is Trump's tonight match in West Virginia, and how can you watch it over the Internet?
Tramp's match in Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 afternoon. A time zone on the east coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trip's migrating in West Virginia via the Internet with a live transmission to the Yu-Tub.
This week, it is likely that Trump will be inclined to listen to the man who nominated the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, who became a tennis player because of the charges of sexual misconduct with the expected delay of voting in the Senate for a week while the FBI's investigation continues.
The primary objective of the series of motions is to help the Republicans get a closure for the elections in November .
Since then, President Trump's campaign has said that these five minutes of next week are directed towards "intention of volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the Representative's House," according to Reuters.
"The control at the congress is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to the more associated countries at the beginning of the campaign's forced season," said a spokesman from the Trump campaign for Reuters, who refused to be named.
Prescribed in the Wesbanko arena in Wiling, tonight's contest can attract supporters from "Ohayo and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media", according to the news from West Virginia Metro.
On Saturday is the second trip to Tramp in West Virginia last month, in which he won more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains on the polls.
"It's not good for Morrisey that the president must come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hider, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: The U.S. team showed courage in the fight to keep the hopes of the start of individual contests in the week
After three single seasons, the four in the afternoon may have been just what they needed on the Cup Ryder.
The reverse of happiness is a completely formed sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of these conflicts are.
Who would say that happiness is now?
"They have led six points, and now they are four, so we have some luck assuming," Jordan Spit said at the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage of, of course, leadership from four points and twelve other games.
The Americans feel that they have a weak wind in the garden even though they have enough motion, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each reached three points of four.
Spit was great, and he was a good example.
These strong shouts of praise became all powerful during his game, with a key impact that led to the four-four-year-old balance when he and Thomas had two mistakes after two rounds.
His hit with the 15th match was expected with a similar call, so he tells you he believes the American team isn't out of the game.
"You just have to be serious and take care of your competition," Spit said.
That's all that each player has left right now.
18 points to reach the point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are French Mollinaires and Tommy Flytwood, the undisputed story of the Cup Ryder.
Strange, but a great part of Europe is four out of four and they can't make mistakes.
"Molivid" was the only couple without bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way they seem to go through their energy to and from this vocal group ensure that they are players that will win the week and that there will be no other popular players that will ensure a potential European victory when the sun goes behind Le Golf National, except Flytwood or Molinaire.
It's preferable to both at the same time on different points.
However, the talks about European celebration remain unfair.
Buba Watson and Web Simson were quick to deal with Sergeo Garcia, the morning hero of two couples, when he joined Alex Norren.
A broken strike and two of the first nine buried the Spanish and the Swiss in a hole that they never could get out of.
In a week, however, there's nothing that can help you get out of the hole.
The two couples and the four are so fascinating to look close because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they do not listen to, and the way the strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better than a team, and this led to significant leadership in the last day, but the four season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans led with 10-6 on the last day of the Reider Cup
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of the Cup Ryder after Sunday's leadership in two couples and four 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Flytwood and French Molinari led the two-win attack while Tiger Woods tried to take the lead to Le Golf National on four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, which fought to keep the trophies that he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team that had a lot of failures in the morning couple and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans fought more resistance in the four, winning two contests, but they couldn't get the lead.
Jim Furrick's team needs eight points of 12 individual matches a week to keep the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European beginner who won four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, called "Molivid", after the sensory weekend, are the second pair that won four points in the first four matches in the history of the Cup Ryder.
After "smacking" Woods and Patrick Reid in two pairs, they played well and won the built Woods and American beginner Brown Deshambu with an even more explicit score of 5&4.
Woods, who passed through two swords on Saturday, was currently playing excellent, but now he lost 19 of the 29 matches in two pairs and four and seven times in order.
Justin Rose, who was resting while the two couples were in the morning, returned as Henrik Stanson's partner in the 4th grade of 2&1 Dastin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not following their friendly, windy day in the south-west of Paris.
Tricycle Dominant Winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas have taken action on the Americans with two points a week.
They achieved a decisive victory of 2&1 over Spanish John Ram and Ian Pulter in the two pairs and returned later to defeat Pulter and Rory McCloy with 4&3 in four, but lost the first, two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Cup Ryder a certain team has been equipped with a lack of four points in an individual game, although as the holders of the title, the Furic team has had enough equal results to keep the trophies.
After two days, however, the weekly attack seems to remain over them.
North Korea says "no chance" to unify unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions broaden the confidence in the United States and that the country is not in a position to give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho told the World's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "a significant measure of good will" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear rocket tests, detonating nuclear testing facilities, and is committed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see an appropriate answer from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way of unifying ourselves first."
Although Ri reiterated the known complaints of North Korea against Washington's accession to nuclear disarmament "in the phase", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the transition steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pionjang had done in the past.
Ri was adjudicated at a joint statement by Kim Jong Nun and Donald Trip at the first summit of the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed security in North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war from 1950 to 53, but the United States claims that Piongyang has to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refuses to impose strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament first of all" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can not bend the knee is a crazy dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions expand our distrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader mentioned in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in in the last five months and added: "As far as the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end in such a mess."
However, Rey's speech tone was significantly different from last year's, when he said before the UN General Assembly that the orientation of North Korean rockets to the US is inevitable after "Mr. Bad President" Trip called Kim "raceter" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trip, which last year threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, much more than Kim thanked for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but she said that there is still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
In the afternoon, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "It takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pioning for the transition steps.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue completely and without exception until total, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea from 2006 to prevent the financing of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in Piongjang.
He met Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time he didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he was making progress, but he was denied from North Korea only after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea is bound to meet with Mun this month for the disarmament of a rocket building, as well as a nuclear complex, while the United States takes "relevant measures".
He said Kim told him "the appropriate measures" he asked for are the security guarantees that Trump gave them in Singapore, as well as a move towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students visit courses to get enough rest
A new university course in Harvard this year aims to teach all diplomats more sleep to fight the growing macho culture of learning with staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students of the world’s leading university often do not know anything when it comes to primary care.
Charles Cajzler, a medical professor at Harvard Medical School and a woman's specialist at Brigham Hospital, designed the course he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after holding a talk on the effect of a negative sleep on learning.
"At the end of a delivery, a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, last year?"
She said that no one, she never told her about the importance of sleeping--what surprised me," he said about the Telegraph.
The course that was first offered this year explains to the students the basis for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic results, and they also improve the overall quality of sleep.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students have a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The one-time course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a student home where students press coffee, teas, pastries and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how unsatisfying sleep affects the athletic results and the importance of the routine of beding.
On the other hand, participants learn how long - term sleep failure can increase the risk of heart and brain damage, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behaviour of the students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Chaizler.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and in addition modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of the student in the fight against stress, despair and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight loss, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to move into a diet, which makes them always hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaizler design the course after visiting one of his hours last year, in his first year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to invite all sub-diplomatics to complete a similar program before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Cajzler recommends that students consider setting up an alarm for when they go to bed, as well as for when they wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "soon light" that come out of electronic screens and LED light, which removes the circular rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's Gold Collects Gerard's People · Global Voices
Reingers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's attack sent Stephen Gerard's decisive team in violation of 1-0 in Livingstone.
Aybros' team wanted to register their first victory after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team brought the second defeat to the team of Gerard in 18 games as manager who left his team with eight positions behind the escaped leadership team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga was focusing seven minutes before the half-life, and Reingers' position lost inspiration and chances of balance.
Now the Rangers fell to the sixth place, and Livingston fell to the third and was just behind the Hibernian according to the difference in his head.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after the linear judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical assistance because of his head injury after he was apparently hit by a remote object.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that passed Air in the semi-finals of the Betford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was playing with the 11 of Livingstone who won a point with Harts last week and would be happy in the way his well-extended position burned the opponents at every chance.
Rangers may have dominated the property over the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball than they did.
They should have reached the point, two minutes after the start of Manga's first game, when Scott Pittman went to Alan McGregor's head, but the middle-class player missed the chance.
Then the attack from Kihan Jacobs' distance reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgou could only play open in the defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed that there was more hope than faith in their game in the last three years.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should get a pen in the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Loules were judged, but Judge Steven Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian complaint.
Rangers managed to achieve only two shots to the floor in the first half of the year, but the former Golmen of Aebros Liam Kelly didn't strike with the head of Lasana Kulibali and the weak hit of these Edaria.
Although the beginning of the 34th minute of Livingstone may have been opposed during the game, no one can deny that they deserved their game.
Reingers failed again to deal with Jacobs' strike.
Scott Alfred didn't react when Declan Gallager added Scott Robinson's ball, who with a smooth head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-life when she replaced Kubalali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a rapid effect when the screen player passed Morelos, but impressive Kelly reacted from her blockade line.
But Livingstone managed to attract the host players to play the type of game they enjoy, while Litgou and Haqqet took a lot of the long additions.
Holt's team could have extended the lead to the end of the game, but McGregor was well set up and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head on the corner.
Reingers' replacement, Glen Middleton had another request for a pen since it happened to Jacobs, but Thompson didn't accept it again.
Almanah: The Fascist of the gay number
And now a part of our German "In the Week of Tomorrow": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and ODBROYUME ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which led to the creation of the device known as the gay number.
Since then, it has become a major obstacle to science, the gay thinker has become a major obstacle to popular culture, such as in the 1950's "Colorado's Evedian" film, where scientists, cowboys, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, have appeared incredible:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: “It’s a gay number, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your ears, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans says, "I'm sure it's going to jump now!"
Hans Gaiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" deleted cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the removed cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize removed cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from patients and their changes in laboratory
You can see protein honour in many cancers and then be returned to the organism.
The test vaccine provides promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
To a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the removed cells, the ovaries' arm has disappeared for 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immunological cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so that they can "see" protein parity in many types of cancer called HER2, and then their return to the organism.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer of Betezda, Meriland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "incentives the growth of several types of cancer", including cancer of the cities, ovarians, white tombs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach with the removal of immunological cells from patients and their "learning" to target cancer cells works in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Canja West made a pro-Tramp fall, wearing a hat with his moto, after going up on Saturday night alive.
It didn't go well.
Kanje West was noted in the study during a live show on Saturday evening, following an unsound step in which US President Donald Tramp said he would apply for a function in 2020.
Following the release of the third song that evening, called the City of Spirits, where he wore a hat with a sign to make America Glory Again, he began to criticise democracy and reiterate his support for Trip.
"Many times when I talk to someone, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd be leaving America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday, the evening show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star was laughing at Bret Kavano's testimony to the Senate's legal issues commission, related to the allegations of a sexual assault on Christine Blaise Ford.
Although not posted, West's western photo was posted on social media by Commissioner Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to laugh at West with the statement.
West also appealed to the public that it was hard to go behind the scene because of his hat.
"They made fun of me in front of the scene.
They told me, "Don't show up with that hat."
They're laughing at me!
Then they told me I'm in the basement, he said, according to Washington Exeminer.
News continues: "Do you want to see the underworld?" She said she'd put her superman button, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try with love."
His comments attracted the audience's surprises at least twice, and the evening show team seemed embarrassed, reports Varajetti, a man said to the publisher, "The whole studio takes us."
News was brought as a replacement at the last moment for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boy, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
The news surprises many with the performance of the song "I love it," dressed as a Perier's squeal.
News received support from the leader of the TPSAD Conservative Group, Kendis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the most powerful spirits: you're blagodaram who's being set up by the TPSAD. ”
But the show's host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was hers and that's absolutely beautiful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "study") for what I believe to accept and spread ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we." she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, while he is now "formally known as Kane West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Didi, also known as Paf Daddy, Paf and P Didi.
The fellow rapper, Snup Dog has the name Snap Lion and of course the famous music legend Prince, changed his name into a symbol, and then into an artist of the past known as Prince.
Indictment for attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he shot a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Baliahkmore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the High Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor.
The star of the Trino's game series, Kit Harington, attacked toxicity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a major matchmaker like John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series of the Tronov games.
But the actor, 31, attacked Maco-hero's stereotype, when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be firm to be respected.
In a statement on the cultural part of Sanday Times, Kit says he believes that "something's wrong" and asks how to deal with the issue of toxicity in #SegaKajam's area.
Kitt, who recently married to the star of the Tronov game, Rosie Lesley, also 31 admitted that there are "strong feelings" on that issue.
"I personally have strong feelings at the moment - where did we mistake the man?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we now see?"
Kitt believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxicity, thanks to strong male figures.
He continues: “What is sown, and what does it bear?
What do you learn from TV and on the street, what makes young men feel they have to have a certain side of the man?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because it's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the continuation of the Tronos game when the series ended next summer, saying that "he ended with battle and horses".
Since November, Kitt will be re-entering the true West of Sam Shepard, who is told about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that what he had met with his wife, Rose, was the best thing that came out of the Tronov game.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me a future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose was playing the game, a guy who had a loving attachment to Kit's face, John Snow, in the fantastic series that Amy won the prize.
The couple were married in June 2018 to Lesley's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% growth in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 880,000 are occupied in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, which has changed over the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of blood transfusion.
But the number of people infected with HIV this way is reduced to almost zero, China's health authorities said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
From year to year, however, the number of those who live with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was determinized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is great.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to inappropriate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Watters rejects the data from a staff member associated with a Senator of the Republican Party as "dangerous lies" and "debt theories"
U.S. President Maxine Waters rejected charges on Saturday that a member of her staff posted personal information to three republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia's legislative pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles believed that claims were "ultra-right" sympathies and web-locations.
"Lagues, lies and even more disgusting lies," Wutters said in Twitter's statement.
The published information is said to include home address and phone numbers of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hech from Yuta.
Information was posted on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the Senate panel heard accusations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavano, appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The information presented appeared shortly after the Qavano was questioned by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redsteit announced that the IP address identifying the source of the statement is linked to Waters' office and information about a member of Waters' staff was published, Hill said.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and represent absolute lies," Wutters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of these false and false accusations - is in no way responsible for the information presented.
The unfortunate charges are completely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism from the Internet, including the former Secretary of the White House's press, Ari Flejcher.
"These denials are nervous," Fleisher wrote.
"This shows that she has no temperature to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something that he has not done, he should not be offended.
He shouldn't be challenged.
He shouldn't ask himself about the motive of the prosecutor.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher seemed to compare Watters' reaction to democratic criticisms related to Judge Kavano, who was accused of critics because he seemed too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate who was asked to replace Waters in the middle of the mandate's elections, also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, that's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Watters said that her office informed “the relevant institutions and police about false claims.
"We will allow the offenders to be found," she continues, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all my staff."
The idea of John Inglesh Attack Again - Undercovered the Spanish lies of Rowan Atkinson
Now it is traditional to look for the elements of Bragzit in every new British-related film, and that seems to be relevant for this renewal of the French franchise of the fake, action comedy Joni Ingleish - which started in 2003 with Johnny Inglesh and reborn in 2011 with Johnny Inglesh: reborn.
Will the careful self - examination of how clearly we are going to be able to make a new export opportunity for the nation?
However, the face with great eyes and a lot of grunts of the incapacitated John Inglesh got the license to "hold" the things on the second time - his name first of all means that he is a comical creature with a wide cover, made for viewers in the cinema in places where he doesn't speak English.
He's certainly a shadow of a secret agent who, despite his sincere efforts for a careful glamour on the way to Kluzo, has pictures of Mr. Bin and a part of the boy who played a note from the song Kochii on the fire from the Olympic Games opening ceremony in London 2012.
His foundation is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who has ever been running into Barclay's forgotten TV advertising, leaving chaos behind him.
There's one or two points in Johnny England's latest edition.
I like it very much when Johnny Inglesh approaches a helicopter dressed in a middle-aged boat, and the rotor's wheels hit his back.
The gift of Atkinson for a physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially because "serious" film brands such as 007 and the impossible Mission and themselves contain elements of a comedy.
The humor seems to have been replaced for children, instead of for adults, and for me, Johnny Inglesh's misfortunes aren't as exciting and focused as they're missing the time of a Bin of Atkinson's character.
The whole thing is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
cyber hacker has infiltrated into the super secret network of spies in Britain, discovering the identity of all British field agents, disappointed by the agent who is in charge -- disappointed little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pacifist and a fighter figure and already suffering from a total storm of political instability: Emma Thompson is giving himself this picture of the quasi-Terez-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario that would work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling itself Johnny Inglesh who now works as a private school teacher, but "black" gives hours for secret agents: there are a few good guys here when England offers a school for spying that represents a rock academy.
English is quickly invited to Whitehol's emergency briefing and reunited with former co-operation Bou, who plays Ben Miller.
Bou is now a married man, in relation to a submarine commander, a comical role in which Vicki Peperdin has not been used well.
Well, Betman and Robin, to break up all the things in the Royal Secret Service, they return to action and they finally meet the beautiful Ophelia Bouletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the dangerous influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: evil Jason Walt, a member of the Jake Lacey.
England and Bou begin their impression of absurd actions: they are transformed as fans to burn a French restaurant; they make a vacation after they cross the luxury yacht of Volta; and England begins the right anarchy when they try to use a cassie for virtual reality to meet the insides of Walt's house.
All the horses were removed for the last sequence, but as kind and loud, there's a lot of child TV in the whole movie.
It's a nice-looking thing.
And as with other films with Johnny Inglesh, I can't think of it: can't the British film industry give him the role of Rowan Atkinson who's gonna use his talent?
Laburists deny that the British plan to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's labist party will think of a radical plan that the British will work for four days a week - but will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to use the savings they make with the engineering to give the workers another day of freedom.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "records" with the party's economic agenda and with the country's plans to be dismissed by the workers.
The past four-day work week is supported by the Syndicate Congress as a way for workers to gain income from changes in the economy.
A high-ranking party member said of Sanday Times: “The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a work week of four days is a stress that is consistent with the party's approach to the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Laborist Party will not be the first to adopt such an idea, the Green Party was charged for four-day working weeks during the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the ambition has not been accepted by the entire lab party.
The Laburist Party's portfolio said: "The four-day work week is not a party's strategy and the party does not consider such an idea."
Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Laburists conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to seize the power of "directors without face" and "profesors" in municipal companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies can not get back the whole part because the Laburist government could make "dedications" because of unethical behaviour.
He also confirmed the plans for employees to be part of the company's boards and to create inclusive property funds with 10 per cent of private companies' capital belonging to employees, which will be able to buy an annual dividend up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy makes a statement about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation for Cavano can translate them
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Bret Kavano has suspended the final vote for his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least one week and updated the question of whether the bureau's openings might consider some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview published on Sunday, the representative of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them think.
Kennedy was opened from his South Carolina chair.
"I think it's okay," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, determined, unintended."
Graham's voice, however, looks like a heavy stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Kavano and there is a shocking charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret refused to be energetic," said Graham, thinking of Christine Blaise Ford.
"All that she named them could not be confirmed.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens, and did you do something to reduce poverty?
This week in New York will hold the Festival Global Citizens, an annual musical event that includes famous stars and has an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now being held seven times, and the Global Citizens Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the big tree in the central park, not only to enjoy on-the-spots such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (except if they do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), participants must perform several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, telephone call, or other useful work that will help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizens been since they were 12 years old?
Is the idea of free concert really a way to convince people to want something or just one more case of "click-activism" - people who feel that they make a real difference with signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed that more than 19 million "activities" have been registered by supporters, who have worked for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped world leaders to identify commitment and strategies that have collected more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and notifications resulting from their activities, 10 billion of which have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the total funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Food Power, the partnership of investors and implanters, with a seat in Britain dedicated to "helping children to use their potential," which promises to provide $35 million for Rwanda for assistance on the lack of food in the country after receiving 4,700 messages from Twitter from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of Britain, donors, national governments and Global Citizens alike, we can make social injustice of malnutrition, a record in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Food said, before the elected people of the London concert in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities were taken in connection with calls to improve the food of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, the Food Power, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritive interventions.
How do you answer one of the frequently asked questions on their website "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
“ It will be a long and difficult journey, ” said a global citizen. “ We will never succeed.
But, like the big civil and anti-apartthead movements in front of us, we'll succeed, because we're strong together.
Janet Jackson, Wikkend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Janel Mona are some of the artists who are going to attend this annual event in New York, whose host will be Deborah and Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the moratorium for "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports - Ministry of Internal Affairs
Washington may "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, found US Interior Minister Ryan Zinki, as Washington Exeminer quoted.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria - namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government - is designed to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is because of the energy market, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the maritime roads will remain open and as long as it is necessary to block their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki has been invited to the events organized by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group that represents itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continues to compare Washington's approach in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, a rise in fuel input and replacement," he said, while speaking about Russia as "an inappropriate point" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement followed after the start-up mission of the Trump administration to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas in Europe, replacing Russia, which is a very useful option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trip's administration, including American President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "independence" project on the North Tek 2, which according to Tramp, from Berlin has made Moscow a "debtor".
More and more times, Moscow has pointed out that North Tek 2, which is worth 11 billion dollars, should double the current capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the strong opposition of Washington to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure-free tool and that customers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after the meeting with American Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attitude was opposed by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party engages in our energy acquisition," said Dieter Kemf, the first man of the German Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Varen "will carefully review" whether to apply for president in 2020, Senator of Massachuszez said
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "will carefully consider" whether to apply for president after the middle of the mandate.
During a meeting in the city congregation in Holíok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our non-functional government, which means a woman's head," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider whether to apply for president."
Voren evaluated President Donald Trump’s work during the meeting in the city congregation and said that he “leaded the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open to her criticisms against Trump and the man he designated as a judge in Supreme Court, Bret Kavano.
In Twitter's message on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her election unit believe that she should not apply in 2020.
Fifteen and eight percent of the "probably" voters from Masachusec said the senator should not apply, according to the study of the Center for Political Research of the University in Saffolk/Bostonski Globe.
Thirty per cent and two per cent support such a candidate.
The questionnaire showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting potential nominations, and 48 per cent against.
Other well-known names from the democratic party for which the nomination was discussed in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Baiden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he'd officially decide by January, according to Associated Press.
Sara Peylin speaks of the post-war syndrome of the Turk Peylins at Donald Tramp's Mitting
Trek Peylin, 26, has been in Iraq for a year after his arrival in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"With what my son has gone through, what he has been through since he came back, I know how other families who have been scattered because of the horror syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are returning," she said before the audience of the interviewing for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peylin called the arrest "solon in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "they return a little different, they return conscripted, they come back and ask if there is any respect for what they and their airmen have done, and every other member of the army has given it to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence with assaults on women, along with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennet, police station in Vasila.
18 United States and Washington Supporting New Asylum Policy
Twenty-six federal states and the city of Washington support opposition to the new American policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing from domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and Washington submitted petition to the court on Friday in Washington as support of an asylum seeker who is opposed to politics, reports En-Bi-Si New.
The entire name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace vs Parliament, which the American Union of Civil Liberties imposed in August against federal policy, has not been found.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang," abused her, but the American authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was locked in Texas.
The state defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from where a large number of asylum requests are due in the United States, such as countries with persistent gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy undermines the 2014 Board's decision on immigration complaints that allowed undocumented immigrants who run from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Public lawyer in Washington Carl Rosen said on Friday that the new policy " ignores a decade of bringing laws at the level of the United States, federal and international levels".
"The federal law requires all asylum requests to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the application and such a provision violates that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, advocates of the letter claim that immigration policy is harmful to the American economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary labour force".
Public prosecutor Jeff Sashns ordered immigration courts not to give asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There are still asylums for those leaving a country of origin because of prejudice or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Sashns said when he presented the policy on 11 June.
The asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all problems -- even all serious problems -- with which people around the world face every day.
A desperate effort is being made to save Paul because the number of victims has doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's a lot tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, as she spent her son's baby in an evacation center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes and pick up their items they have set up in order to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has bone and shoulder fractures, were resting in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside, due to the frequency of successive smaller earthquakes.
Solzy found it in his eyes when he described the powerful earthquake in the hotel room of the fifth floor in which he and his wife and daughter were living.
"There was no time to save.
I was forced into the walls of the wall, so I think," said Harris about Assyanied Press, adding that his family was in the city because of a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, but then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
The American ambassador accuses China of "malterrection" with "propagandized ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper announced a statement on four pages in an American daily newspaper, estimating the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, an American ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Tramp last Wednesday spoke about China Daily's payroll in De Moin Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after China accused China of joining the American elections for the 6 November Congress, China rejected the charge.
Tramp's claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in the American elections meant that it was close to U.S. Reuters, a new phase in Washington's educational campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising on trade promotions, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a trade war in which they measure import tariffs with each other.
China's ambitious tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were directed to exporters from the United States like Ayova, which support the Republican Party of Trip, confirmed by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and an ex-Ayova long-term governor, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in De Moin Register's weekly edition, "now doubles the abuse of propaganda in our free press".
"Before the propaganda decadence, China's government misuses the non-American tradition of free speech and free media with advertising in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the nearby press station, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of ideas and you will not really see the desperate thoughts that the Chinese people may have about China's problem economy, because the media are controlled by the strong hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his offer of advertising" at the column, although he didn't say who the newspaper was saying.
Republicans abstain from women's votes before the middle of the mandate, due to the debate with Kavano, warn analysts
Since many Republicans do not regard or defend Bret Kavano's nomination in the Supreme Court and despite several allegations of sexual assaults, analysts warn that there will be negative effects, especially from women in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already made it clear that they want to continue voting.
Of such things there is no return," wrote Grant Richer, professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he was doubting that the pressure on the FBI's investigation of Senator Jeff Flyk (Republic of Arizona) would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jan-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, in front of the Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators called "November is coming!" in protest at the Senate hall, when the republics, who have control of the Commission on Legal Affairs, decided to continue with the nomination of Cavano and despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, told Mike.
"Emotion and motivation of democracy will be high," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-participative political analyst on the news site.
“People already say they're tall; that's right.
But they may be higher, especially among independent female voters in the front and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which her sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court candidate were detailed, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if the Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, according to the news of En-Bi-Si, said last week.
"It's not only about voting in the commission or the last vote or whether Kavano is going to listen, it's also about the way the Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," said Guy Cessil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps in the election of democracy, about the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided on who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Cavano, although a larger number accept the first side.
A new Yu-Gov poll shows that 41 per cent of the researchers are definitely or likely to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they definitely or probably believe in Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent said that they think Kavano probably or definitely lied to the witness, while only 30 percent think the same about Ford.
After Flyk's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one more, of Debra Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate's Legal Affairs Commission, under oath, last week that Kavano was attacked in a drinking situation when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the court’s appeal to the Supreme Court showed the Genitals at a party while they studied in the 1980 ’ s.
The World Network's Superintendent Plans to Start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Ley, the World Network's observatory starts with an early business that claimed to be a Fisbuck, Amazon and Google rival.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company that is built on the platform with an open code of Solid, by Berners-Lie.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lie joked that Inrupt's purpose is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "data storage" or short-term POD.
It can include lists of contacts, lists of tasks, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drew, Microsoft Autollusc, Slek and Spotify all available to one viewer at the same time.
What is unique to the personal data storage of the Internet is that only the user depends on access to certain types of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
The idea of Inrapt, according to the executive director of the company John Bruce, is the company to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lie, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmes with a contract for the work of the project and a co-codici-volontere community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available to Inrapt's website.
Berners-Lie said he and his team are not talking to "Fiesbuck and Google about whether to make a complete change where their business models are completely turned around by night.
"We don't want their permission."
In a press release on Saturday, Berners-Lie wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lie transformed the Internet based on the Consortium of the World Institute for Technology in Massachusetts.
In the past, Berners-Lie was an influential speaker in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Lie will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm a big optimist for the new age on the Internet," added Berners-Lie.
Bernard Van: A famous winner of the Victorian Cross of World War I · Global Voices
The only priest of the Anglican Church who received the Victorian cross during the first world war as a warrior has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received recognition on September 29, 1918 in an attack by Bellengles and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed by the shooter four days later and never knew he had received the highest British military representation.
A comemotic stone was discovered from his two paramedics in Rasden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it's a "unbelieving symbol" what the stone was discovered 100 years after his grandfather got the performance.
According to the London newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Sen-Kentin "With a lot of gas, and under a powerful fire from ball and mitales."
He later ran to where he was shot and with “the greatest courage” he went ahead, before he attacked a ball iron and failed three of his servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German soldier on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's work was "something I know I will never be able to do, but it's something that doesn't make sense."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a vein after the parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said "it is a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown with the support that many people will give."
Fans of combined fighting skills remained awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead they got Pope Prace
Imagine, you're awake all night to see Belator 206, and you don't have a chance to see the main event.
San Jose's list contained 13 battles, including six with the main map shown all night in Britain on Channel 5.
On the 6th morning, just as Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in Britain were surprised when the channel moved to Pepa Prasse.
Some have not been impressed since they were awake to the early hours of the war.
One of Twitter’s fans described the transfer of a child’s black file as “a sick joke. ”
"The law was so inappropriate that on 6th morning it had to be transferred to a child programme," said Dave Schwarz, Belator's vice president for marketing and communication when he was asked to transfer.
"Pepa porsa," yes.
The president of the company Belator Scott Cooker said they will work on a schedule that will include future viewers from Britain.
"I think that when I think about resuspending, I think we can probably find a solution," Kocker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution on Sunday by our time, and Monday by their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages when we moved, and no one's been good-looking.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you he won't come back.
We're going to limit the number of five, instead of the number six -- as we usually do -- we tried to send more for the fans and we went.
It's an unfortunate situation.
desert discs: Tom Daily felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daily says he grew up feeling frustrated because of his sexuality -- but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to high school that "all aren't like me."
Speaking at the first radio island's radio 4, presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he talked about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope."
He also said that what became a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular president of the long-term show of Kirsty Yang took several months' rest due to illness.
Acting like a similar figure in Lavern's first program, Daily said he felt "less" than anyone else while he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, those feelings of low value and differentiality were the things that gave me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that everyone would not be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The Olympics with two bronze medals became known as the backbone of the LGBT campaigns and used their approach to this year's Communist Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to determinize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly and want to give others a “hope. ”
The threefold World Championship said about the love of a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lens Black, who met him in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Daily concluded a marriage with the obstetrician, who was 20 years old, last year, but said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much of an early age" - he went to the first Olympics at 14 years of age, and his father died three years later - he said it's hard to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar heights and depth.
They became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Deeley, and Daily said "all his views" were changed.
"As long as you asked me last year, everything was connected to "I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are important things from the gold medal at the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily, he said that his father did not accept his death as one of the last things he asked them if they had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to attend the first class.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't be here to be first," he said.
"I held my hand when I stopped breathing and when I actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized it was hopeless," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about all my life - to jump in front of the household audience of the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of a song - pride by Heder Smol - who turned to his head in preparations for the Olympics and who was still playing.
Bi-Bi-Si Radio 4 desert discs are on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michaelson, if not in shape, was at the club during the Cup Rayder on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will put a record on Sunday when he will play the 47th Cup Ryder competition, but he will have to change the shape to avoid an unhappy transition.
Michaelson, who plays on the biennial event, recorded 12 times, was sent to the club by Captain Jim Furrick during the Saturdays' two pairs and four.
Instead of being at the center of attention, as the United States often represents, the fifth winner, he spent time in playing and practicing his game, on the average, hoping to fix what he was doing.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the tough Le Golf Nazional game, where the remote roughies were regularly punished in ignorance.
And unless the territory itself is not scary enough, Mikkelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, is facing the precise champion of British Open Frankesko Molinari, who plays in pairs with beginner Tommy Flytwood to win in all four matches this week.
As long as the Americans who lack four points before 12 individual competitions begin to be difficult, Michaelson's game can be judged.
Furic expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched me on his back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
"He has a lot of self-reliance on himself.
He is part of the celebrants and has been given much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine how he played two games.
I was thinking more, but that's what we went through, and we thought we had to do that.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Michaelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played games at the Cup Ryder on Sunday.
This could be the end of the Cup Ryder career where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven half, although Furic said his presence carries something indiscriminate in the team.
He's funny, he's shaky, smart, he wants to joke with people, and he's a great man at the team meetings," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun in the game with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain of experience, knows that considerable leadership in front of individual competitions in the last day of the Cup Ryder can easily turn into a non-profit.
The Danish argued on a competition in Valdrema in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Balesteros had five points in front of the Americans, but "he crossed the line of purpose only with the trains", with the smallest lead of 1411⁄2-131/2.
"I remind myself that we had a great leadership in Valdrema; we had a great leadership in Brooklyn, when we also lost Valderama, when we won for a while," said Bjorn, the picture, after seeing the 2018 class won 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 on Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Go get ready for tomorrow.
Get out and play as you need.
This is not done all the time until the competition ends.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophies, and the focus remains on it.
All the time I say, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opposite side -- the best players in the world."
He added: “I don’t want to give too much attention to that question.
The breakfast game is a different star.
The next day, we are expected to play personal games, and that is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, they test all the skills as a golf player.
It's the message that should be sent to the players, to give of themselves tomorrow.
Now, you leave the partner and he should give everything to himself."
Unlike Bion, opponent Jim Furic will ask players to play better individually than they played in two, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furic himself was at the end of the last day's change, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe took out "The miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when asked about how Ben Krensou, the captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment comes in a certain direction, it has a lot of pressure on the middle of the competition.
We set the line accordingly and the team order is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Tomas has been commissioned to oppose first and face Rory McClroy the most important competition, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flytwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important part of the series.
"I decided to go this way with the guys because I think we're going to cover it up," Bionn said about the choice in individual games.
The new German warship has been relocated
The latest flag of the German Navy was to be sent in 2014 to replace the old warships from the time of the Cold War, but that will not happen until next year because of the wrong systems and growing prices, local media reported.
The launch of the "Rainland-Falc", the lead ship of the new class frigates Baden-Vietmberg, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Cate, calling for a military passport.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problem issues after the shipment prevented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Vietmberg class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the old frigates from the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful ball, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and marine rockets, as well as some steel technology, such as a smaller radar, infrared and acoustic track.
Among other important features is proper maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from home facilities.
However, the constant delay means that modern warships - which should enable Germany to have power over the oceans - will be already advanced as they enter the ministry, notes Di Cate.
The F125 strike came to the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blom and Vos brothel in Hamburg.
That was the first time the mariner came back to the ship of the shipwright after release.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a large number of key "software and hardware defects" due to which the warship was useless when sent to a battle mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Vietmberg class ships will have a crew of about 120 mariners - only half of the old class frigates' crew in Bremen.
It also appeared that the ship is more attractive than the planned weight that reduces its performances and restricts the marine capacity to add building to the future.
Rayland-Falz weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice the weight of the ships of a similar class used by Germany in the second world war.
In addition to the problem hardware, the cost of the entire project - including training of the team - also became a problem.
It is said that it has reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - an increase from the start of €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are particularly important because of the warning of Germany’s reduced maritime force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartles, head of the German Parliament defence committee, confirmed that the Navy "rescinds ships that can be set up."
The representative said that the problem had deteriorated over time because the old ships had been withdrawn from service, but they had not been secured for replacement ships.
He complained that none of the frigates from Baden-Vietmberg's class can join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Lying
A new research is being carried out in the Scottish mountain slopes to find out how the lions use their prey in the search for food.
There is hope that the discovery will provide answers to the conduct of the unique flight shoes and will help with the management of future protection activities.
The study of the Scottish National Trust scientists will follow the usual and early-lyings, as well as the long- - eardrum and doubent linguists in the Invervo Gardenes in West Ross.
Special photographers will be placed at key locations around property to monitor the activities of the lions during the season.
En-Ech-Es staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of sound from all photos will determine the frequency depending on the type of tapes.
Then a map of living cells will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior on the surface.
Rob Devar, Natural Protection Council in En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of living are the most important for lions and how each species uses them.
Such information will help to determine the benefit of managing the habitats, such as the creation of libads, and how best to maintain forests for lions and other related species.
The population of lions in Scotland and Britain has fallen significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects the law and the loss of living quarters.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as well as the thick mud legs and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
In fact, the lilys aren't hidden.
Yet, because of their hunting habits, their ears are more sensitive than their eyes when it becomes a word to catch a bird.
They use sophisticated echo-location technique to find the insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, who cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important buildings and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, understands the lilys very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, night inspection, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even boasts the first and only reserve for links in Scotland to the property of Triv in Damfris and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says property is an ideal territory for them.
"We have a great area for lions here in Triv," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good living quarters.
But there's a lot of unknown things about liers, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us learn more about what they need to progress."
He points out that it is important to check whether there are links before refurbishing property because the unconscious destruction of bed can destroy up to 400 women and young people, and destroy the entire local population.
Lyings are protected and illegal to kill, torture, or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferel, a Scottish servant in Trust for the Protection of Lilies, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about lions and about other species, but we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejected rape charges, and the lawyers will charge the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called charges for strengthening "false news," and added that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will charge the German magazine Dr. Spigel, who filed charges.
Portugal's attacker and Juventus is accused of rape by the Americans, named Catherine Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid $375,000 to avoid the incident, reported Dr. Spigel on Friday.
Speaking on a video live on Instagram of its 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, rejected reports as “false news. ”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was brought out today is false news," the winner of the gold ball said in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with remembering my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and it's all right" added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to accuse Dr. Spigel of the charges they called "unacceptable transfer of doubts from private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc said the player will seek damage because of "the moral damage that corresponds to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
Apparently, an incident involving the charges took place in June 2009 in a hotel and a Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her by chance, according to documents submitted to the Clark court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 per cent" "good boy", but left under that "one per cent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries to the hospital, but later she agreed to an agreement without a court party because she was afraid of revenge" and was worried "that she would be publicly ashamed."
The 34-year-old says he wants to change the deal now because there's trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join the Real Madrid of Manchester Union when the alleged attack took place and this summer was transferred to Italian giant Yuventus with an agreement worth 100m euros.
Bregzit: Britain "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "will always regret" if it lost the status of world leader in the production of cars after Braggzit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it's "an alarming" what Toyota-British reported for Bi-Bi-Si, that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We don't need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer reported that the influence of border conditions in the case of Bregzit without agreement would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston - which produces Toyota Auris and Avenues - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that as long as Britain leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a stop to production in our factory," said Marvin Kuk, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about how the EU would operate across borders without agreement, including Honda, Bem-Ve and Jaguar Land Rower.
Be-Em-Ve, for example, says he's gonna close his mini factory in Oxford a month after the Bridge.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics synergy in the case of Bregzit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the "time-to-time" system, where business comes every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a break at the border which, according to the industry, can cause delays and shortcomings in shares.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory in the Derbyshire factory, the company announced, and the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan for future EU relations "is exactly designed to avoid such border checks".
"We need a deal. We need to have the best deal that will enable us not only the success we will enjoy in the present, but also to capture this opportunity," he said about the current Bio-Si Radio 4 programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics synergys."
It could not say how long the production would have been banned, but it long warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvallis, who has been a representative of the union in the factory for 24 years, says that his members are more concerned: “From my experience, as soon as these jobs are taken off, they will never come back.
According to a government spokesman, "we have maintained a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trip's meeting with Rosenstein can again be postponed reports of the White House
Donald Tramp's important meeting with Deputy Public Defender Rod Rosenstein can be "delegated for another week" because he continues the fight about Brett Kavano's nomination for a trial in the Supreme Court, White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Muler, who investigates the Russian mix in the elections, the ties between the supporters of Trump and Russia and the potential violation of the president's laws.
Whether Trump will release the replacement public lawyer and thus threaten Miller's independence, triggering a Washington poll for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was thinking about wearing a camera to record talks with Trip and the possibility of removing the president over the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, with the release of reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of giving up.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was then in the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said "I wouldn't want to leave Rosenstein," but then the meeting was set aside to avoid a dispute at the hearing of the Senate justice committee in which he witnessed and Kavano and one of the women accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a weekly FBI investigation on charges against Cavano, which would further postpone the vote in the Senate.
Tramp Sarah Sanders' printer secretary appeared on Fox News Sunday.
On the question of meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting is not yet determined, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week in view of all that is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things turn out, and I'm always trying to get the press to be properly informed."
Some journalists oppose the claim: Sanders has not kept a briefing for journalists in the White House on September 10th.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the small number of Briffins was not due to the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great impact."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organizes more sessions of questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without giving evidence, "We have examined those numbers."
There will still be Briffins, said Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States questions, that is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you're witnesses that we've been doing it all the time in the last few weeks, and the US presidential talks will replace the briefings for journalists."
Trip regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open sessions or press conferences when visiting high officials.
He recently participated in a self-sustained press conference.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes critical appearance before the gathered journalists.
The Secretary for Health Writing to EU workers working in Scotland's national health system on fear related to Bregzit
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system in which she expresses appreciation for the country and their desire to stay after Bregzit.
Jean Freeman, a envoy to the Scottish Parliament sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the EU's United Kingdom.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of the EU citizens' agreed applications for the status quo they are working in public services at a lower level.
Ms. Freeman wrote in his letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU to withdraw continued during the summer, with a view to bringing the expected decisions to this end.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom also intensified preparations for the possibility of no agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU share widely in precious experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are of benefit to the patients and to the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Cristion Abercrombies submitted to an emergency operation after a head injury
Cristion Abercromby, the lynbecker's default player, Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered the head injury of the competition on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reid, Tennessee State's chief trainer, told reporters that the damage happened just before the half-hour.
"He came to the side line of the game and just jumped on the ground," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave him Abercromby oxygen outside the gym, and then put it in a bag and carried it to further evacuation.
Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Neshville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the nature/level of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombies is a student in the second year and plays his first season in red print at Tennessee State after Ilinois transfer.
He made a total of five meetings on Saturday before he left the game, resulting in a total of 18 meetings this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori’s new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralise the success of Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry expects this move to collect up to 120 million pounds annually, which will be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will now announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be considered an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbin's success in attempting to attract young voters with their promises that it will provide access to home and that it will focus on people with high wage.
The higher administrative fee will be set up by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional means to strengthen the government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional export, which despite the current administrative tax includes the higher levels introduced two years ago for the second house and the purchase of property with a view to renting the same can reach up to three per cent.
The Ministry expects this move to collect up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built property in London has been purchased by a person who did not live in the United Kingdom, leading to price increases and causing difficulties for those who buy property for the first time to engage in this purchase process.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, became “spirit cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers whose most of their time are passing out of the country.
This new policy was published only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of offering high prices to owners who hold the land, but did not use it and asked Ms. May to change the quotas for accessible homes in order to fix "the shameful situation with housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive reforms in the home, including controls on the standard and the end of settlements without a justified reason.
He also wants advice to give them greater authorization to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "In the last year, I said that I would appoint my prime minister to return to the British dream, with life better for every new generation.
And that means adjusting our corrupt domestic market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not fair for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as do foreign companies to be able to buy houses in the same way as British residents.
The dream of owning its own home for many people has become too far, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My final ambition is to manage Scotland."
Jack Ross, the head of "Sunderland" said his "final ambition" is in the future to be the manager of Scotland's national club.
The Scottishman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast Club, which is currently located at the third place in the first league with just three points less than the top club.
This summer he moved to "The Stadium of Light" after returning "St. Mirren" to the Scottish Prime Minister next season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got B cap and that's it," Ross said about the Scottish "Sportsound" of BBC.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland at Hampden with my father and always pulled me back.
However, I could only get this opportunity if I was successful in managing the club."
Some of the presidents of Russia as the manager of the "Sunderland" are Dick Advocatat, David Moyes, Sam Heirdice, Martin O'Nil, Roy Kein, Gas Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no embarrassment knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club since he had previously rejected the offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed by "Can I return this club to the Prime Minister League?"
Given the structure and objects in this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Prime Minister League," he said.
"It's not easy for this club to get there, but I'll probably think I've made a success here only if I bring the club back there."
Ross works as a manager for only three years, where the career went into after he worked as a assistant to the chief at Dumbarton and after a 15-month commitment as part of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped "Alloa" stop falling into the third league and returned St. Mirren from losing his title in the first season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he was playing in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a true cross," he reminds of taking "Alloa".
"I sincerely believed that career as a manager is the real choice for me, a better choice than career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was good at it, I had enough to earn it, and I enjoyed certain high-quality things.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There's a lot of things you need to go through for a week.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure, but I just feel good about the manager’s role.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life."

According to one study, the perfect time for beer is at 17:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat brand has led to an increase in the profits of the British popes who are currently in a very difficult situation, but it has put greater pressure on restaurants' synergys.
The figures show that popes and barons noted an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the profit of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin from CGA for business advisory services in confirming these numbers said: "The sun's time and longer than England's expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June when the father's profit increased by 2.8 per cent and the restaurant significantly decreased.
The decrease in sales of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June has increased further during July.
The popes and barons in which drinkers were mainly sold noted a much greater increase compared with the previous years in contrast with the restaurants where there was noticeable exposure.
The popes in which food was sold mainly were also badly affected by the sun’s periods, although not as dramatic as the owners of restaurants.
It seems that people simply wanted to get drunk.
In successful popes and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales by only three per cent.
Paul Newman, a vacation and hospitality analyst from RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
Time and influence of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent for a year will be particularly noticeable in addition to current pressures that create costs.
The long summer couldn't come in a worse time for the owners of the places where food is sold mainly and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide much needed breath."
The total increase in the sale of papayas and restaurants, including newborns, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the presence of new brands.
The "Coffer Peach Tracker" device to monitor sales in the papal, barbaric and restaurant sector of the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of the 47 operating groups with combined income of over 9 billion pounds and represents a confirmed reper for the industry.
One of five children has a secret profile of social media that hides it from their parents
One study showed that one of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret profile of social media that hides it from their parents and teachers.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
The news increases the fear that sexual content is posted on such profiles
Twenty percent of the disciples said they had a “head ” profile that they showed to their parents
One of five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, is creating a profile of social media that hides it from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has raised the fear that sexual content is published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clear "head" profile that they show to their parents, and there are other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter found the same teenager who asked others "to rape her."
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters'' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is secret.
HMC chief Mike Bukenan said: "It's really frustrating that so many teenagers are trying to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics team
Elid Doyle has been elected as the Executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Committee of the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle, the most outstanding athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Biti described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the lead in this sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience achieved over the past decade.
"All in Scotland, the British and the world's athletic community have great respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if it became a member of the committee," Beti said.
Doyle said: “I am prepared to be the voice of sportsmen, and I hope that I can really contribute and help in the proper direction of sports in Scotland.”
The American who won the 200-400-metre-foot game titles in Atlanta in 1996, despite the total four gold medals won by the Olympic Games, which now appears regularly as a "BBC" comment, was unable to go after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I received a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will show me whether I'm going to be pregnant or whatever.
The whole process was macro-corporated, but I was able to complete it, and I can go back and practice agility!
Thank you for the letters of encouragement!"
An announcement about a construction pump in which mothers are compared with the hard drive that causes division of the mind of the Internet
The construction company for construction pumps causes division of the Internet’s thinking when it publishes a statement in which mothers coming are compared to cows begging.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the most important pump for the world's buildings", a user-oriented technology company "Elvie" announced a funny advertising inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump brings to the mothers that come.
Four mothers dance in a chair for cows full of snow in a song that sounds like, "Yes, I beg milk, but don't look at the mirror" and, "If you didn't notice this isn't called, this is my town."
The referendum continues: "Pup, pump, I feed the babies, pump, pump, I beg my cities."
However, the announcement made to Facebook by the company caused online controversy.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, when many said they were referring to the milk industry's "wheats".
"The real bad decision is to use the goods to advertise this product.
They, just as we should be pregnant and born to be able to produce milk, except for the fact that their children steal from them only a few days after they are born," one of the commentators said.
The "Elvie" construction pump is discrepancies included in the bringeryard ("Elvie"/ "Mother")
Another comment states: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise a bomb for mothers who keep their babies?"
Another added: "A really inappropriate advertising."
Others, however, defended the declaration, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "smooth."
"I think this idea is genius.
I'd buy a pump like this if I still brought it.
I felt like a cow because I was begging.
It's a little crazy, but I think it's true.
It's a word about a genius," one of the commentators said.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertising for mothers who use milk (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like "crowds."
This isn't the announcement that she's missing or that she's judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing while the discreet pumps were stuck in their garden.
The concept behind the campaigns is based on the idea that many women who use milk - pollinating pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely quiet, there are no holes, no pipes and discrepancy is included in the bring-in garden, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out of the house while they suck the milk.
Anna Balarin, a partner and RDR in "Mother" commented: "Elvie's pump is a really revolutionary product and deserves courage and provocative launch.
By setting the barriers between women who suck milk and milk cows we wanted milk with the help of a pump and the challenges that bring them to the center of attention, showing the incredible feeling of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump to be present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jacobski carrying the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly moved to a chess camp at the Texas border
The number of children migrants in prison has increased significantly, although the past of the month limit remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that sharp retirements and policies introduced by the Tramp administration have hindered children's placement at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undetected immigrants and feared the threat of their own stay in the country while seeking to be a sponsor of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to bear fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a high immigration and customs officer last week testified before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for the sponsorship of minors without association.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons have no previous criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of individuals who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country and most of them are foreigners with criminal record.
That's why we continue to abuse those individuals," said Mr. Albens.
In order to facilitate the processing of children, the authorities introduced new rules according to which some of them would be required to appear in court within one month after being arrested, not within 60 days, as the employees in the funeral said they had voted for the previous standard.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to present their case for legal status before the immigration court.
Those who are considered to be uncomfortable getting relief will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in prison, the more likely they will be to become frustrated and depressed, which may lead to violent accidents or attempted escapes, the workers in the shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger objects such as Tornillo, where there is a greater risk of being ignored signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the city without providing enough time for them to prepare emotionally or get along with their friends can increase the traumas most of them are already facing.
Syria told American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulem invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Mualam, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces illegally stood in the territory of Syria under the assumption that they were involved in the fight against terrorism and that "they would act accordingly."
"They must immediately withdraw and that without setting conditions," he said before the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 330,000 people lost their lives in 2011, and millions were isolated from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to lead this world battle until we clear all Syrian territory" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of which train and advise Kurd forces and Syrian Arab forces against President Basar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said that the conditions are good for them to return and accuse "some of the Western countries" of "spreading ironic fears" which encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ease these returns," he said.
"They policy on the question which should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not be provided with reconstruction assistance until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war was reached.
UN diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a tampon-zone in the last large rebellion in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Treaty has prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem pointed out that the contract has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed to the gejadists, including the Nusra Fronts related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out."
UN representative Stefan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, will be held in order to prepare an existing constitution for Syria and open the path to the elections.
Mualam confirmed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "viewing the members of the present constitution," and warned of the consequences of the continued intervention in the same way.
Why Trip's gonna win a second mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Trip will again win the elections in 2020 unless with a tip and a scandal, his presidential mandate will not be interrupted, which is most likely and hoped for by liberarians.
What will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final in the presidency ever seen!"
From now on, there's no sign of delay in the viewers.
Since 2014, the hit time ratings have increased more than twice and reached 1.05 million in CNN and nearly three times increased and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says that "Fox News" has 2.4 million viewers at the time of the attack, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" has reached the top cable rating of about 3.5 million viewers in the evening when important news is being reported.
"This is like a fire to which people feel attracted because this is not something we understand," says Nil Baer, the main television producer of the drama "Designed Survivor" of "ABC" to the cabinet secretary who becomes president after Capitol was destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skwell, a vet in writing comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her she'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He answered, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Scowell told me.
There's also a certain fun value in the whole chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roy case against Wayd, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the welfare of the global economy.
Excluded from all this is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
However, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have seen a panel of experts who have already debated the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a bomb of Paul Manafort's flesh of 15,000 US dollars ("The Washington Post") and the implications of the shocking descriptions of St. Trip's Anatomy by Strommy Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he does and what makes you feel like seeing real show is that every night he's wearing something new," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of "Wellhouse Entertainment" and "Pawn Stars" for the Rotary Team of Trip's show and daily conversions (NFLs, thanks to Kim Yong-won).
You cannot allow yourself to miss any episode because then you will not be able to adapt.
When I visited Mr. Fleis this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watched "MSNBC" while filming CNN.
He could not stop looking, at least not when Brett Kavano was supposed to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was critical.

Access to external resources in the most difficult medium-term elections in the top house race
It is not surprising that the 17th convention area in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganization of the convention areas where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this newly renovated building area in Pittsburgh, the representative of democratic Conor Lamb, who won a place in another area of foreign elections last year.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Kit Rotfus, who is currently representing the old 12th convention area, and who is in a large measure intertwined with the new 17th convention area.
Maps have been changed since the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas are manipulated for the benefit of the republics, which is contrary to the Constitution.
The course in the new 17th Congress area represents a serious competition for funding campaigns between the main sponsors of the parties, the Congress Committee on the Campaigns of the Democratic Party (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Campaigns of the Republican Party (NCRC).
Lamb became the famous name in Pennsylvania after the close victory in the foreign elections for the 18th convention area in Pennsylvania held in March, which was characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Tramp has won an area of 20 points.
Political experts give them little advantage to democracies.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for support for China, and then he gave up.
The diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under a little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Tripp had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama while the partners did not expel the Trump's management team.
The State Department's officials decided to withdraw US diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions to no longer acknowledge Taiwan," Heder Nauert, the State Department's spokesman in his statement at the beginning of this month.
However, only with regard to El Salvador were punished, which received approximately 140 million US dollars in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and total visa restrictions, would have a detrimental effect on the country in Central America and high rates of unemployment and murder in the same way.
As the internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to maintain a similar assembly last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, high administrative representatives indicated that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively put an end to every discussion on El Salvador's punishment.
Deputy President Mike Pens should be elected to the conference scheduled for the mid-October as a sign of the importance of which the administration subscribes to the assembly, diplomats say.
And three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House portal for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thoughts about the state of anonymity.
Their positions were supported by an overhaul analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that can happen is a statement of the report of Special Adviser Robert Miller on possible prosecution of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently a lot of strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also alleged to direct his investigation into the fact that Mr. Tramp's campaigns are linked to Russia in her attack on our elections.
If the composition of the Congress has changed, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility for the body while preparing to appear again before the voters, perhaps even before the proportion of his colleagues.
There are a lot of uncertainty here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, not even his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make certain choices that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to attack Hitler if the West was opposed and supported in Munich.
We failed to do that, and we missed out on the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change, and the relentless march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a number of such changes.
What would we do if Mr. Tramp gave him a leave of the Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot table since this newspaper announced that last year he proposed secretly to shoot the president and speculated that he was innocent of the function he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in "The Times" is incorrect.
"How will we act if the new investigation of Brett Kavano called on by the FBI is unreasonable or unjust, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court and despite the alleged charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote on the midweek election for the Congress, which will condemn Mr. Tramp?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe that's not gonna happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath on a table with a swastika.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans from Rangers with a optimistic attitude in front of the fight with Rapid Vienna
"Rangers" are hosted by the Rapid Vienna match on Thursday, and they are aware of the fact that after the game against "Villareal" in Spain at the beginning of this month's victory over Austria, they will confirm their position to qualify in Group G in Liga Europe.
Graham Dorens, the middle-class player for damage to the knee was prevented from appearing in the season until the unsolved match 2-2 with "Villareal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a drop-off to larger achievements.
"It was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the game believing we could achieve something and we returned with a win point.
Maybe we could give a little more at the end, but the missing result was probably the fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we gave each other everything in the second half, and we were better.
On Thursday, another big European night awaits us.
I hope we'll win three points, but it'll be a hard game because they've had a good outcome in the final match, but I'm sure we'll get back and get a positive result.
The past year was definitely a difficult year in view of everything that happened, my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
Timot is good and guys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, leave the last season behind us and succeed."
Women can't sleep tonight because of this fear associated with pension
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they were talking to their spouse about the costs of a long-term relationship.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but don't take the steps to talk about the same," says Holly Snaider, Vice-President of the Animal Insurance Company "Nationwide".
Here's where you have to start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for the day if you do not share your wishes with them.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to get him because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term, hybrid life insurance policy, which may help you to cover your expenses or provide self-sustainment with your own resources, if you have them.
Share your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the same time.
Take full care of your health care so that you can be confident that your health care will be monitored and that health professionals will respect your wishes unless you are able to communicate.
Also, think for a moment about your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose people from trust to carry the financial decisions in your name and pay your bills unless you are able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the drugs you drink and his allergies?
Note these details in a written form to be prepared.

A man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times by an air gun as he returned home from leaving.
A 40 - year - old victim was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracomb when he was shot in the cities, the stomach, and the hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 BST (British summer time) as "a random act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police appeal to the Witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, a total of officials were expected to increase the number of victims.
As a result of the interruption of the communications, aid personnel cannot obtain information from the Dongala area, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter at 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
In addition to several key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Solavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of the En River on the west coast of the island of Solavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40-year-old when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Dongala represents a region that extends more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) across the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Solavesi.
The area, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's economy, Central Sulawesi, particularly in the coastal region of Dongala.
The flood of snow is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
The Indonesian disaster relief agency says that Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
The tsunami also struck and hit Dongala in 1996, when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific ring of fire and regularly strikes earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: The great earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acheh in northern Sumatra caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them were inhabitants of Acheh.
2005: Low earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra by the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most inhabited island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that destroyed the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: 7.6 degree earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - degree earthquake struck one of the Isle of Mentavaj, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached ten feet [10 m] and destroyed tens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake with a flat focus hit the Pidi Jaya district in Ache, causing empty and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed in the fallen city.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested on charges of family violence
Trek Palin, the oldest son of Aliyasca's former governor and candidate for President Sarah Palin was arrested for the charge of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested suspected of family violence, interfering in a family violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a woman’s acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, she took the phone.
Palin is located in Mat-Su Prison Station with the possibility of leaving until he pays a sum of 500 US dollars, KTUU said.
On Saturday he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when he was asked how he was explained to the court, he said from the network.
Palin is faced with three violations of Class A, which means that he can be sentenced to a prison sentence for a year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a B-class breach, sentenced to one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time to commit a criminal charge against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before Alyaska's veteran court is pending.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interfering in the report on domestic violence and possession of arms under alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he had apparently hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the Veteran groups in 2016 after she said that her son's violent behavior is a result of PTSN, the result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Solavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric energy and communications networks are halted, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulawesi, which is located north of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social media circulate the video on which the moment of the attack has been shown.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek a recent death penalty for suspects of the terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death sentence for Saifolo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York where eight people died, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the federal crime state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 October, reportedly used a rental truck at Home Depot to launch an attack on the West Side road in the Lower Manhattan and to cross the passageways and bicycles that were found on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed eight victims "simply" and "sounded" committed serious physical injuries, according to the report on the intention of seeking a death sentence delivered in the South region of New York.
According to judicial documents, there is a possibility of a death penalty and on both these grounds of the criminal act.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court filed a 22-founded charge against Saipov, including eight charges of murder for the purposes of rectification, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
In order to carry out the attack, there was a need for "detail planning and thinking," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov had done it as a "grossy, rough and unscathed."
"Saifulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused, injured, damaged and lost families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Dekat, Daren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the state's report said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a death penalty was executed in the South District of New York.
The defendant, Calid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to a life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 was for July and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being sentenced to a prison sentence for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both were sentenced to a death sentence with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show up in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
The police reported that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police also reported that he asked to put the sign of ISIS in his hospital room.
He explained that he was innocent on all 22 grounds of the charge.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were clearly disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence, rather than accept recognition of the guilt and to express a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved in the same event," Paton said.
Saipov's defense previously asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
A member of the "Tori" party says NAJEL FARAJ should be responsible for the Bregzit negotiations
Nigel Faraj today during the protest of the "Tori" party conference promises to "mobilize the people's army".
Former leader of the "Ukip" party said politicians must "feel the heat" from the Eurosceptics, while one of Teresa May's supporters proposed that he be liable for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn of the bridge in Birmingham said the United Kingdom is still "will be outside the EU" if Mr. Faraj was a Secretary for the Bridge.
However, the challenge faced by Ms. May in view of the merger of her deeply-shared members was highlighted by the counter-Brigset members of the "Tori" party, who joined in a special protest against Brigit that was held in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to continue implementing the Czechs plan despite the attacks by the Pro-Brigsets, the anti-Brigsets and the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue with efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would encourage Eurosceptics and the members of the Laburist Party to choose between its package and Haos.
Mr. Bonn told the Pro-Bregzit, "Leave Means Leave" assembly in Solikhal that he wanted to "refused the Czech plan".
He suggested that Mr. Faraž should be involved and that he should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for the negotiations, we would still be outside the EU," he said.
The pursuer from Velingborough added: "I will support Braggzit, but we must reject the Czech plan."
Showing his attitude toward the EU, he said: “We have not fought in the world war for now to be defeated.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the suggestion that the public opinion had changed from the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people changed their mind and wanted to stay in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, member of the "Tori" and Pro-Brigset Party, also attended the march and said about journalists: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Czechs plan is not well-accepted by the public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well-accepted by our party and our activists, who are actually the ones that go out on the streets and who owe our victory to the elections.
Please give up the Czechs' plan and start listening to us."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj at the meeting said politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to deliver the decision that was brought to the referendum in 2016.
"This is now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to deliver the Bridge, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get out of it."
In a message to the spirit - inspired crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to hand it over to Brigitte, to feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country which enables us to win in Braghitis and which will not stop until we become independent, self-righteous and proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the counter-Brigzite people marched through Birmingham, before holding a two-hour meeting in the city center.
At the meeting of the group, a small number of activists appeared this weekend carrying banners with the inscription "Tourivists against Braggs".
Lord Adonis, member of the Laburist Party, mocked the conservatives on the security issues facing the opening of the conference on the application that created the party.
"These are people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all needed technology for Canada plus, for a border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete fascist.
There's nothing called good Braggs," he added.
Varen plans to think carefully about the president's application
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says "he's going to think very well about the president's nomination" after the elections in November.
Boston Globe said the representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about his future during the city assembly in West Massachusetts this week.
Voren, a hailed critic of President Donald Trump, will be running the re-elections in November against the representative of the Republican Party's Jeff Dil, who was co-chaired by the Tromp campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Sunday afternoon in Holicok was her 36th meeting with the voters after Trip came to the presidential function, with the holding using the form of a city council.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to apply for a president.
Voren replied that it is time for "the women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and that includes setting up a woman on top."
The suspect was arrested for the shooting and death of Corporal Sims by the LSU team
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that the suspect for the shooting and death of Corporal Ved Sims by the LSU team that happened on Friday was arrested.
The baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Diton Simpson, 20, at the press conference at 11 o'clock in the east.
They announced a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man from the picture.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Weide Sims had an explosive wound in his head and as a result of the same death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said about the media on Saturday, "247sports".
Weide was involved in protecting his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene of crime, possession of weapons, as well as shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to prison in the East Baton Rouge police station in Paris.
As a junior high 192 centimetres that grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 matches last season, about 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 hits by game.
Gran At Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders ensured victory over Sebastian Vetel
From the time Walter Botas qualified on Saturday, it became clear to Luis Hamilton that Mercedes's team orders will play a major role in the race.
From half position, Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the seat while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his opponent.
Well, Vetel first went into the box and let Hamilton fight the move at the end of the group, something he should have had a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went forward after the action one of one who made Ferrari's driver difficult to leave the inside of his free risk to remain on the side of the second move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstapen started from the back line of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended at seven.
Then he led the majority of the race and directed the tires of his car to get to the finish line and reach Kimy Raiconen, taking the fourth place.
He finally entered the 44th round box, but he couldn't raise the temperature in the other eight rounds, so Raikonen came to the fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walter's done a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has made a truly exclusive decision to have its couple in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad speech of the body.
President Donald Tramp mocked Senator Diana Faynstein's interview on Saturday about her claim that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blassi Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavano of sexual assault.
In his speech at the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not direct attention to Ford's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people are "bad and inexhaustible and inexhaustible."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's happening in the Senate in the last few days you can see anger, people who are angry and angry and indifferent and unsound," he said.
"When you see ads and information protections and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Faynstein, did you publish this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute then.
No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter of information was sent to Fainstein about the charges against Cavano by Ford still in July, and they were published in early September, but Fainstein denied that the protection of information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't publish her story," Fainstein told the committee, "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep them in confidence, and I did what she asked."
But it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented on the same meeting on Saturday: “I will tell you something, it was really a bad talk about the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst talk I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that democratics use instructions to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to return power in any way.
You can see their evil, subtly, they don't care who's gonna hurt, who's supposed to be able to return their power and control," said the president, as Mediaite said.

France Busher is equal to Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen to ensure their victory with his two heads.
This was the third break in the season within the Elite League for Adam Kifi's boys, who returned with the victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, when Giants won the previous three contests.

Flight controller dead by helping hundreds of people on the plane to escape the earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after his death by helping hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many have disappeared since the great earthquake struck the island of Solavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong successive movements continue to leave the area, and many are buried in the Urnati in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues refused to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave the position at the control tower of Mutirara Sis Al Jufri in Palu, which was constantly falling.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air aircraft with flight number 6321 which was then on the track would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News said.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Paul.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands of people, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Siggi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the urnets, while many cannot even access them," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The ships that reached up to six feet [6 m] abandoned Paul, where a mass grave would be held on Sunday.
Wars and commercial airplanes carry help and relief.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother said about Sky News: "A quick hand carries the body every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The minimarcts are everywhere stolen."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said about CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can become even worse."
Indonesia’s president, Yoko Vidodo, arrived in Palu for a week and ordered the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a man disappeared after the plane crash in the valley
The airline operating with the plane that fell into the Pacific Laguna in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, since he previously said 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the plane that tunneled.
Air Niugini said they can't find the male passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline reported working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land on Chuck Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in a stable state.
The reason for the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane had hit the legend near the track.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had missed the track.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"That's an extremely good job," said Janes.
Janes said he and the others were able to pass through the water that reached half of them and to head to the emergency exits of the plane that tunneled.
He said that the Stoards were panicked and screamed, as well as that he suffered a little pain on his head.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the reconstruction of the port also contributed to the rescue of the ship by pushing people on the shore before the plane to land about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data show 111 people died in accidents at PNG registered in the last two decades, but none of them were included in Air Niugini.
An analyst confirms a time frame of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man who charged that a woman in Mississippi burned her alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst from the U.S. Ministry of Justice, testified for hours as an expert expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He pointed out that he used phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlet said he got data on the location of several mobile phones that show that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, said The Clarion Ledger.
When based on the data it was shown that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that the day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "false because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Telephone records show that they knew only one week.
Rowlet said that some time after Chambers died, Telis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hail.
The defence should present its final arguments in the week.
The judge said he was expecting the jury to decide the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What's a connected hip-hop?
Hip-hop Trio wants to kill the negative attitude of this gentleman with the inclusion of positive messages in his music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip-hop has distanced from its origin as a music with political messages that has a purpose in solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their life through artists such as "Acala" and "Lowkey".

A New York woman accused a couple of being released after sending a "racist" message
A woman from New York accused a couple of being released on the basis of discrimination after her error received a message from the mother who complained that she was "another black woman."
The marriage couple deny that they are growing up, saying that the prosecution is actually "a shock."
Linci Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016, after the first working day of new negotiator Jisel Morris found out that she was black.
"I don't care about a single Cricket," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message directed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, and that's twice.
Once she understood what she actually did to Plasco-Flaxman, feeling "unsuitable" she left Mrs. Morris, saying that their friend-in-law, an African-American, had done the job badly and that she was expecting her daughter to be from the Philippines, says New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for the first working day and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris accuses the couple and seeks compensation for the damage to the export release of $350 a day for six months, a commitment that would involve her to live with the family, which was initially committed, but without conclusion of the agreement.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do such things," she said on "Post" on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the allegations that they were racist, saying that Ms. Morris' resignation was a reasonable step because they feared they could no longer believe her after they had hurt her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't think of.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco for "Post".
“But would you trust your children on the face of what you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
By saying that the prosecution was "sustaining", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in "a very difficult situation."
“Are you going to attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public is quick to condemn the couple’s social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Podington's publishers fear readers will not be able to connect with a sword that speaks, found in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book’s adoption, said: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very interesting that we now know all about the great success of Padington.
After she said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before being inspired to write the book of a small game in the form of a sword, would be optimistic even if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60-year release of the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she adds that her father felt quiet pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to thank you at all," she said.
"But, because he felt Paddington so real, it was almost like having a child that achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success does not depend on you.
I think Paddington's success took him this way.
Although it was a word of creation and the fruit of his fantasy, he always wrote his own Paddington.
My daughter was in a dead bed, and I had to meet her on the phone.
Her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
"Then I was summoned regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that it will not survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperus said.
"Then Nad called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did to her.
And I said, “Dad, I really love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that her doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate gradually decreased, and they left her system.
She died early, and this meant that all her systems were canceling.
I just had to sit and wait, aware that all of this was happening.
I couldn't get up, or cry, or cry again because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay awake."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, complaining about the loss of his daughter, fell on the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I raised my head, and the tears didn't stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much she loved her."
Injured women set up bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide do their best to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphris put cards at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers on which people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and he killed himself at an age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had a great potential to become a cook, as well as an infected smile.
"All remembered him for his smile.
People always said that his smile could light every room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
His brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm always afraid it will have a consistent effect."
Ms. Davis develops the cards "for others to let them know that there are people out there who can talk to and who can talk to, even if it becomes a word for a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Hamphris, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark, who was married for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, so he didn't say anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas day when the children opened their gifts, and he didn't even look at them in the eyes and set up no contact with them."
She said that his death is a tremendous tragedy for all of them, but they must find a way to pass on it: “This is the way the family is going to be destroyed.
We're broken.
But we must continue to fight."

Bret Kavano's future is uncertain after the FBI started the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something that looks like what he was looking for, a limited time survey, with limited scope, we might be able to achieve a little unity," Mr. Fleyk said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "disrupt" under the current non-partisan state.
Why did Kavano and his supporters of the Republican Party not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their mobility is due only to the timing.
The medium-term elections should be held for just a few weeks, or on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to fail, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the highest court in the country.
George V. Bush calls the senators, where they are fighting to support Mr. Kavano who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who, again, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI announces its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are now 51 republics and 49 democracies.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano could receive at least 50 votes in the Senate's vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the result and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "has decreased" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea decreased since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, South Korea's envoy said.
Park Bjøong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Federation Ministry of Union, says there have been 1.127 crossings over the border compared to 2011 when there were 2.706 in the past year.
Mr. Park said the strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and the high rates of people's blacks are key factors.
Penguin didn't comment publicly.
Most North Korean refugees are currently receiving citizenship in South Korea.
Saul says that more than 30,000 people from North Korea illegally crossed the border from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border is located with North Korea and which can easily be moved in line with the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees and often repatriate them by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still in the war, has improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Beijing to discuss topics that focused on the stand of negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Tramp and Kim Yong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea's Foreign Minister Riy Young-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States on the rise from then to now.
"As long as there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot put ourselves in a single state," Mr. Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavano "historic" and says he's not qualified to serve at the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority at the representative's house called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavano "histerical" and said that if he takes into account his temper he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't but think that if a woman acted that way, she would say it's "historical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the Kawano testimony to the Senate justice committee on Thursday.
Chavano emotionally denied claims that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blassy Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavano was very emotional at his opening remarks, sometimes even crying and missing while talking about his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned the democracies in the committee, calling them "the gross and coordinated destruction of his view" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes that Cavano’s testimony is proof that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has shown himself to be a threat to democracy.
"I think she is disqualifying herself with those statements and the way she attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question whether she would try to remove Cavano from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the Representative's house.
"I'll say it next: if he doesn't tell the truth before the Congress or the FBI, then he's not only qualified to serve in the Supreme Court, but he's not even qualified to serve in the court where he's at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently a judge at the District Appeal Court in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she was concerned about the possible judgments that would bring Kavano against the Act on Access to Health or Roy against Wade, because he is considered a subject of conservative justice.
In the hearings to confirm his application, Kavano did not answer the questions about whether he would lower some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a decent, fearful man to enter the court and expect us to say, "It's really beautiful," Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's really a severe criticism, months, and years of anger gathering, which she can't release without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was doing an executive function somewhere, and who told me that she cried when she was angry, but she managed to develop her own technique, so when she became angry and started to cry, she tells her face, ‘ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continues to cry.
I think that's genius."
The salts are allowed as an explosive ventilator for anger partly because they are, in fact, wrongly interpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first workplaces at the office where the men dominated me was when I once started crying with unexplained anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager of which I always had some fear, took me to the door and pulled me off the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've been able to reach you."
Patricia Shreder was a democratic convention in Colorado during that time and worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a ship's sexual affair called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Shreder, deeply frustrated, he realized that there was no reason why she would not think of the idea of running for the president.
"That wasn't a well thought-out decision," he said 30 years later through a laugh.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Sneaked and seven jujien."
In view of the fact that the campaign was long started, she did not have enough financial resources, so she promised she wouldn't get into the race unless she collected 2 million US dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters gave her men $1,000, and she would give her only $250.
"Do they think I need a break?" she asked.
During the talk she announced that she would not start formal campaigns she was so overwhelmed by emotions, about thanks to the people who supported her, the frustration of the system for which it was so hard to collect funds and to terage voters rather than delegates and hate for sexism, she began to cry.
"If you'd seen me you'd probably think I'd have a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Shreder about how the media responded to the case.
"You'd think "Clinex" was a corporate sponsor.
I remember asking them to write on my grave plate.
"She's crying?"
How trade war between the United States and China can be a good job for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the beginning of the U.S. and China's trade war was exciting and although the battle is far from over, the conflict between countries can be useful for Beijing on a long-term basis, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by withdrawing key exports to China, including solar panels, chel and aluminium.
The situation has significantly deteriorated during this week by introducing new rates of goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion dollars), which effectively accounted for half of the goods coming into the United States of China.
Pecking each time returned to nature, relatively recent inflation rates from five to ten per cent of US dollars' worth of $60 billion.
China promises to return to the United States with the same measure, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will decline at the same time.
To make Washington withdraw means to accept his demands, but public devotion to the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, US military pressure can result in positive support for China on a long-term basis because it will reduce the interdependentness of both economies.
"The fact that with a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing, conditions can be created to start an economic collapse in any of the countries is much more dangerous than was previously identified by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focused on Asia at the New American Security Centre, which represents a tank tank.
Syria "prepared" for the return of refugees," said the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help restore the country that remained free of the long war that lasted for more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mullam said conditions in the country improved.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, which is due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew areas abandoned by terrorists in order to restore the state to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that affected their daily life and lives are now ensured.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulam said the Syrian regime welcomed aid in the renewal of the country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept any help or help from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe has won a significant victory on the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the US team in Ryder's 2018 Cup with a final score of 16.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in the European field and has not won the title of Ryder’s purchase in Europe since 1993.
Europe restored its image after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points that were needed for victory over the United States.
American star Phil Mikelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, at his first hit of the hole, drove the ball into the water in par-3 of the 16th hole, losing it from the French Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari was highlighted throughout the round, with one of the four players who achieved the score 5-0-0 after the tournament began to be organized in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spyt lost the score of 5:4 from the top ranked player of the European team, Torbion Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the top ranked player in the world lost 2 and 1 by Ian Poulter from England, who may have played the Ryder Cup the last time.
Spanish veteran Serhio Garsiya, a participant of eight Ryder purchases, became the European who won most of the tournament’s titles with win 25.5 points during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so glad we're back on the title.
The team game is most important, and I am happy that I could help," said the emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He's now leaving his coroner John Ram's place, which one of the ones won on Sunday, Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with score 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud that I won Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder purchase.
It's a talk about amazing statistics on one of the best players at all times, who won 14 big titles, when he ran after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team for the weekend was trying to direct the game to low-forested areas, except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-quality golf throughout the entire tournament.
American team captain Jim Furic after his team's disappointment game said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
One morning, we assigned him the difficulties of the European team.
We fought.
I fell down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American Association of Professional Golfers and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit them.
We were in a state of shock.
