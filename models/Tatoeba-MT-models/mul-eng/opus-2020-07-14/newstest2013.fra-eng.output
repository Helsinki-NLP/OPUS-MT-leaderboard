A Republican strategy to combat the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth, stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by fire.
In addition, Republican lawyers have only recognized 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will be partly the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, American States are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this sense that a majority of American governments have promulgated new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has expanded since the November 2010 elections, which are expected to add 675 new Republican representatives to 26 States.
Consequently, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced during the year 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with photos and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce voting periods by precipitation, invalidate the right to vote as a elector on the day of the election and withdraw citizens with a judicial record of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present an identity card with a photo.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities are committed to extending this practice to other States.
In the past two years, they have produced draft laws in 34 States to force voters to present an identity card with a photo.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the disease insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, or 21 million people, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it is often more than $100 to obtain the required identity card.
New restrictions affect young people, minorities, and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of Africans, 15% of those who earn less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of 18-29-year-old voters do not have the required identity card with photos.
All right.
Students, elected voters considered to be more voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with photos issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of the fishing or hunting clubs to vote further on the Republican side to vote for the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required evidence of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws calling for voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
But it is obvious that two Spanish electors on three are favouring the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators broke laws requiring electoral registration on the day of the polling in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to subscribe.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electoral registration campaigns have helped to record about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures taken since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17 per cent in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the voting period by precipitation.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the last were only 13 per cent of the state electors.
He went with the Spanish.
These represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the whites who formed 76% of the electors represented only 46% of the electors voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters were strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting electoral registration.
Several draft laws have been blocked by the vetos of democratic rulers.
The general lawyer of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They have been able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws calling for the presentation of an identity card with a photo.
However, the new rules in place will inevitably make the exercise of voting rights more difficult in 2012.
Democrat criticisms indicate the partial nature of the laws that have been voted and have clearly been aimed at influencing results in 2012 in key States.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required for the election to win the presidency.
It is too early to say that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will be partly the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer diagnosis: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present incorrect results, with false or even negative results, resulting in unnecessary medical intervention.
What will make men more reluctant to pass exam tests?
Whether to pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of pollution among the witness groups, so it was difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another European study concluded that there was a difference between mortality among patients who had a diagnosis and those who did not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up of 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more chance of having metastases if not specified.
So I recommend the test from 50 years of age, or 40 years of age, if there is a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer.
The men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indulgent.
It is true that the patient needs to understand the risk of his cancer by offering the possible options, by not necessarily treating the cancers of the prostate that do not lead to long-term life, and by opting instead, in these cases, for an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many people who detect cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to be actively monitored and if the disease progresses, they will be provided with treatment.
In addition, the criteria for determining who should or should not be dealt with are precisely determined.
So I recommend that you pass the test.
But it is important to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool to assess the use and resistance of the APS test.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recovery to prevent cancer.
Despite research progress, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and drank enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one had smoked any more, this rate would climb to at least 50%," notes André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, approximately 10% of cancers are estimated to be caused by heredity.
Many remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a big night for people's health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments André Beaulieu's spokesman.
Comforting data: 10 years after smoking, the risk of death from a drop in half.
The weights
Embonpoint and obesity also promote the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increased the risk of breast cancer, colon and right, oesophageal, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against the cancer of the colon," he adds.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, she's grimmering the risks of getting into a colorectal cancer.
Chargers too, and they should be avoided.
Preservation of the meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter may damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," he explains.
The vitamins
In recent years several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not final for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established no longer.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and his family background with his doctor.
"To pass a diagnosis test, it doesn't give the cancer."
The Higgs Box Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boss created a whole soul, the last state, and for cause.
We believe that this botanist participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but that.
And then it's about the last particular of which is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "the worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it's not quite sure it's the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we have a real new particularity, and that it is very similar to the Higgs box provided by the Standard Model.
Moreover, new data released this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still no data to be perfectly certain.
Let's assume that he's doing well with Higgs, because the chances of getting tired seem less, and see what he's doing.
There is, in this lower world, a fairly unconventional law that wants two things not to be found in the same place at the same time.
I can't ignore this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
But even if the physical of the particles is a very strange world, it seems that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantity state" - this "state" is a major way in some of their characteristics.
From there the physicists class the particles in two categories.
In a corner, there are good farmers, who wisely obey Paul’s principle.
And in the other case, the bosses, a bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means they can be beautiful and well found in the same place at the same time.
These bosses are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely, otherwise) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the months, which we will not address here, and the "force parts", by which the great forces of nature spread and which the Higgs box would appear in some way.
These boons, it needs to be highlighted here, are not all so exotic bets that we can believe.
In fact, if you are able to read this chronic, it is thanks to a box of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light part" that is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particular with an accelerated electric charge or a change of direction, it "depends" the electromagnetic field in this particular location, a little like a cahilling in a stang.
From this "degradation" there is an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus, one of the "force-porters" boxes.
Champ plus stable
It goes in the same way as the Higgs Boone, to this difference as it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "deranged" so that the Bouncy Boon will appear.
But, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to avoid it, it needs to reach very, very high energy, just as if it were a yellow wall, with only a very large rock that could lift the surface.
That is why a huge acceleration of particles like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is an average of 27 km from the conference! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the ratio between the Higgs and the mass.
This is not actually all the particles or all the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never have it on a frigo.
And in the same way, this is not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that make it have a mass, while the others (such as the photo, tapes) do not.
Now, what is it that "may bring" all these researches, asking Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine the difference between MS observations and predictions.
They are also several who wish to be found, because the smallest difference could open a door on a "physical novel" and blow some pieces of the Model.
It must be said that there are still huge gaps, offering no explanation for gravity (ups!) or the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe's matter (re-ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of these research on the day of monsieur and Mrs. Tout-le-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would have been wrong to assume that they will not exist.
Keep in mind: early in the 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories never doubted the revolution that their work was about to begin.
They were involved in scientific applications, but nothing remained.
In fact, we have already said the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself put it at the point of the first continuous laser (the first were pushed) in 1962 - at the start of the laser was rather seen as a "labor gadget".
Can not open message
And then applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle made a small light capter in 1969, during his optical work.
This captain, although not of his original intention, now serves as "oil" to all the world's digital photo devices, and has valued the 2009 Nobel.
This certainly does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but this means that we really don't know...
Palliative Cares - The Best Way to Die...
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must take place gradually when a draft law is prepared.
But in this important area, much remains to be done.
The Debor tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that was round him had left him for two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said, mi-figue mi-raisin, extended in his bed to the Victoria-Gadbois palliative care house in Beloeil, where the guard arrived.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease does its work: a serious weakness that prevents it from becoming alone with the toilets, and even eating alone.
met before a guest in the morning, he agreed to let himself be helped to eat, redesigned.
Courage, he even smiles, talks to strangers around him, brings his medications to him, offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish, is that I'm cured of diarrhoea, that's humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In our lives, we learn that a man, it's raining out," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's house.
Returning to the stage of the child is unacceptable for some people.
" This depends on the person ' s ability to accept the regression, note it.
Because, in the opinion of a number of people working in palliative care, great moments come from the heart even of this regression.
The patients who go to Victor-Gadbois hospital are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the " team of doctors and nurses who do not give them more attention than " curatives".
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die " conscious and excited " .
But the disease has made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," add it.
"I no longer have desires in life," she said, before accepting that we put a mask on him to help him breathe.
She still looks forward to a last visit of her son from Italy in the coming days.
At Victor-Gadbois, we are produced, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
These are palliative care, which we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a hospital for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very small when we know we're all done dying one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether it is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you will agree to produce oral care at the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer have to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of daily life.
Last night, we used a beer at Mr. X, lost during the night.
This morning, it's his son who's gonna end the beer at the feet of the deceased.
" We help our neighbors as much as the patients," says Natalie Savard, director of care.
At Victor-Gadbois's house, the days follow, but they don't look like them.
On the side of an 93-year-old man who spent his last family assembly in the court, well hidden in his ears while he was drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old young man was tragically killed, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after trying to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five litres occupied by cancers under 45 years of age, " concerned Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois are from their home, 47% are from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not simply have access to palliative care, i.e. to care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the final phase of his life, whether at home, hospital or at home.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Montreal-based palliative care company, specialize more or less exclusively in the cancer care offered.
This is precisely this great lack in Quebec's health care, which makes it a fear of a number of paralytic doctors who are afraid of the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto, signed by emissaries of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, is about to witness their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to palliative quality care before it is agreed to proceed to euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I think patients don't want to die because they don't get adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists rely on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's prospects for survival were already minimal when she left an experimental chemotherapy.
When I announced to my uncle that I would stop the treatment, she answered that she regretted that I would stop fighting, she told me.
But she told me I was done!
Non-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who ask to die are grateful that they did not have access to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, management of palliative care to the Palliative Care Society at the home of the Grand Montreal, patients would be refractory to treatment of pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors have often resorted to palliative sedation, which returns to sleep until the time of death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer act as if we do not understand this part of the suffering.
Furthermore, the unresolved disease will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to get rid of me," that means "I want to be relieved."
The implementation of this report has been made possible through a Canadian Health Research Institute Journalism.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and specialists of the Italian Mafia are happy to know the day after day what they know of a formal "system", namely the construction industry, staff, politicians, unionists and mafioso.
A " industry " that has paid very high attention to Quebecan taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's as curious as the system has been trying since we took the major means," ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a former police officer in Quebec and Montreal.
It is by him that the scandal was published in 2011, by means of a thorough investigation of the abuses related to road work contracts in Quebec, where the first liberal minister of the day, Jean Charrest, had allowed only the rounds.
The Duchessneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden financing of parties and corruption of officials.
"Since the start of the survey in 2010, it has been pointed out that the only transport department would have spent a billion dollars on contracts," some reflecting their instincts to touch a share!
The Carbon Commission "has already lost two masters", he adds, hoping that it will "show the strategists behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also attached to its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More police than the "Marteau Scouade" who, since 2009, would have led Montreal's "jootots cartel" to put the sweet pedal on the contract flows...
In recent weeks, she has conducted a series of investigations and has brought charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elections, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town of Banlowe.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who is about to be released from his Mare post of Laval, the third city in Quebec.
It is suspected that there may be repeated delays in the exchange of public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers on the streets of Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the Commission the "system" mechanism for obtaining public contracts.
He himself spent 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal in the middle of the Mafia that converted the money to Union Montreal, the part of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito spent more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about €68 000) on provincial parties, especially on liberals then in power.
He also had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former liberal Prime Minister, Nathalia Normandeau.
Cost-of-expenditure contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system was operating around.
Gilles Surprent, ex-inhibitor in public works, has been well-detailed before the Commission: in ten years, he has received offers of construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and can be totaling $736 000 in exchange for expensive rental contracts.
Other road officials have been accused of grading the floor by 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the billings, by extra counterfeiting.
Then an organizer of the Maori party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his pockets with salt money.
Following these revelations, Mr Tremblay released early November, exploding Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Roulau was one of Montréal's first elections to draw the alarm bell.
Mary of Rivière-des-Praiies's arrondissement, east of the island, has risen from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land of $5 million and resale... 1.6 million to promoters, full of real estate.
70% silver sala in electoral campaigns
Of the investigation that will be finalized, she said that "takes on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, filtered by forums, to stop the gangrene and push the fatalities."
The process, she says, is "a painful but positive one."
We are about to clean the beach, but there would be a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a guard, so that we don't see any suspicious practices coming back.
Like we did the house.
I'll be right there.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is concerned mainly about the role of "elus at the end of the street", when they didn't get into the magooil!
Estimateing 70% of the share of money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that this was nothing but a reflection of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit the contributions to the parties to $100, but this will not change the woman, according to him: "As long as electoral expenditure is not limited, there will be political money."
He requested a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of the parties: "We cannot go down any further; to go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow the house to be restored on more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story holds the international picture of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who wish to look at it in their own court...
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you took a new cover with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by an individual awareness taking but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also contributed a lot to me.
Every day, these elements make me have my level of play.
And, in the match, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the foot.
But I don't get caught.
From my start at the Clairefontain INF Preformation Centre on my way to Saint-Etienne, I've always made progress through palies.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
Recruitments of this event are usually used to discuss very high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He's exaggerated by supporters like Claude Makelele, who played at the same post as me.
Ancelotti is the man of the situation?
Sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, it is not equal to League 1 and is one of the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with retired clubs.
It cost him a lot of big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a pleasant discussion with him.
I came out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my achievements.
How do you view the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1, Lyon took us the lead.
But we're still in trouble.
One of our major objectives is the League of Champions: we are qualified for the 8th final in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We tried to go as far as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say against very good European teams.
First, we want to finish our chicken first in front of Porto so we can get back at the 8th of the final.
Can the PSG become a large European short term club?
He's already got the budget...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and be included in the duration.
Today, that's not the case.
Finally, the PSG provides the means for this project to be completed.
In League 1, wouldn't winning the title, like last season, be a big mistake?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we're really going to have to stop this champion's title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because there were quality to end first.
We made a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even though large teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to carry.
Do you think the media wait too much of the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We accept it completely.
Then, when we get 4-0 at home against Troyes and there's still things to do with us, it's sure it's a little frustrating.
We're asking what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to put in place a game project.
A team is built with time.
We have proven in Ligue champions that we could answer these questions.
See Manchester City that has not, since two months, qualified for the 8th finals, they have also made huge expenditures!
In view of the investments, you were imagined with 15 points ahead to the tree!
It was a failure of our enemies and France's champion.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season, were "boots" by this new PSG.
This shows that Law 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we can have the smile in telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have done so.
The PSG seems completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
That's better than saying there's a Zlatan dependency.
This means that Abrahamovic is very successful and that he has many goals.
He came for this and proved to be the star of League 1.
He proved everywhere he went, that he was a great player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This moves others to get their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows the whole world to make progress.
How did you win the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I had the courage to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing time.
I saw things over there, and I got strengthened.
Today, I'm going to make a good selection match.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we must have exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World.
The picker is strict, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will drive the Blues to Brazil.
The good zero (1-1) arrived on 16 October in Spain is a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for the world.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a similar match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All the contrary of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and treatment costs between the parties involved.
In addition, as often as in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent exchange protocol, which allows exchange of peer files.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept cookies as gifts or as means of payment.
The Bitcoin course, after reaching a $30 (€23) sum in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before returning around $110 today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual coin", "competitive to the dollar or the euro" and "like to conventional coins".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that we get by playing or that we can buy it (and sometimes exchange it back).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
However, each time a central authority controls and deals with trades.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositors of the book of accounts, verifiers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to make sure that the lost Bitcoins exist well in the book of public accounts, distributed on the whole network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner, like a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file extension phase, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital printer.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "hacher" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special impression (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes will easily verify that it's the right one.
The transaction is therefore indestructiblely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, for fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very fast (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining Orphein because the two have different interests.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
So the number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to up to 100 million, which leaves the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also related to each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already been high and low.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and Bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The failure used does not concern itself," says Pierre Noizat, who is about to launch Paymium, a real money-laundering company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also made money-laundering opportunities through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Weight actors such as Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins do not travel.
In November, "generous soldiers" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been lost," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who becomes gold Bitcoins.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogical book on this coin, believed in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which return less expensive.
The porter manages its identity more and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in the marketers, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can "photographer and acknowledge", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures thousands of users.
There is a general movement of withdrawal due to hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to get involved, but 2013 could be a tournament," he said.
The ECB, in its report, also intends to reassess the various risks that are now considered to be high, if this money is successful.
We're part of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapas and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
These are particularly the Afghan countries that we have punished in regard to them as terrorists.
And we, with our 88 dead soldiers, and the wounded, mutilated.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former refugees in Pakistan, but often countries that reject foreign military presence, such as the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by Jewish, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
Tolerance, sometimes supported by local resurrected ones, will no longer be the case when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the high hills planted with French credits, took place in the order.
The trucks and blinds joined Kaboul without being attacked, overrun by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban departure on Kaboul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistibly progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kaboul was then empty, the country of fire and blood from the struggle between different factions.
Their country's control had then been seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscenity of these countries beyond the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved in our day.
Former Muudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban are joining in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notable elements of the anti-Soviet war came into power in 2001.
They have moved to affidavits, getting out of government land to sell them on land to build refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American sub-contracts of sub-contracting.
They were disappointed; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, hope for a government that is not made up of voters.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who benefit from America’s wide range: the loss of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They spent the modern world on their islands in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population under 25 years of age; Kaboul now accounts for 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls like boys.
Work will need to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscenity of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are portable telephones; television, and its Turkish pages, which present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet war are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will escape from central power.
Afghanistan, mountain country, to the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised, powerful, presidential state, eliminating the post of Prime Minister existing since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been, since the 50s and so forth, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been reintroduced, no barriers are in place, no important irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by war for thirty years, government control on infrastructures would have been necessary.
The noise was pointed out that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This has only added to the feeling that the West were just about to impact them.
Without energy to treat the coal or copper mine on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, allowing international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) to browse the vast Buddhist site and remain the most important employees in the province.
It will also take a day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which rely heavily on imports and exports, to compile normal reports.
The departure of the French fighting groups ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the follow-up of traditional assistance: school of girls, boys, department of French at the University, French Institute, military cooperation, legal, medical and agricultural, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) has been trying to "gain hearts and minds" and to carry out the task of harmonizing aid and action, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was removed in 2012, has led to the success of a small French NGO, of many collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation activities in mountain villages.
These works, hand-to-hand gourmans, can help to contain the insurer: irritation, potable water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in cropable surfaces.
What will we remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve local living conditions, very hard in these valleys often more than 2,000 metres high.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be freed from the surprise of foreign groups, what farmers have said to me should be kept in their favour of small civil, well-controlled and direct aid.
A Constitution to force forces in Egypt
It's a new poker cup from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which gives it the full powers, it has decided to play it all the time.
Taking the whole world of court, he announced, Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote for its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given this Assembly two additional months to finish its work.
It is almost two years ago that Egypt supports a provisional text, several times as much as it weakens institutional stability and leads to legal barriers.
This new initiative has only increased the country's fragmentation.
For his opponents, the President continues in his "autocratic deliberation", continuing to "trahir his word" and "holding the right".
On the part of its parties, it is ensured that it is one way to end it as quickly as possible with the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the fifteen days.
A very short time ago, the brothers were forced to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he has stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
As long as this appeal to a preliminary vote is of ultimate importance to the people of Egypt: "You vote for my text, whether I keep the full powers", those who are supposed to do so will be brought to an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange environment that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, a large majority of Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals lacked the appeal.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, hoping that they would not be able to make their views known.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to reach the required quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added to the heat, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Not surprisingly, it is most often the unity of the articles that have been voted.
Comments were also drawn from the fact that one of the only differences in the day was expressed around... at the time of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the pendulum of the constitution was wrong.
The text, which was still voting yesterday, contains 234 articles.
Subject to all attention, Article 2 of the 1971 Constitution is ultimately identical to that of the Constitution, which states that "the principles of the Charia are the main source of the law."
The Salafist parties, for which "the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, would hope to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a ghastly of their good will and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the liberals answered, which they saw only a short time of communication.
They believe that the Islamicization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular in verifying compliance with the laws with the Charia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing that "the so-called people are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premiums of a theocracy."
The fears of liberarians are also attached to the fact that the next director of this university should be far less moderate than the current one.
"For the time, there is no concrete religious involvement.
This Constitution remains within the framework of the Civil State.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ecumenical but university students, for some form in the French system," says Alexis Blueet, who is preparing a discussion on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used are used to the religious vocabulary.
We refer to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, etc.].
And the question could be asked about the extent to which civil judges are competent to make themselves known in the future."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticised because of its extended powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers claim that these are clearly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Other point of view: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a National Defence Council.
There will no longer be a ban on the prosecution of civilians in military courts, as the human rights defence associations called for.
The latter are also part of their concerns about the text, which they consider liberal.
The crime of blasphemy is sustained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no article no longer focuses on the protection of women, notes Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the President of Egypt had to express himself on television last night, events were scheduled after noon.
The Head of State's supporters will defeat them, Saturday.
In Israel, Saints, the World Centre and a Samurai Sea await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land combines the abundance of Bible truths, modern comfort, and a healthy nature.
Argumenty i Facty has held five major reasons to return to Israel.
Share in the Worship of the Holy Place
Make yourselves uncircumcised: the rivers of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who paints these "baptismal funds" will be touched by the grace of God.
While in Galilee, it is the land of Jesus ’ miracles: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus went into the water, where he displayed the storm or even where the fish was miraculous.
This is exactly where Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is good in Jerusalem.
The believers and walk along the Path of Souffres or the Path of Croix (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretourary), where the process is held, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of Saint-Sepulcre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the Peter of the Onion and to the tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Croix is built in the place where the tree was grown to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also opens the most holy place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentation, which is the rest of a temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70 A. J.-C.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then quoted.
Move Up
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, an ancient refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 Av. J-C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the rocky slopes of a 450 m mountain above the sea level.
Only the amateurs of alpineism can make it through their own means.
For the others, a telephony is bringing them to this full history summit.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m high, there is the mountain Hermont ski station, which hosts many winter tourists.
A boat can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski tracks take a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want the gods of the country to have used to be the summit of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country has nearly 300 museums.
It's impossible to visit them all during one day.
Here are the five most interesting things that really matter.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It opens the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the wilderness of Judah, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Art Museum.
The toilets of the printer and expressives Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are shown.
At Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths made up of visitors and observers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin.
There's no guide or memory store.
The entry is free and the donations are banned.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or the memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel Aviv, which comes back on the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, which is built at the memory of 1.5 million disabled children in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and penetrate into a total darkness.
It's brilliant stars.
You will then understand the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they have died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health and well-being
The three large railway stations in Israel are located on the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even the winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim there all year.
In this regard, it is the most unique sea in the world: it covers the lowest point of the Earth, or 417 m below the sea level.
The blue water contains moisture and keeps the bathers very easily, even those who don't know how to swim.
The landscapes around it are a surrealist beauty.
There is a treatment based on salt water, lemons, curative beans and various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also simply to slow down.
Discover the secrets of Antiquities
They are kept by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that links Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of Antiquities.
According to legend, here is that Noah built his ark and that Persian saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the dark streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, the fate will smell you.
In Jaffa, you will be able to explore young married couples who come to take photos of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can dance in the Roman theater, "conquering " the strength of the cross.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is today used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Notation for Tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: around 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is best to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shells (now $1 equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
For urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tramway and Haifa owns the only metro line in the country, composed of six stations and capable of relieving the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost a underground funnel.
The route in all types of common transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes at 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition meant to celebrate the Sabbath on the Sabbath.
Friday evening at sunset, the markets, shops and public transport stop their activities.
And work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many coffees, restaurants and hotels serve only the household food, which excludes the pig, the fruits of the sea, the unequipped fish and the dishes made both of milk and meat.
There is a wide variety of dishes based on pineapple and bushes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also on wood, traditional Jewish bread, different sauces, mollusc milk bottles, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many good food cats that thrive in the hot air.
We can see them sleeping at night on the roofs of guarded cars.
These felines love the past places and do not refuse to give them away.
The rental of a car varies according to the $37 mark for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Rent a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the cost museum in average 30 shekels.
The Language of the Digits
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
It was mainly people who came to travel and take care of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists arrived on the ground promised January to October 2012, or 51 per cent more than in 2010, before visas were cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"This language goes to Moscow": migrants spend money to learn the language
While MEPs and human rights activists are complaining about what the law on compulsory linguistic testing will provide, counterfeiters who sell "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, these are Central Asia's resources: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker should undergo a Russian examination.
For the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sales sector.
However, with time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of language will need to be validated, but also that of the History of Russia and the legal foundations.
It was necessary to validate its linguistic knowledge in Russian in order to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only the nationals of countries where Russia has official language status are excluded.
Persons who obtained certificates or educational diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are no longer covered by this Act.
Beneficiary, negative attitude and protection of rights
The review centres will be under the auspices of the Russian language institute Pouchkine, the University of People's Friendship, the University of State of Moscow, the University of State of Saint Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to conduct examinations in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This review initiative was supported by the members of the State Department and the Federal Migration Service.
However, before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question many times in the press: what is it?
What is the obligation to know Russia will change for the Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migrant service will be able to reduce the number of people suffering from "slavegism at work".
Many talk about the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will enable 90 per cent of the problems of foreign workers to be solved.
The problems are for migrants without vocational training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev's certainty is that the future migrants are intended to cross people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "road" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his likes will turn around for months without food and without paper and will have to travel between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised something, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken by their passport, and they are not affected by the planned wage," says the Chief of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many citizens of Central Asia who want to earn money in Russia are confident that they not only know the language of the country where they want to go but also write with difficulty in their own language.
This is certainly not their fault, but their grief: little Turkmens, Ouzbeks, Tadjiks can be allowed to follow if it is only a passive primary teaching.
In fact, their families don't even have enough to feed their children without talking to them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adulthood, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when we don't know the language, trust them.
"You feel reduced and loved."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be directed only to migrants who have a legal status.
Without a statute, there will be no formal review or follow-up work.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Come in or defend the entrance."
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the cost of money legislization: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, we can get a wrong recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no registration, where the cases of exorcism are.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy from cigarettes, of tea," said journalist Oumed Khouchkadamov, from Tajikistan.
"Be quick, don't slow down and buy you a beautiful work of art"
Since the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it has been found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be wrong.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by the federal migration service staff.
False paper comes out of a normal printer color.
Of course, their new owners had nothing to do with them: each migrants who looked forward to facilitating their examinations had to spend seven thousand rubles on this document.
It is twice and half more expensive than the official procedure: it costs the worker to migrate three thousand rubles.
The representatives of human rights and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper bags".
The authorities may grant migrant workers who have not been able to verify the examination of the first time to follow language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
Part of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to enforce the law against the perpetrators of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is a result of a divorce or a murder organized by Moscow's lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who has committed seven deaths.
The police want to ban the port of arms in cash in public places and to raise the legal age of obtaining the permit to carry weapons by 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the next State Court.
The whole world is not satisfied with seeing that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by closing the visa.
An open letter appears on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, require that they leave "that insensitive silence".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, declared to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and a specialist in the BBC crime.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, for a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a fire-fighting weapon in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market.
According to them, we can today find any weapon for a reasonable price in Moscow.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the device to the office
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are the number of five, as told by Victor Baranets, a retired Colonel serving ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Quarter.
Screenshot taken from a site using weapons command
The first is "the military track", that is, the weapons that have been stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons have been stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of black market-out weapons are those that are being dealt with by criminals by the authorities of the order.
Baranets explains that there are both weapons flying in police stocks and that they are fired directly to the police representatives of the order forces.
The illegal guns are on sale since the military posts.
Many of these recent events have often resulted in explosions.
"certified versions indicate that some fires have been designed to dissipate the deficit," the former military officer explained.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons tools that do not compete with competition on the international market and train weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is the opposition.
An important part of gun and missile weapons comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artificial, a mafia formed and organized supply," adds the former military.
Where's the gun coming from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was made in 2011 by the Centre for the Analysis of Problems and Studies for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, the criminal records and the public data of the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explaining the researchers, came from the army and the forces of the order.
Half of the weapons on the black market have been found "in the absence of employees whose work is related to weapons", explained the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons originate from military conflicts, 14 per cent are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5 per cent are out of "clantine fools".
A salesman and consultant who asked to keep the anonymity ensures that no one has long been buying the weapons found by these specialists in the clandestine mob; they are too old.
Most often, he says, sellers will search for new goods in military deposits.
The person buys by means of a teaching unit, for example a TT gun.
We release him by passing the march through a grill.
"He transports it to the city and sells it for 900 € by unit with two drivers," he relates.
"It is true that the police are running all the cases, so when crimes are on the point of being evicted, it carries out a purchase of control with illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
" Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and the buyer are generally found by means of knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy appeared and offered me to come to the Begovaya train where someone had to take me to a "coin" to walk.
The gun price, I've been given in place.
Victor Baranets in Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explain to the seller, and I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are salesmen on the markets, but there was also a need to come by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to send his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American points with the help of someone I trust.
He's just giving them to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
The new little ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schematics, he says, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "all we wanted."
"I believed in a luxury shop," the military recalls.
There's no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I don't like buying, go with the forest vendor, and set a target.
"Let me take it out and when I'm convinced that the gun goes well, we start to negotiate," the expert describes.
A bottle from his canap
The search engines show sites and groups on Vkontakte where "for different uses" weapons can be purchased.
To do this, we need no document and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," we wrote in public on the site "Buy a gun or a battle medal".
Users leave their application and ask their questions.
And we sell to the miners?
"Unauthorized, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"T. Moscou" wrote "Fedorenkov" in its very direct application.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated an enormous network of wrong sites and has gathered people who want to buy weapons of war.
People run on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves using coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, Observer and Former Military
I heard about this type of scheme: the site is generally registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer shall make the payment on the automatic charges.
"He gets back a photo and instructions indicating where the gun is hidden," explains Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the Association "Right to a gun," explains Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by applying for the site, we can be found without arms and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated an enormous network of wrong sites and has gathered people who want to buy weapons of war.
"People run on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves using coal in Siberia," he said.
One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal weapon, including experts, can cost between $100 and 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Association "Right to an Army", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
You'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It comes from long-term deposits held by the management of these medium-sized deposits.
According to the Department's official data, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the number of these crimes decreased by 7 per cent in Russia and rose to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of armed robbery, munitions, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8 per cent.
U.S. employees of fast food and supermarkets are in trouble
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a caste job at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests is mounted against the low wages practiced by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast recovery chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this vacuum will take the width or disappear quickly.
These actions are supported by unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the increase in the modest wages of basic employees in Walmart and in fast recovery channels, the organizers of the exhibitions want to obtain trade unions.
This sector is not for the moment covered by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Vendredi black", when a rising flow of money appeared to millions of residents in the United States and sometimes descended from scholars.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, who work in the world 2.2 million people, left their jobs to organize funerals with trade unions and left-wing workers in the company stores whose products are intended for consumers of moderate and medium-sized classes.
Walmart commercializes everything: cassacks through car batteries, aspirators, eggs and milk.
The products are 8% to 27% less expensive than in the large supermarkets.
That's why many ill-paid employees in Walmart do their courses only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart may be allowed to sell its products in the best way, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
These latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as lack of elevators or portable scanners.
The participants in the "Vendredi Black" exhibitions demanded an increase in pay, and they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the base wage at Walmart that touches $9.5 per hour, it's a sum that can't be allowed.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary by $12, it would cost $3.2 billion.
It's 1.1% more than it's currently spending.
If Walmart transferred all the increase in consumer wages, each course in the store would return to 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more than now in one year.
The Walmart MPs were pleased to note that protests had taken place in only nine States and had no injury to the group.
The "Vendredi black" continued in the stores at 8:00 a.m. the next morning and Walmart sold 5,000 articles on this period to the second.
Its caches have made 100 million transactions for the "Wendredi black".
Dan Fogleman's address in an interview at the Huffington Post left that at least five Walmart employees had left their posts and that protest was only a "operation of as many others" on the part of the organizer union.
"Next Client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and no longer dealt with Walmart stores (in this progressive town, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet planted) but McDonald's and other well-known restaurants.
McDonald's announces to sell billions of pieces and then they don't even give you any sick leave and you don't pay for the work you have done unjustly!
Juane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum salary provided for by federal legislation and New York is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-foods increase with time, but little by little, its basic employees reach New York $8.90 in time.
No one touches less than them in this city.
It's impossible for me to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after school while living at their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income there or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal's forum there are comments saying it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to eat with.
The demonstrators who launched the Thursday movement at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue required that fast-food cooks and cooks be paid at least $15 a.m. or double the current minimum wage.
They also asked for trade unions to be created in the fast recovery sector.
The U.S. Act prohibits the administration from making obstacles to the administration and imposes the protestors of a trade union by threats or licences.
However, administration rarely simplifys their lives.
For a union, the rapid recovery remains a difficult task, and that is, for concrete reasons.
One of the principals is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other mutulous manifestations were held near a number of other fast recovery channels.
The moment before the protest was the mid-day assembly near McDonald's from Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic politicians, including that of Juane Williams, a member of the municipal council, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of pieces and then does not even give you a sick leave and do not pay you the work you have done in an honest manner!".
The demonstrators were supported by other New Yorkese Democrats in their view, especially by the candidate at the office of Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must all support the workers of the fast restoration so that they can earn a fair salary and the economic well-being that each New Yorkis deserves.
The New York Times characterised this event as the most important thing that was known as the fast restoration sector throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people participated there without realizing that all were not fast-food employees, which employed tens of thousands of people in New York.
It's hard for the moment to say whether this mass movement extend will make small ones.
"For the moment, we're only about to hit the brain."
Finally, the fans of new technologies are used to discover the increased reality through special moons.
In the beginning, it was Google who launched this model at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had made the patent application.
However, there is concern with the director of the 3D interactive technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, which for the scientists of this company, the moons are already of ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the naked air, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and we try to extend the boundaries of this interaction at the same time.
The humanity in the whole remains for the moment in the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes on the touch screen.
We want to look 5 to 10 years before us and become radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect receptors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because the whole world is interested in command by management.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has done physical interaction, many things occur on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information collection has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance for the moment is not true.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D image systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of our home, in the physical world, to make it more touchy.
However, it is necessary to identify not only the user but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world through virtual objects in a more practical way.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality boxes!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she surprised?
It cannot be said that this is the panic: the issue of confidentiality is raised because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in his sleep.
For example, in order to command devices in public places, we had a project for which we are pensioned to ghettos, not large ghettos, but rather to discreet, restricted ghettos.
The gloves were not captured by the camera, but by a hand-held arm that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is now big, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a show.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- Is that what you're saying?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pen?
You'll be happy with the word and the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or does not do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of captures that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
It can be done, for example, by laser captors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect Captains, what do you not like in the modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, it is based on the current generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
With regard to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, which adds work to algorithm designers.
We need to keep the resolution in mind according to X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed is also very much, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are dynamic enough, and 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, gave the captors a regular delay of treatment including between 1 and 100 μs, the current captors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone doesn't understand how that affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would really need a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch, to have more frames on the second.
- But don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect has three cameras today, one of which is a infrared transmitter and the other one, a receiver of the reflective signal.
And the third camera is actually a normal capture of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or use it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a similar flexible product in Kinect, to play with the camera curve, and to see how this could help to define the locations.
- As I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its moons to the public.
Don't you think that from a point of view of the daily use of advanced reality technologies, the moons are one of the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitor" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass moons to the smartphone.
Lunets are a very personal device and that is what makes them strong (the personal elements are the only ones you can see) and at the same time their weaknesses: the increased reality from the moons will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's just imagine that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea point to the right: there is no tactical sense!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers do your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that increased reality is the seventh experience in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be a very good addition of tactical feelings.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
She's perfectly recording the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to assign palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interaction of several ultrasounds directed towards a precise point where the touch is found and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the lips of the fingers.
There are also barriers to the nerve endings of the fingers, and they are also a working area with perspectives.
- And did you try to break the brain?
Do you think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which there will be a long time to do wrong: the way to believe in someone who is physically located in a very small space that he walks into an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of course tapes (only with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms, and even giant problems.
For the time being, it is only a few years of work that the brain is still breaking down.
Here's what makes work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute fecundation state.
The rule of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersbourgeose Front" dedicated to the citizens who are in progress, to the front guard of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already been welcomed by prominent actors from the artistic scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city border and which have been recognized in Europe after being known throughout Russia.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is the extraterrestrial painter Kirill Miller.
All the city is known by Kirill Miller, this man rather barbu, all red clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the summer Garden or still in white parties and celebrations.
Kirill Miller's tables always gather the crowds, whatever their place of exposure.
It is one of the most socially and philosophic peters, one of the founders of the new myths.
Cyril Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg front guard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance awakens the inhabitants and puts them in good humor.
He recently took a pride in Barbarie and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersburg because he had enough courage for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his bohemian image.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city all red and not yellow or turquoise?
- I've chosen the red as a haircut specializing in the aspect and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between paint, image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray is caused by aggression and a negative attitude.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
All the history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my work was done.
I realized it was my way.
Thus, the vague of old informal paints was past and the new, free, in my nature, were incomprehensible.
I started reading about friendship with the paints of the new vague, with those of Postgazonevchtchina who was born in "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more vogue.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds of things except words.
It was important for me to find me at the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces should meet.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which opened before work a music and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the petersburgese bohem.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Ourele of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in play-back in moulant mails, including Igor Vdovin, composer today in fashion.
When the group began to come alive, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg did not have bad emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career started, but his basic training and education began with us.
Gallery "D137, Club "Griboïedov": these are the effects of the artistic clinic.
Our employees are part of it as usual.
I'm a hero of the past century, the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the price "The personalities of our city".
I was named the Year's Stone, and that's when my kingdom ended.
It is not easy to work in a new time with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a kind of recognitionable style.
- Many of my tables are hits, they have a very strong current and acuteity.
I'm going to have a program exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns."
The clowns belong to a temporary category.
Before I was a member of society, it's bad today and it's scary to be like this.
But with the clowns, everything goes off, the tragic fall.
I love grotesque, I have big ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory discharge.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but he needs to get to the throne instead.
And the lie will be wiped out by depravity.
- We recently seen you in the role of the pride player in Barbara. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who else can play it?
- But maybe the commercial art can also be beautiful?
- The commercial art has to be cared for today, delicate, liquid.
A disintegration of culture is about to occur.
Before, the people were divided into groups, the people of the forest loved one thing, or another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-Communitys, it's hard to spread across the world.
I'm not a hundred dollars ticket to play around the world.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to be.
Everyone sees 100 fans.
- But thousands of people are coming to see Stas Mikailov!
- These are people who are alive who come to see it, that's the sexual and social side that goes.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and the account will be less management, money, and everything will be lost.
I've got my fan, the main thing is don't bother them, don't beat the vibe.
When I was young, I painted tables that a collector had grown up on the side of Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, we often confuse ideas.
It is said that there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumerism has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But everyone can't work in culture.
Under the rule of good schools, it wasn't like that, the schools didn't understand culture well, but they realized that good experts had to be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who may be experts, but they are separated, because there is a need for higher experts who will evaluate these experts correctly and fail them on a path.
At present, it's the "king of taste" that flows.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this way that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are paintings that should be found from other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- Saint-Petersbourg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a land for this.
And on our rocks, the art has the bad to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
With us, this cup is very complete.
We have to make the art in fashion as was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project with support from the St. Petersburg branch
Hide in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate recovery or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with land on board go to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue living our species in a pest or still on a relief planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that we can conquer, it's not just hypothetical.
" It's Venus and Mars " , I believe Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the P.K. Cheternberg Institute of Astronomy (GAICH).
If on Mars conditions are more adaptable to life, temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to focus on reproduction issues in the space by focusing on the flower.
A half century ago, experiments on plants were carried out.
Four generations of smallpox grown on orbit did not differ in any way from land variety.
Then we were put on the orbit of insects, small drosophile playwrights.
In 1979, stone eggs were sent to the area to see how an embryo developed into an embryo.
We're getting a whole normal pulse at the exit.
Then problems begin.
" The problem is related to the fact that the pulse must find support, it must be placed on its feet and start to sink," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
When no support was found, the pulses were inseparable.
And at 10 a.m., the new babies were seeing their instincts completely atrophied.
The pulses did not react either to the light or to its light.
Unfortunately, they would just die within four days.
"We weighed their eyes twice, and then left, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev by finding out the lack of experience with the dust in the space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, biosatellite " Bion " will only contain species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetishes in the space.
In principle, we have found nothing supernatural.
"It was still biosatellite and then it was the only experience. It has to do this kind of research," Vladimir Sychev noted.
After landing, the rats in the area gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are still not possible directly in space.
That's not a lie.
By losing their normal environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
Unlike babies, man is able, in principle.
The wise man has the abstract thought, he is able to create a suitable emotional foundation.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the woman's body is what mankind has more precious.
Our movement revolved around and no one on Earth could say if it had a flight in space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
" No one answered that question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retired from the Fussai sector and space.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova was born to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and having even worked in an extra-vehicle environment, was born to a son.
However, the risk is gone.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have nothing and who give birth to a healthy generation after long flight.
"And if they are longer, this poses a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, the Soviet Union's heroes and Russian heroes, Valery Poliakov.
However, mankind must seek new solutions in biotechnology, the protection of radiation and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonauts Training Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in no fleet, cosmonauts enter the extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the tanker.
If the water is comfortable for adults, however, a foreign environment, for food, is their real element.
Little amphibian men seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby develops about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of her mother’s womb, it is easier for her to stay in the water.
It is logical in principle, because from its birth to its first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very small to forget," explains the birth instructor for food, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if the child who comes from birth is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
However, the muscles of the belly, of the bassin are rapidly absorbed, the ability to push the baby is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by supporting the reception simulators.
We can certainly prepare a guest in a special room, the woman will be able to make it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to consider this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the earth is not drawn, the organism does not form the skeletal or muscle system.
You can't dress a meal as an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience, which we will consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will result in the return to Earth of a child with a completely disabled, completely detached ", provides for the Director of the Committee on Bioethics of the Institute of Biobiological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in the space is still a matter of theory.
However, with this time it will become a reality, when the Territories return into their vessels to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (supervisory Institute for Public Finance Control) stated that " the control of independent Pseudo work (in Czech " Švarc system " ) had failed due to politicians.
In the field of public markets, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is in the process of training for its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Public Finance Control Institute, said in an interview for Aktualnn.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, it is what goes wrong with us," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practices the approach of the " Švarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister has recently stated that ODS should not import entrepreneurs with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be properly applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government may not prevent an authority to go to inspect compliance with the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee at the House of Members, you have referred to a Czech-German draft which has been compared with the laws on public markets in these two countries.
What was he specifically asking about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage the public markets and specific national legislation, as well as for the practice itself.
We have collected all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and better" however, according to some parameters, practice like this is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continue to develop more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project help you specifically, and what is the result for you?
A common control of this type should just contribute to our determination to try to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the matter at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any wealth and any criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, we will not achieve this objective.
It may be that this system is located at such a submerged point in the paper, that those looking for the files will find a lot more opportunities than if the threshold remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with regard to the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As for institutions, like the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised similarly, has a slightly different board, but these two institutions are essentially similar.
The competences are also similar, however, to some extent, with a cloud relative to our system: Germany is a federal structure, therefore it also has a course of accounts of this type at the level of different countries.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the State's resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are under control at the level of the country's accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I do not want to make general comparisons without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but certainly it cannot be said that it is doing better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I have no comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country we consider to be a model is also faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any opportunity to cooperate with our institution, would they?
With regard to national legislation, which has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public markets, has its effects already been felt?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet affected our control operations.
As we do later checks, we have to count with a certain delay.
Our comments relate only to the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "recognition of the risks of bad management" with which we have dealt with nearly 14,000 public markets - there these changes will be made very clear, as the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you, then, consider the adoption of this Act rather as an advantage or as an administrative surplus?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more serious and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulation, the contractor (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was obliged to accept that any violation of the law on the markets meant a lack of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the most serious law in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without resulting from the decision-making process.
Such a system will benefit from pressure on administration.
So what's the solution to get out of here?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the ODS should not import entrepreneurs with controls of the Svarc self-designing system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorised?
The law must be properly applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government may not prevent an authority to inspect and require compliance with the law.
He may say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he can't say that we're going to act as if nothing was there.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on formalities to be fulfilled and that is just to protect the call for tenders.
However, it is also tragic that a submissioner is removed only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and it is, in my opinion, what goes wrong with us.
The roads are by ice, but most remain practical.
In some areas of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also frozen.
However, the network remains largely practical, in some places with increased monitoring.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the region of Karlovy Vary, the roads were practical this morning, but by ice and also frozen.
Temperatures fell and oscillating between -5° and -10°C, but should be slightly remounted in the day.
The snowfall has stopped in the region, and it remains in the mountains only a final snow layer.
The crystals of the Metallic Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered about 30 cm of snow.
There are data from the regional road maintenance service, which was due to the wheelchair, visibility was reduced.
The R6 road and the national roads in the region are now in practice without difficulties.
However, surveillance remains to be established, for example, at certain points where the coating can be yellow and glazing.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practical.
It remains on some of its trunks of ice pellets and in areas covered by traffic.
In particular in the high-level areas, drivers need to strengthen their monitoring.
Areas of Pardubice and Hradec Kralové
The Roads and Roads Directorate reports on its website that some East Boheme roads are threatened by the training of snowflakes and that traffic-based snowdrops can be found on the roads in mountain and high-level areas.
Road maintenance services protect drivers against the risks of radiation training in the areas of the region of Pardubice.
There may be glass in the surroundings of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitvy or Vysoké Mýto, which is mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Switzerland were chemically treated.
The snow is found mainly in the Mountains of the Ghents (Krkonoše) and the Mountains of the Eagle (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a snow layer is present on the roads in the high-level areas.
In Boheme of the East, the time will be dry today, most often dislocated, with possible cloudy passes.
It will breathe a low wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3° and + 1° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practical, although, in some places, there is a need to demonstrate increased surveillance and adapt its behaviour to weather conditions.
This morning, the temperatures are oscillating between -3° and -9°C.
Following the recent snowfalls and the subsequent freezing, some communication routes may be by ice.
Drivers can expect to cross Broillard areas, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is what is the source of information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 vehicle is practically feasible, however, road communications maintenance services recommend increased monitoring between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the national roads are dry and yellow.
Some thrones can be iced in the district of Pilsen-South and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental and third-class roads are soft and, in this case, they are designed to guard against geled thrones.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on the most frequent roads in the Shumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers arriving in the areas of the Olomouc region, which are located in height, must now count with a wide and soft snow cover on the roads.
This layer remains on the hill called "Zervenohorské sillo" and on the road towards Videlský Kríž, after chemical treatment operations.
The snowfalls forced the road maintenance personnel to land this night; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most of the shoes are practical without difficulties.
" On the heights of the Šumperk district there are snow remaining.
The driving drivers headed by Jeseník must be expected to meet at the hill called "Zervenohorské sesello" a wide and soft snowy cup " has today announced to ČTK the head of maintenance services in the Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in Jeseník district have also been placed in place during the night; according to these latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now abandoned and damaged, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district the roads are easy to practice, however, drivers in the Šternberg district should pay attention to the noises in forest areas to the cold-resisted chassis.
Regions of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec
Since this morning, the maintenance services of the North Boheme roads have reported several difficult trials.
There are police data, but in more than a few places covered by snow or snow, the mountain route from Telnice to Knínce in Östecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitude, and therefore the snow and the snow should remain on the roads. In the mountains, especially in the south east of the Central Plain of Bohemia, there is no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulty has been reported for the moment.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of verglas, including around Štétí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow during the day, cloudy sky and ice during the night.
There are also difficult conditions on the national road 13 from the main routes to the border between Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions.
The closure of the movement between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that are curved under the weight of the snow until it reaches the chassis.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
That's not just one of these new alarmers, the kind of pieces in which we love to fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, we're on a regular basis rather than saying that we're the only group that can collect a lot of positive energy to resist or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a whole single project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project more fully to our readers?
It's a charity action that we've been preparing for for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 11 a.m. in the morning.
On 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end practically when the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is located in the Pacific Ocean, will be completed at 12 a.m. for us.
Who did I get this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, and then we got everything done with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave with our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded a hymme against the end of the world called " End of the Year " (in Czech " Konec sveta zrušeno ").
She's already very popular on YouTube, will we also understand these charity concerts?
Of course, all at last, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world is not...
It will be sang simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymnes will also join at a given time as part of a direct broadcast, in fact, uniquely from Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays Jesus' main role in the clip, Xindl Xy also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We cooperate with other Czech-biz personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We strive to make them participate actively in these projects.
It has been observed that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that they are impressed.
What will the benefits of these concerts serve against the end of the world?
Equipped with the Study Training Centre, which is available to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on the implementation of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association for six years.
Teachers regularly come to Jedličkóv's students and offer them activities that interest them and appeal to them.
Students themselves do not have the means to get to courses, we try to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the building of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Many music groups and interpreters will show on stage at each of these concerts?
What criteria do you have?
We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, you will mount on the Chinese scene, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in Prague's spring; we will also certainly prepare a quality program with interesting invitations.
We also like to play the next year in the Czech Republic's home in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to do well to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimal, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of persons with disabilities.
How will you manage the organization and logistics of your tournaments?
It's not so terrible that it's going to look like it first.
We have five members in electrical furniture where the machines must travel in support, of course we also have a lot of bags and tools boxes....
Until now it's been more or less well past, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything happened without problems.
With your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ for what is access facilities for people with reduced mobility, from the attitude of the public opinion towards persons with disabilities and so on.
What were your experiences up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we have just been witnessed in Moscow that all in the east is still in an initial phase.
With regard to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to disabled persons; it is not yet running that a person is moving only in an electric error in the city centre.
They are no longer considered as evidence of giving priority to a person who is in error in a lifter.
Fortunately, there is also an association that seeks to attract attention to the problems of persons with disabilities.
What else do we need to tackle the most developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's all about the fact that people with a heavy disability move only in public spaces; they can go to toilets, museums, anywhere...
This is not even very common there because a large number of disabled people are actively involved in social life, at this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather opposite the point of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities is a thing, but the situation will really change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or prominent lawyers among us.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, back a few years, what has moved you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as a teacher at the Jedlička Institute, where I was surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I am myself a musician (I play, among others, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a musical activity.
And then, in time, as our moderator Ládáa Angelovic said, we have lost some control of the situation (rires).
Has success happened only in recent years, if I don't lie to you?
It is true that creating links with known singers and working actively to promote the group has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
With the European Union's subsidies, we can also have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you have a goal of reaching such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of tricks that cover each other.
In a certain way, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I can say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally sweet, it's natural...
But pity is completely useless, because people with a disability are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
These are people who can live a whole life and grow up, provided they have the means they need.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it's not just a step forward for them but for society as a whole.
Isn't your success also due to being a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's all normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to the rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the streets for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and reach goals.
The Tap Tap group currently accounts twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
And alone, Ladja Angelovic.
We're an open group, people go and go, there's nothing we can do.
Our doors are always open to those who want or wish to join us.
This will be the case on the expected day of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012, from 21 a.m.
This action will take place in Prague in Incheba, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relations when singing the song of the group The Tap Tap " End of the Year " together.
The aim of the concert is to collect financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Multifunctional Training Centre Studio located in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years, the bill prevention is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was approved as the twentieth member of the Agency, and it was the second Member State of the former Eastern Block (the Czech Republic became a member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and has been involved in a number of agency projects over the years.
However, Poland's road to space began much earlier.
Already before the second world war, the passionate Polishs worked on space flights; they did not always meet understanding.
I would like, for example, to refer to the Conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, on 6 December 1933, during which he presents ideas drawn from his preliminary work entitled " Introduction to Astronautics " .
The developments of this young engineer (1905) left the cold audiences and in later years Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld received the award of Robert Esnaul-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book " Introduction to Astronautics " in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) then became a major promoter of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a promoter of the world's reputation astronautics, and his contribution has been rewarded in particular by giving his name to one of the critiques of the hidden face of the moon.
Since 1925 a train was built in Poland designed to be equipped with a fired engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is no longer clear whether the fusada should be used to promote or freeze the rain.
The only information known about this throne is that of the press of the day.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the fussies.
Research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It is based on preserved documents that this research has reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German army, research has been interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a photo-electronic chassis, designed by engineer Rohozinski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietbombamba lotnicza" by a author named Lelyy-Krzywoblockki.
These two projects were intended for military use of fuss engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of fusion technology were conducted by the interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczaswow Committee Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works dedicated to the Aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Tovarzystwo Astronautique).
For the first time, it is a question of a company in the November 1954 issue of the Problem Journal, which contains four more detailed articles on the Aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronomy.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international Astronautic Federation (created in 1951) and from the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautic Federation.
He kept his function until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has made a significant contribution to the ongoing development of the RM meteorological merger (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which has become the first Polish forum to undertake scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1800-metre platform had a length of 80 cm and weighed less than 5 kg.
An improved version was subsequently built, RM-1A and during the summer of 1959, two RM-2 stages of the fussation were tested in the wilderness of Bledov.
It had a length of 1,4 metres and probably weighed 11,5 kg.
The following prototype would have to be able to perform specific scientific work - the RM-34 fusion should have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind in height.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 merger was established during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM-type mergers.
It, designed with two layers, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A fusée had an area offering a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum distance of all these types of fuel was 37 km.
In the 1965–68 period, the Meteor-2 mergers took place in the Aeronautic Institute, and the first flight tests started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 merger had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful 10 kg load to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is still worth mentioning the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of the program.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court passed the Public Service Act.
This decision raised a lively debate in the public opinion.
There is no doubt that it is interesting to examine this problem from a broader point of view.
Economic systems aimed at liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in particular that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limit) of private capital linked to a restricted financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the labour price (rooms) generate tension over the prices.
It is appropriate to lay down the following meaning: a producer seeks to import goods sold below in order to withstand economic competition by " making the price more expensive " of the competitor, in order to obtain a larger share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
To a large extent, this means for most entrepreneurs: to transfer production abroad, to buy at low prices, or to disappear. The result is an important unemployment in countries where labour prices are higher than other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and even responsibility for unemployment, the social burdens of the State are increasing necessarily.
All this situation intensifys the perfect desire of employers to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this course of profit.
This situation is in such a public place that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
Unsustainable private capital practices in different economies create a situation in which governments of different countries are obliged to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own people at the expense of private capital without taking into account social exclusion.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to make it economically difficult for its own people to accept private capital prices, especially in the area of wages.
This is done by a system of long-term economic constraints and by the restriction of employees' rights in labour legislation.
This results in an increasing poverty and the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
In RFA there have been years of public food distribution for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already estimated by millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes evident that employees receive such salaries that the State is obliged to pay an additional to achieve the minimum level of living.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of practically all EU member states are undoubtedly a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are obliged to migrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with poor wages, within the framework of society, in the hope that one day private capital will be invested in their countries.
We need to ask here the following question: Where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may no longer come, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This is also true of all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the led economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital clearly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory intervention.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same means, the whole state.
The answer to this question is certainly yes.
The evidence is that there is a practically all-powerful lobby in all States.
As a result, there is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, by providing mutual benefits, in legislation where everything is criminal but not punished.
In RFA, the situation is such that because of the lack of financial means, national departments are delaying the development of law projects to lawyer cabins closely related to industry.
These draft laws were then adopted in Bundestag.
The whole of power does not come from the people, as the Western-type constitutions declare it, but powerful financial groups serve their own interests.
It is clear that the democracies leading to liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompée": "The State has been in full guilt for a long time and the functions have been attributed to violence.
The cuts of glass, the benefits obtained illegally, and the stones and holes were also used to obtain these posts.
Undertables and corruption would spread without limits and the people would make elections with already sold votes" ... ... "The honest people were never looking for functions, and it resulted in once the state remained 8 months without consultation."... 'We really started to say that the return to this difficult situation was self-cracracture and that it was necessary to choose a strong man"... It is true that Appianos had the Pompey spirit, but it is Caesar who has transformed irreversibly the democracy into absolute regime.
In conclusion, as in the past, the current society is based on the preference of personal benefit, without prejudice to the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and value the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today, as at the same time, there is an unprecedented decline in elites, without any effort to undertake profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a sort of break before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crises that we are today witnesses and crimes against humanity as we know them from past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution, at least for a long time.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international and internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be obliged to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms that will strengthen State capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Rein will never come out of violence and will never be able to" say Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the refrain is "not forgetting how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't have it," said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have been raised.
Some take the part of Israel, asserting its right to self-defence and putting the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others supporting the Palestinians, calling for the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and consider Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in his recent massacres; however, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer the readers a point of view that is "the back of the river", which is mainly of the tensions that have been lost for more than 95 years (in view of the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small town in the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others derive from my own understanding of it, or more precisely from the group of individuals, who is the main promoter of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of a struggle for power.
At any time, we can find Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they had their actions to punish someone who was leading their actions on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated between the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration will result in some powers that could not be done during a single generation.
Among the families with an astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the village (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
It's written about them.
You heard me.
Since the 1990s, they have acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to establish links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they have been committed and which have always meant for them to strengthen their power, to increase their fortune or both.
They have major participations in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or conducting wars against countries where they have not yet had such participation (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries was 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after only 4 conversion of Kaddhafi. Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resort to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Bank of America of Rothschild and was released during the civil war his own money (government, I understand) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to dissipate the FED, he was murdered in 1963, and President Louis McFadden was tortured in 1936 while he wanted to try a trial against the FED in order to slow down the big economic crisis in 1929.
Their dream of global power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Frenchman who started at the 33th grade, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eradicating Europe's great state monarchies, the second was to eliminate colonialism, including British, and the third should reduce the world population from 1 to 0.5 billion people (a large amount of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create one universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing but the beginning of such a solution), and finally acquire an absolute power.
The method used by the most wealthy family clan with their head the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following the chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to worsening the situation (see the creation of the ERDF to avoid any recurrence of crises such as those caused by them in 1907).
After the first world war broke out by the murder in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, the Habsbourg heir to the Austrian-Hungary throne, they destroyed Russia as a result of the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with a German capitalization without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Russia) and was followed by the murder of Austria-Hungry, the power of Central Europe.
In order to make it easier for the second world war, the Bankers have allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: they have, on the one hand, imposed in Germany a pharmacovigilance of war that generates the conditions of a radicalization of the masses of appauvres (they then have enough energy to place a sufficiently powerful leader, showing the duet of the partners, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, create a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (if it actually does) of five columns to put fire on and launch a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, including one of the branches devoted to the creation of a Jewish State, preferring the region of historical Judah with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above lays the basis for a massive Jewish migration to Palestine and the first outbreaks with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on the one hand and on the other.
It is difficult to appreciate if Hitler broke the chains in which international banks initially held it; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; as the war repairs imposed in Germany were at the beginning of the second world war, the foundation of the State of Israel set up a fire fire that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers are able to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be like her during the second world war, the first victim of wars, this time as well as the Arab or usually Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an enormous laboratory, the source of dispute and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it's enough to see how people divide strongly between Israeli partners and defenders).
Who is guilty of and who is victims of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where another torture occurs according to an endless cycle of violence, and where are, at the root of all, some individuals' ability and desire to acquire power over the whole world?
There is a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as with us, international banks offer people only their own elections.
Israel's current prime minister is a typical example of a fascinating, loyal approach to international banking, which does everything to start a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to the organization of cooperation in Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls Ormuz's fate by which 20% of the world's oil (the shipper has no width of 2 miles) and the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are they now in the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of teachers and slaves.
A world where a bunch of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new child is born with a piece of electronics that makes him completely controlled.
"They require all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry on hand or face a mark on red iron, so that they can neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this beautiful beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that one who has a good sense takes into account the figures of this sweet drink.
This number identifies the man and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a group of protesters composed of Islamic students took over the American Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had been in the United States, who had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. positive management, it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would seriously undermine the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had taken place on the establishment of a theocracy regime, it was not able to achieve the liberation of hostages.
It was a hard cut for the United States loan, but it was later compounded by the failure of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The secreted diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian Government.
As a result, a wave of solidarity and an anti-iranian feeling arose in the United States.
The Iranian deficit strongly contributes to Jimmy Carter's failure to face Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, of the actor and stager Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory in America.
Just before she's taken care of, six employees get out of the embassy.
After complex periods, they were found in the residence of the ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA has been able to get them out of Iran through a rocambolesque coverage: they have left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tour team who came to make excuses for the tour of a large-scale film of science-fiction.
Combination of genes
The expert's exfiltration plan for Tony Mendez requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the most credible legend, specialized stores became a part of this film project, press conferences were organized, and a firm's firm's firm's firm's firm.
The details of the operation remain secret for a long time, the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an insolent combination of several kinds.
It is part of a political triller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper moving", the story of a success, of a triumph - for example, in the ocean's trilogy of eleven, twenty-three.
The ambitions are: the sequences of Teheran's documentary style (in the sub-titled sequences there are iconic photographs of the event time and how, through these photos, the same situations have been retranscribed in the film, there is no great difference),
of the lightest passage of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exegeration,
and then scenes from the CIA General's district and other institutions with men who are accustomed to discuss the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the telephone...
Ben Affleck managed to resume his career in a remarkable way.
As a reticulating actor, he became a respected actor and his actor's game ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long-distance followed by the police shadow "Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the trailer "The town" (2001).
It's also the first film of Affleck that didn't happen in its original city, Boston.
The sense of a place's atmosphere is one of the features that like its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also proves this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is taken" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film appear in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the loss of the embassy is impressive by its clarity that also suggests confusion and predictability when the Sudanis, in a given place, writes a history page.
Affleck and his colleagues have a similar effect on the fictitious scenes (the fake tournament team in the Tehran base).
Too many objects
The stager had to enjoy a subject that offered only a few palpitative scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It was very successful, it sometimes added some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the crisis threat at Tehran airport is separated by a cut of telephone in America and the follow-up on the landing track is quite pulled by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lives in its distinct character, due to the need to show too many events in too many places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are all charming in their role as Hollywood co-operatives, their personnel would have deserved a bigger place and that is not, far away, alone in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a little dramatic tension, it is seen with a moderate interest, appreciation of the realization and style back in the 1970s.
It drives the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of another story, in some way, which has not yet been completed, and as an illustration of the outstanding character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and all-knowing, it does.
Rules for the freezing of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry on the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU intends, in recent times, to adopt a 40 per cent share of women for the management of large European businesses has been at the beginning of our decision," said Pravo, the organizer of this survey, Patrick Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women has already been made.
Up to now, however, women have benefited from living insurance rates because they are objectively at a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can signal by the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the EU's workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
For example, EU conflicting regulations include the obligation to add bio components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of using mercury-trust thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low amount of hazardous substance or even the directive on the size of dust exchanges, which led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of using the term "carriage" or withdrawal from the sale of classical ampoules.
The quality bananas must have a size of 14 cm.
European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of states (this is why the Czech Republic currently imposes claims on its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of the pressure groups, for example, are the origin of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be of a size of less than 14 cm or of an "normal curve".
The European Commission has defended itself by arguing that it was only in harmony with non-homogenic national standards that made trade difficult.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been adopted despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food shortages.
The first price may be reduced in this investigation to the EU Regulation of the last year, which should include a warning that children under the age of 8 should not be covered without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to an American survey where balloons are, among the games, the first cause of the death of children by accident.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age for what is to be suffered in hair dryers.
We also have strange ideas.
The following rules on European officials themselves are quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone who has an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedone" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Letez Faire" association of liberal economists, the Bankonnipoplatky.com server named in this investigation, in addition to the above-mentioned doubts, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU has set maximum volumes for food reserves available on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeds, for example, the volumes fixed for the preservation and risk campaigns, which is therefore a heavy amendment.
The organizers of the investigation considered the idea of providing money to certain countries because they did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to request grants.
However, these ideas are not original from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have the sea makes us sick.
We will ask the European Union for a refund."In the autumn of 2004, the Minister for Agriculture of the day Jaroslav Palas (CHSSD).
He argued that, as a result of our production of blue, and after the purchases of so-called "interventionists", the State had found with stocks full of which it had then to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have spent millions of euros on us, because the Czech Republic is far away from the ports.
In conclusion, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organised a call for tenders for blues from countries without maritime access.
Subsidies for the acquisition of grants were proposed to the community by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU), who had to serve in particular to prepare applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says that "extraordinary regulations are rare".
If the regulations often raise criticism in Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning as well as in its overall development are worth more than the delay.
More serious, for example, is the problem of using EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic is obliged, like other countries of the Union, to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific designations for these traditional products (which it does not always succeed) stems from strong emotions in the Czechs.
If, at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoukké vorjóžky" for what is called "Tuzemský rum" that rises in us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it by the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar, and not beet sugar, may bear the name of rhumm.
In the official list of EU-registered products, we are now in a company of world-known frauds such as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the Lübeck massepine or the Parme tribe, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the Carpes of Pohorèlice et de Třébón ("Pohorèlicý a Třebónský capr") and the Huublon of Žatec ("Zätecký chmel").
Pardubice's epithet bread ("Pardubický perník") and the gâteaus called "Cornets de Horíce" ("horrícké turbičky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm not just an amateur, Senator Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how was the idea of presenting themselves to the presidential elections?
This is not to be a senator or president who cares for me.
If everything worked out without problems in our country, I wouldn't be able to apply.
But I no longer bear in mind how the country has been pillaged since the last twenty years, that voters are not under taxes and taxes and the age of the departure increase.
I had no intention of becoming a politician.
But when I see something that I don't ask for, I try to get a solution to change it.
And since I am more than forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present me to the presidential or senatorial elections.
You have entered the Senate but you are quickly on the road for the Court (N.d.T.: Presidency seat).
Will you not then turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I've always said that I'm going to launch myself in the battle for the Court according to the results of the senatorial elections.
I then made it clear that if I were a senator, I would submit to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it's just an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the greatest mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation we meet at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we welcome all those who are trying to make the change.
This adds to the pressure that undermines the reputation of people and undermines freedom of speech with freedom of speech.
For example, I was told that I was proud of the journalists or that I was the counsellor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Court as a fighter for the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax statements beyond twenty million [of CZK].
You have to change the law to this end.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate in its entirety can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a citizen, I have made pressure to make tourism guide activities a free profession, and I have gained cause.
The problem is politics: when one comes to the right or to the right with a good project, it is clearly rejected and it discourages citizens.
As an independent member of any party, I have much more opportunities to get support from all parliamentarians.
I have the advantage of having the power, without classing and pragmatic dogma, to take on every part what is best for our country and put it into practice.
Do you rather think of you as a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people like me rather to the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, it's important that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are on the left or on the right but that they gather people.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the ODS and I do all the same indiscriminately against bad ideas.
Do you understand when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said didn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain ideal goal and a vision.
You're trying to get close to him.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am speaking have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without Parliament's support, you're only left with slogans.
You won't live long in politics with it.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will be able, for example, to impose material and criminal responsibility?
I have no choice.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to get them to my field to impose it.
If I were elected as President, this would not be a problem of direct transmission of television to the presidents of parliamentarian parties asking for the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want to.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President to direct suffrage, which has been obtained through the pressure of the public opinion.
I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and my visions.
I've just started politics and I've been trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I'm just trying to make things better, and if that doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and I'll go back to the private sector.
It's a little like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make the difference, so I'm going to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves to the senatorial elections as well.
I met Radim Jancura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have at least supported the investigator Jana Lorencová who revealed the frauds to the mazout.
I'm presented because people are really uncomfortable, but now I'm upset.
Six hundred people did not vote and what they did, most of them, gave their vote to a representative of the institution.
In the Senate, we're only two independents.
People have chosen a Senate that will make it difficult to make changes.
Nevertheless, I would fight for my vision, such as the election to the direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Do you think you're going to make up your own part?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is free of charge and then I don't have the financial means.
I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's yours?
I value about 60 million of my personal property.
I have in Prague a land of a value of 25 million, an apartment of a value ten million, an apartment of about 8 million, a collection of works of art of about ten million, an Aston Martin that is worth 3.5 million and an Skoda Superb of a value of 1 million and a few millions on my account.
In the past, I had an Aston Martin, because it was a big dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in the car, was flirting with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You roll in Aston Martin, you have a worth 60 million heritage and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money?
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I finish?
I've already invested 2 million and half in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors well indicates that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have the obligation to pay for this campaign of my own.
My campaign costs are globally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live in it, for example, to pay the English school of my son who costs 30 miles a month.
If my only goal was to win money, I wouldn't be able to make any choices.
So you're going to continue your business to live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in the chest?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the lead of the travel agency in the morning.
People wanted me to be a Samaritan who saved the Republic.
However, I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a entrepreneur?
I won, and I still win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the Prava newspaper.
The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the real adventures are not only a matter of imagination. To convince them, it is enough to record Spijkenisse and the newly raised book mountain - 2 photos
"I find that this building is going on, it's very futuristic, so something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the bottom of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large neighborhood, says, "Yes, he's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
People all over the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one's going from his full grace in one of these garnered libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a city-dortoir that has nothing to do with the gates of Rotterdam, holds a very special record.
The community of 80,000 lives shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
To restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional points that are on the euro billboards in the form of beautiful small thumbnailed concrete painted.
The success of the cultural offensive remains limited.
So the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back on statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam's MVRDV architects' office, masters diagrams in academic and creative buildings full of mind and often cynic, accepts the project with its usual flag and presents it to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a wealth of face.
And while members of the jury were still looking, concocted and hounding the shoulders, Maas, the face, filled his choice books by order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech with a "community heart!"
Here, my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-dollar mountain of the earth.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and some property and medium-sized houses for a total of 50 rooms.
In early November, the bookstore received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
That is also the case with this little iron burgeon, which so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pitone zone and a palace of an austerity painter, whose white faces invite us to think that they are opening a latary, is enriched by a contemporary architecture work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in his history.
The long way to read
First impression: Eldorado of the book under framed watch.
Of course, an elevator transports you to the heart of the mass, but the true joys of reading and architecture open to you when you dig the floor of the building at the discovery of its topography.
The interior made of glass is bright and clear, the ground in Dutch brigades and the elegant reverberators speak the language of the municipal public places without any fault.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public banks, dogs and small boys and girls who play ball.
And all over books, books, and more books.
"Of course, the biblioteque radiuss are along the façade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and unsatisfied," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely clouded the classic space configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the bookstore has been properly adjusted: the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical centre of the building are located in the middle.
A particular beauty lives in the black regions of the library, which are so many lamps, so many balustras, and so forth.
A new experience for vision, touch and odorat.
Even architects and engineers in the building don't want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project at Spijkenisse municipality, in a standard response.
That's how one day we found in an agricultural company frozen an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, it has been used since the years of synthetic membrane of a millimeter of thickness as a substrate in the shells and fields.
It's a good market and we get time.
The end of the membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in sheets of a diameter of four inches.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogenous and resistant matter, including the smell of both a new car and sports shoes.
The summit of the mountain is located on the top of the 105th floor.
Nearly 500 metres away, the literary coffee offers us an impressive view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potholes.
These latter create an atmosphere, but especially contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Life
"It is incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model environmental project," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal.
Whatever the mountain of books is below a glass watch, the sun shines only a little while inside, even the days of good time.
The ranges of wood-mounted pits across the glass façade serve as solar panels, intercepting a large part of the radius.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are expensive from the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic information mentioned above, is already at risk of entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of Chinese traditional medicine, describes even Boekenberg as "the final soul found" in Spijkenisse.
In fact, a few weeks ago, each citizen was invited to give a book from his personal library.
This measure allowed the lives of the library that was not fully granny (now 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are all over the place.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I think our invitation has created a particular relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of this building.
Even if that's not just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline called "the creation of an identity" in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote a new literary history page.
Even if she may appear young and uneducated.
It is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a sensitive political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain the status of observer State to the United Nations.
But then she chose the arrest.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin needs to exercise caution, as it maintains a special relationship with Israel.
But I also think she doesn't support the American position anymore.
Germany wanted to reaffirm its independence, however it was too critical for Israel.
In March 2011, in Libya, Germany had also chosen to abstain from the vote on the position of an airport exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany experience difficulties in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is currently reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to stay away from a policy so that it is defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Furthermore, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union is a complex situation.
The Germans are therefore meeting several fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used.
I think they're still trying to find this role, but they're on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
An external policy, such as France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy really mean for the Germans?
It expresses the desire to adopt independent positions of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position of Germany in view of the conflict in the Middle East and the absence of a United Nations vote?
Germany has first developed important projects in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt about a decisive element.
However, I would not be too important, because this is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But there is, however, a decisive element in German strategic reflections.
Does Germany sleep in its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain from important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I believe that the fraction is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
In fact, Germany has shown that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different.
In contrast, the United States announced their vote in a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?
There were always differences due to the American internal policy scene.
I believe that Obama's administration is secretly demonstrating a great understanding of the European position.
However, in view of the country's political configuration, the Government cannot fully understand its public position.
I believe that real differences of opinion are not as big as they always stand.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will note that Obama is far from being enthusiastic about Netanyahou's policy.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in reconcileing its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the great European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things easier for the Germans.
Of course, this would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today this is not the case.
They cannot therefore enter into a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
That is what they are doing right now in the matter of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will in the future assume a position of localism and will encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been condemned.
But I think that the Germans are well aware that they have to play a role that makes them more independent.
Is Germany able to play a role as an actor on the international scene, and does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or is it always difficult to assume the role of the first plan?
Germany is not always common, it is always uncomfortable and, for some reason, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
This does not make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, this is still the same problem: we do not want to be tried by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more sensitive position than the United States.
It must be composed of very different neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only decreases, but at the moment, the EU is not able to achieve this gap, is it?
The Germans will just have to play a more important role.
And even if it doesn't please them, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani become a Chinese Sudanese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands across the world.
Armani Polo... what really is it?
Behind this name is a mark officially deposited in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand was thus a protection such as the company in which the name was taken cannot complain.
And even if she could, she wouldn't be sure she would win cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer from Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violation of property law in the Middle East.
Every week, a new folder arrives on my desk.
Immigrants need only a few additional letters to be able to record their brands.
So, instead of Gucci, we're registered Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we're registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copying in all legalities, such as Puma, the sports item manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a classroom in which registrations are made to the Pékin brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company deposited the Zegna DF Puma brand, a name that the firm artificially created by adapting to a part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese became champions of the world of copying and violation of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are commercial centres in several stages that sell only contrabands.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his mandate is to attack because the Chinese trade mark office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that has already been protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpia", of parental marks.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say there is nothing to do with it.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," asks Pattloch.
"The mark is educated, the singularity disappears, the expense for reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and the costs of justice are estimated at millions for the sectors concerned, especially in terms of cost-effective products.
According to CLSA analysis company data, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest.
However, it is not easy to delete the suspicious records of the registration of the marks and these procedures are costly.
These last can last up to nine years, and the sequence is never certain.
Pattloch was a trial when the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period, the criticised name had become a "reality of the market".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant has no chance, he may even be forced to spend money on the beach, because he would have gone to his brand in China.
In this area, it's sometimes the law of the jungle that governs.
There are also notable cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of Sany singing machine, the same company that was about to buy the Putzmeister concrete pump producer.
That's why Chinese can use a symbol similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, the buyer of Volvo, used before a blue and white logo that reminded the BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The house of fashion Lacoste had lost against the pilgrims of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the view of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not capable of anything.
The Pékin CTMO marking office admits, however, that there are some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and space.
However, the office would have spent the last year of a "sustaining emergency situation in the process of work to a restored normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have fallen by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, representing an increase of 75 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain in the office.
Deal a new card
As in China, figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million mark deposit applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in charge of the classification for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also be worth the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of the right of registration.
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or EUR 160.
A legal battle costs a lot more, as shown by the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has fought against a Chinese plaintiff.
Of course, the Germans have been able to obtain that the illicit manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.
However, the Imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg mark.
"It is our fault because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Mark Office therefore rejected the objection of the Municipalities.
Freudenberg has obtained some cause in the following two instances, but the opposition has continued to fight until today.
Watching is on
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and rejects the professionalism of judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, testable and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the actions over the past hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed to the party a "great sum in euro six-digit" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see what it represents for us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Middle East threaten even to spread to Europe.
This would be the case if the use of non-protected trademarks was ensured by the owners of the region.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit the name of Freudenberg in Germany for a cheese and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could even prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "The watch is on. "
Pattloch and the German companies advise him to show great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to be proud of international law of the marks, foreigners should rather "record in China as well as everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler said.
Otherwise, costs may be much more important than those of registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay the opposite party licence rights for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we will lose our position on the segment of the market in question.
World Day to Fight AIDS: foot tapper, song, help
The Imbungai choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the Swaziland AIDS Orphelins rejoice in their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that's more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, basketball boots, ladies' shoes, and men's mocasins are looking for the rhythm by hitting the foot floor. Very fast, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly amplify - high, low, tenor and soprano -, they carry, push and follow.
Sister Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra chief almost loses his toilet shoes when he runs the orchestra with his hands with a wild flexible.
On Monday night, the Impongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age have come from the geneticist in human medicine to man in the womb.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy puzzle, each choriste has different words, all in a very exotic language: the zoo, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Be helped to help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are infected with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected persons.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is seropositive.
180 Orphelins of AIDS in the village of Esitjeni were found in Germany with the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them frequent secondary education.
For EUR 15 or 20 at least, we can become parrain.
This is guaranteed to the school's child money, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the gogo centre.
Impongi means "historic count" or "longing counter".
No one can speak the fluent language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, Choral repeats songs in this foreign language that she has joined in Germany for now into her native region: South Africa.
For 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the North-West Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the voice power of the German choir.
40% of the people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in slums of stone or land and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphanages, because HIV has brought their parents.
In Esitjeni, the lowest level of infection in Swaziland is observed: the highest rate of HIV infection and the world's lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF.
The population has never been able to accept male circumcision, a measure which, however, ensures a proven reduction in the risk of half-infection.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of the 30th century.
During a group trip in Africa in the spring of 2005, Chorale had been able to discover the village. Imbundus had seen many children in the street where he had not only the parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a school degree, there is absolutely no perspective.
At first, it was only some people who volunteered to spend a few euros each year in order to send a child to school and offer him a warm meal every day.
But later a year later, the choir was founded on "Voices for Africa", an association that has been in charge since almost professionally of Esitjeni's AIDS orphanages.
Sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial ISTs are syphilis, chlamydiides and blennorragia (or gonorrhea).
Current ISs are HIV, human papillome virus, genetic herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis powders and galle belong to the parasitic IST.
What are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and blennorragy are often seen in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contact between men is at least four cases of syphilis on five reported in Germany.
In adults with heterosexuals, chlamyditis, trichomonase, candidosis (fungic), blennorragitis and human papillome virus are sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of infection associated with chlamydides than in other groups of the population.
According to European findings, the three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the virus of the human papillome is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has doubled in 10 years: the figure went from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a reduction of a tenth in relation to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may lead to abscess at the level of genetic organs, urinary pain, white loss, lower ventricular pain, and the appearance of buttons and veins.
However, they do not regularly experience any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can you protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases may also be transmitted by lubricant infection or close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sex partners should regularly undergo examinations.
Most fast-depressed ISTs can be cured and late centuries can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, gifts, but especially the funds collected by the Koreans through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulated.
"At all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamin, a safe woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphanages are well accommodated in one of their great mothers, for example.
The gogogos, so it's called the old women in Zulu, are the village's pillars.
Some of them take up to 14 orphanages, offer them a bath and ensure that they return to school every day in their uniforms.
Orpheline, which no one else has, is in a safe place, in Khanyyle, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals for more than 200 hungry children each day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a school of training and has allowed the construction of two pulalars. With the American health organization's cooperation, the association has organized a HIV testing test for many people.
This is not about itself, because even if the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"The AIDS is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it's a matter of sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in the place of democracy.
These crimes imposed by the State, inter alia, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also disseminating the virus across the country.
There are, however, reservations in every street area, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, fighting against flesh."
In order to promote a little cultural exchange, Imbungi's choris go together every two or three years in South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people from the black continent still know about the time of apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it produces not only good humor and joy, but sometimes it also draws a tears to some grueling guards.
The bus always drives them to Esitjeni, where the Koreans visit their daughters.
Even though it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of Ezullu.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find the light," the people there said.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometres by bird flight, from Heidelberg to these corridors that hit the foot in the Bergheimer Straße repeat room, the light is also found.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercure
The Messenger's probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercure.
The glass layer could reach 20 meters of space.
The US Space Agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercure.
Although this planet is the nearest of the Sun, it confirms the ice water, as three studies published on this Thursday in the special "Science" magazine.
The Messenger's probe reported evidence of the existence of a glass cover in the region of the planet in the clouds.
This cover would have a width of at least 30 cm to go up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that might have hit Mercure.
However, no one connects the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life on the planet, explains the scientist leading the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercure can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
Discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
The inhabitants of our planet, the sounds, the telescopes and the little robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstitials through which the infinity is observed.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet of Miss Ceres.
As Pluton, who orbits around the sun behind Neptune, Cerès is not considered a "planet" according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomy Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family port" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink points, the most difficult to identify, are the "new" in the universe's docking room.
The Telescope Spitzer discovered this region where stars are born, baptized "W5", a very romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopia, at 6,500 years of light.
NASA's Telescope Spitzer photographed the glowing stars of a star dying.
The beignet circle consists of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the nebulous trifide, 5,400 light years of Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Telescope Spitzer photographed this Galactic accommodation room.
The Pleiades, also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the eye not during the night.
However, the telescope is more of a value to the colors.
On this infrared photo, Helice's nebulous, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is at 700 light years in the constellation of the Verseau.
His comparisons with a continent of land are worth the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo enables you to observe a spectacular scene.
Only infrared telescope detectors have been able to capture a picture of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmies of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's annals.
One theory is that the beads are the remains of a month of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the biggest and cleanest photographs that the Hubble telescope has taken is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the article, photographs of the spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Australian Observatory shows the nebulousness of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittaire, thousands of years of light.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divisioned, divided into three), because three strokes divide the heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers photographed the premiums of a cosmic character in the constellation of the Serpentaire: 400 million years of Earth's light, the waves of two fusion galaxies precipitate one another, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you do not like the technical abbreviations, you can use its name "austral fire route".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of Iris' nebulousness in the Cefée constellation.
The Nebulous is 1,400 light years and consists of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
We can see the circle made of black holes, which is 430 million light years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of baptized galaxies Arp 273.
Scientists named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebulous there is the group of the most bright young stars in our milky path.
The celestial sphere always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the cloud of the Rosette, are also constantly creating young stars to 5,000 years of light on Earth.
In this galaxy on the bright rays and covered with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed of a large part of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the vision of optical telescopes has not stopped growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever more far away in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Halle Telescope of the Observatory of Mount Palomar near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Binocular Telescope is located.
It enables you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The surface of the Grand Telescope Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of South African Large Telescope in South Africa was segmented to make economies.
The diameter reaches all the same size about 11 meters.
The inconsistency of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set to the vertical angle.
Its particularity is its great capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe looking for extraterrestrial signals using the Arcíbo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person owned by a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Extrestrial Intelligence Research") by contributing to your machine's computer's computing power.
View of the Austrian European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very big telescope"), a worthy installation of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can shed light on the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Telescope (European Extreme Large Telescope) is also planned for the OSCE website in Chile.
Its main view should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will consist of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clicks before 2018 as soon as possible.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaii Mauna Kea volcano were considered the world's largest.
They had two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea's observatory that monitors the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration allows you to admire him.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has released images from distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are resident.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The Space Telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent to the nearest space in 2018 on the side of a Ariane 5.
The first view of the infrared space telescope is a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will have a mission to find the light designed by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercure is also open to ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercure.
Radar data have shown the presence of ice in Mercure for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first orbit around Mercure, scientists are now certain.
Bubves daily from beer, and lives up to 168 years
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of dignity of Bible patriarchs.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where there is still a relatively young person at 97 years of age.

An investigation into a country where there is still a relatively young person at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is a failed romance.
Along the many routes of the road, the small bus covers the length of forested hills, torrential streams, and modest castles.
It's all green and fertile, it's almost believed in the Black Forest.
But we're here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few miles away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh, about which we do not know much, is that they speak perfectly of the Persian and the Azeri and that they have a very longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small city with its very aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree with the landscape of the picturesque mountain.
European tourists are rare here, the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is very painful.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is suspected that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Bakou has become famous in May through the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
It is the direction of the museum of longevity, the only museum of the sort in the world.
There we can discover the life of about eight tenths of Talysh in the region that is over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he's now 120 years old.
To have another child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Islam seems more than doubt.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man would have been married three times and had 23 children. At 136 years of age, he still had a daughter.
Would Shirali Islamov be mistaken for a few decades, counting his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock, also heard about man at the age of Central Asia.
"A lot of very old people also live in certain regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "there are also men who live incredibly old in Sardinia."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the absence of documents, without having any record of civil status.
Every day, a deep beer glass
Nevertheless, people in the region of Lerik often come to honor the Bible’s patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have distinct genes.
On the contrary, Fatulayeva, the museum's director, thinks it's a food issue.
However, it does not seem posible, from a nutritional point of view, that the rich meals in the calories of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially milk products and many who drink a glass of solid beer daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cangemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical of seeing them throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the floor next to a bathroom, where she cuts the contents in the air.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, who have been adults for a long time.
Two little children also play in the house.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for guests serving in typical armed wines in the form of winter.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under its follard are hidden from long grasses of a brown background that his son reveals us with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and that they kept their color.
"I've never used shampooing," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small fish.
For the rest of my life, I've never bought less food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments have been after World War II.
But everything improved when Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of the propaganda is strange in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the culture of the nation's patriarchal figure, a man who still ruled his country as a dictator, was hardly aware of limitations in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him.
Whatever the case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva has received monthly 230 manoeuvres (about the same amount in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good living train in the region.
And perhaps the son of Mirzayeva, who has been crying for a long time, has been saying, "The elderly enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" contained in the Constitution
The revolution returns to Cairo.
Relevant demonstrations reveal the country's deep fractal.
The draft constitution based on the charia is strongly disputed.
The President of Egypt does not have words of emotion.
We have to make the transition.
"This success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the people everywhere, but especially to the Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay peoples.
Because all members of the opposition are confused and desperate.
They were afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi stated, almost excuseing himself, temporarily restricting the powers of the Constitutional Court and broadening the shadows "to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, a doctor at South California University, wants to save.
Will the judicial power be reversed?
The 234 articles prepared on the table by the Assembly consisting mostly of 100 people during a night force tour of 15 hours are quite worrying in a certain way.
As in previous constitutions, the project provides that justice is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and remains an issue of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear Islamists using the vague formulation and the legal framework that led them to apply a stricter interpretation of the charia.
In any case, it is a newly introduced article which stipulates that, as regards all subjects affecting the Charia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radio spectrum throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative equipment, which would actually lead to the imposition of judicial authority.
Many aspects of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problem is the likely maintenance of military justice.
During the Moubarak regime, these courts were used to suppress the opponents.
After the dictator's death, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its moral and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematographic art and literature.
Of course, it would just be a censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article is prohibited from offending or dissipating the Prophet Mahmet or his envoys.
In contrast, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
The same question is the wording that lets us understand that it is forbidden to "infect people".
Is it enough to design a president's caratry or to tell a blog about the destruction of a man of law?
Many points are therefore the subject of interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and that, according to his own words, will soon be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution is over."
The opposition has been mobilized for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir's place in Cairo, promising to break the charia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is coming back and we will win," launched Hamdin Sabbahi, third to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to be cast into the villages of history".
On Twitter, the instant messenger service, he accused Morsi's supporters of promoting a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and we will return to it," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, our brothers' blood has not yet been exposed," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim conflict called for a protest not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
The blind women and the lashes, who participated in it in large numbers, lamented: "The people claim the application of God's law."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, affirming that "the Qur'an [was] their Constitution."
A fight for sovereignty on the symbolic place of Tharir, where all began, would have quickly generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Of course, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers said that the opposition to the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, were expressed high and strong.
According to them, it is now time for the people to decide by the terms of the leadership that the country must take.
The Islamic project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process that should have extended until February and encompass all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the Moubarak courts.
He didn't do it because he shared their concept of the world, but because for him human rights are invisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even stated once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World am Sontag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three forces disappointed the lawyer.
These measures are critical to the rules of democracy and will usher in a new dictatorship in Egypt.
" Instead of strengthening civil society, the President has given him all his powers," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot operate without civil society organizations.
Saeda is delayed, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologys on the Nile side with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A exhibit on the Tharir place warns: "You meet a monster that will no longer be able to control you."
Norway's Recife: Is this the most disgusting fish in the world?
Five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's success secret be linked to the capture of the places for an extremely disgusting fish?
Take advanced brakes.
Place them in the midst of a pile of welded footwear and salads.
Wait a week.
And you'll get the gravitational smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most caught places.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 o'clock in Oslo.
The snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, everywhere, fills the air.
The rakfisk consists of salted and fermented in water for a period of time - according to the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When darkness is installed and cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that is located here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat cru, then you take a glass of water," explained Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local pumper also called "Rakfish General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people fall out of small fish fish and grow into a large amount of wood.
"Some people prefer rakfisk aquavit," Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying some shit.
If you can avoid doing it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent hours in a bus.
The rakfisk returns to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the cooling, the fish was caught in the water barrels in the air and then sold automatically.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish comes out and - no doubt with the meanings of the tastes of alcohol - eaten.
At the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly moving to the United States.
At present, the population is rapidly developing - more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a complete health system.
The Swedish, their old rivals, whose country was not so rich for so long as Norway, cross the border to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital element, although adoring, of Norway's past.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is spent - a small beer paint or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international times, which is not to be spread to it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the extreme right racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they call this murder, they speak of "the incident of 22 July".
The Norwegians have a bad idea that in their peaceful country, one of them could commit such a barbaric act.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, Norway has to have its wealth in its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But the oil is not the only reason to justify our success," explains Anna, our servant, in the blue hat and in the eyes of a transparent blue, the image of the Nordic well, with a rakfisk plate in his hand.
We - how you say - are wise people.
Its English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to notice.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution - however, with the exception of a low percentage of money from this industry, it is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway had to keep the roots of its well-closed race.
"As soon as we can ski in winter and make the summer lunch, we're happy," Anna says.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," add it in a queer smile.
I'm gonna have to go under the snow and make a cake to buy me what to eat - I've got my rakfisk dose.
In the menu, a hamburger composed of elan, a true discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the fish's smell is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where we use rakfish to eat and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most honourable of them.
There is a TV broadcast where the presenter carries a cloud-palillon, surrounded by rakfisk assets.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score have you given the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here we go, Havard."
We hear laughs and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, maybe because of the abuse of alcohol.
Or maybe it's because of fish extinctions.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult start.
While President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take over his duties in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC, he is interested in the difficulties that await him and the people's expectations, which are numerous.
The road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the present time.
In a city where furniture is legitimate in normal time, a security barrier has been placed since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential chair to become the new president of the nation.
It's a complicated task to wait.
Mexico's economy is well supported by the results of President Philip Calderon, but the country is in the process of a drug war that has already cost around 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has committed itself to reducing violence against the Mexican people," said Mr. Pena Nieto to American President Barack Obama in the Oval Bureau a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before the American President, Mr. Pena Nieto was the governor of the state of Mexico.
A very popular and attempting state to close the capital. On its preaching land, opinions on this new leader are divided.
A straight man
In the bucolique municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
Its premises contribute to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the community.
To join the city, you can take one of the new cars from M. Pena Nieto, an important improvement has been made to these routes, sometimes bottled and full of creams.
Wooden plates of its name are added outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to make sustainable changes," said his friend and political alliance Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and of the Party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we expect a real change that our country so much needs.
After 81 years of powerlessness, the PRI was launched in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
After 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the members of the Olvera Congress admit that there are many actors in the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of opposers who appeal to the new president for lack of charisma.
He's a whole, very busy man with a wonderful vision of the country.
He's an excellent man of state and, above all, he can hear.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the narrow streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flaring.
Hidden under the highway stops, it is, in all respects, a bathroom in the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military were called upon to withdraw to fight drug gangs that live in the villages, and the violence against women was particularly serious.
In a sealed area, dozens of women killed during the last two years were found on board.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women killed there.
The tractors of Mr. Pena Nieto said that he was better able to solve the problem of perfect deaths against women when he was in operation.
Unfortunately, they accuse its administration of refusing to see the reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this dedicated neighborhood, Irinaa Buendia struggles to keep her tears when she shows me pictures of her lost daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version was a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I got to her, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," said Mrs. Buendia.
The signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the bodily stiffness had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana speaks of the wall, beside a cross where the word is: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has seen to be refused.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old roommate, a painkiller, a plaintiff.
They want us to accept what they say and take it.
"But this is not normal because there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his seventh term, she will be with a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has promised to take priority over his mandate.
"I hope he will be as well as the president as when he was governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of any ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
The prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning would have been victimized during the detention.
The trial is about Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case because Manning's segregation has been made under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having exceeded thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove, on Friday, that the army of Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the biggest confidential information of the entire history of the American army -- had missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claimed to have suffered during his military detention.
During a interview with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that weekly visits to Manning by officials during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
The counter-inquisitor -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request requesting that Manning be classified because the segregation was carried out under very difficult conditions and was severely punished -- one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide during his detention.
This military information analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, was accused of exceeding thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that officials had completed after meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers raised questions in Manning and indicated their answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had reserved for his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was globally "highly professional."
The complainants did not complain of any ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they were concerned, but they did not mention the problems raised.
"They wrote "no problem" (after dealing with concerns), and, therefore, this did not mean that I didn't have any problems," Manning said.
The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he was not complaining about his treatment at a meeting in January 2011 with the Special Commission who was meeting to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to modify his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below the surveillance approach to the risk of suicide -- for the protection and security of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted him to be removed from my status... to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning witnessed Thursday's arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Corps de Marines base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was planning to kill himself when he was in Kuwait and was released once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he had not been held responsible for what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very disturbing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, at this stage," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the most clear time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a table, a cover, a tongs, clothes and his moons.
He tried to stay in motion, as sleeping or staying longer during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also explained that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he returned at night, they would wake him so that he could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning questions about a statement reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after he had been forced to sleep not all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stay in front of the guards and other prisoners one morning while calling.
Manning testified that at no time he was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the court's questions, Friday, Manning said that he had refused his guard order that he should lighten his cover which could have concealed his innocence, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to lie.
Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep not last night, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elasticity of his sleigh or his tongs to hurt himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his subversives, his tongs, and his moons had been removed from his cell.
Its lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has had during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his judgment if he should be recognized as guilty before a court of marriage, a trial that should be held early in the next year.
The defence stated that Manning intends to commit the most serious crimes and to fight for the removal of other excessive charges.
The hearing should take place this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulation governing the conditions of detention of all prisoners in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the flight of goods or public documents, the collision with the enemy, the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the accused leaders are detained, the criminal detention will be permanent.
But Mexican-American identity crisis
He said that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who are involved; they remind Mexicans of the difficult periods, he said.
Navarret says that the Americans find themselves trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of customs and immigration services, I feel lost.
The panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexico" ("Mexico"), the other for the "External" ("Externals").
I've been real estate for several seconds, not knowing which file to direct me.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called "Mexico" all my life.
It's an ethnic qualification, as well as my friends from Boston use it when they say "irlandis", or my friends from New York when they say "Italian".
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw my great father born, there is no need for special qualifications or union training.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in one or more languages.
But I don't have an autochton vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I was directed to the "Externals" file.
I was thinking about this week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, at the White House.
In general, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preaching themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are moving to remain in Mexico rather than risking themselves to the United States.
He wanted to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for trade in the European Union model, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided any more details.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are complex and full of amortem.
Most Americans have probably never considered that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender in writing half of their territory to the gunpoint.
But for the Mexicans, who reflect over the centuries, and not for minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as a U.S. official makes the least criticism about Mexico, you begin to understand -- in the Mexican press, and among the elite -- how Americans deal with the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And Montezuma's children are looking for the bakery.
For Mexico, however, the most difficult relationship is that the country is with more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States.
Do you want us to deal with the subject of amortem?
There's a lot of it.
Mexico has its winners and losses, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in such cities as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one time, in our genetic tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a parent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person belonged to a type of profile -- a background, little taught, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living in the American dream, that we are going to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that it is the American dream that we live, not the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
We also know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humble failure and they attract us as if we were individuals of lower taste and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is a symphony of chaos.
If our families hadn't disappeared when they lived in Mexico, they would never have been part of it.
And we did not find the right side of the barrier, living in comfort to the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who had legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are conflicts between the Mexicans and the Mexicans, as Mexicans are more firmly rescinding their identity and Mexicans are opposed.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like becoming a part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexicans I know have no impression of being part of one country or another.
We worship the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springstein.
We have the best of two worlds, but we are not raised in either of them.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to make the relationship a little more complicated, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence want to get closer to Diaspora.
They want Mexicans to work as successful ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We must explain to our American partners that Mexico is a super-country that must absolutely visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen links with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much of me.
And, if we consider wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You're going to have to disarm yourself, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexicans still want them to do so in the way that their family members have been treated for so long.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old Necklace, New Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a barrier to peace.
Is there never a lasting peace between the Arab and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another flow of blood seems to indicate that such hope is empty.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, the rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab spring has done everything in its power, and whether it is due or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are affected by this regional turmoil.
Perhaps their fight will intensify a little more.
However, there is every reason to think that this could help them get out of this deadly trap.
A war that makes no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to prove optimism.
Although the ceasefire on 21 November continued, the fighting this week strengthened the parties of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will have tried to force the Israelites to abandon, even if Gaza has gone out of action.
Having killed some of its leaders and renouncing the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most merciful and surprising places on the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas has obtained from the territory on Cisjordania, the other part of Palestine currently at the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian tribe.
In addition, Hamas' leaders could say that time is their alliance.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is stronger, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a fully-fledged regional power, sometimes the closest Muslim alliance to Israel, has made and caused for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic states in the Gulf.
The members of Hamas are jubilant and say that the Islamic growth is taking place around Israel, from Lebanon, to the north, where the Hezbollah military exercises its dominion, through Syria, where Islamic rebels may turn to Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the mount of Muslim Brothers under the leadership of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, far the most popular and central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to spend in Hamas.
On the contrary, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily responding to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who will no longer be excluded from even Israel and America.
During this time, the parties to the long line of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was released in box.
The Iron Dome-baptized Missile Interception System proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America reiterates its indefinable support; many European countries have called on Hamas to be the source of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza's rockets have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been evicted by the suicide attacks, including through the barrier of separation that threatens the country, the main slaughter of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish colonies that continue to extend their illegality in the area of international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose part of the Likud merged with another more bellicist party, one of the leaders of Avigdor Lieberman near the election on 22 January, has a beautiful part.
Why are these Palestinian figuring out by giving them a status?
If they were to lead the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out.
Maybe the parties on the line will carry it, but the Arabic spring may change the woman.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and others appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to deal with problems in their own countries.
The budget for Israel's defence is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local sovereignty will not help the new Arab governments to organize their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a stop to what's good hope -- and could mark the start of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, privatizing Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dust that is intended to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that blew up in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is exacerbating this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years for Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic plan.
Both sides need to be moved by those outside.
The response remains the same for the reasonable individuals found on each side, and for the majority of the world outside and for this journal: two states, with a break in the territory of Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the cease-fire will give people the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which now needs to end the arms movement to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in line with the 1967 border with land trade and shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal from a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama was also interested in Israel ' s willingness to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present his own plan of peace.
From his return to the White House, he seems still reluctant to set up one.
It's a very exciting vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is the result of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for black cigarettes packages are in force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick bodies reveal the dark green packages that are all identical, whatever the mark
This law entered into force in Australia is a first world, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick bodies and the representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since this Saturday is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest regime in the world in tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government stated that the objective was to discourage young people from smoking by deleting all glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, 99% of the chances are that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children include the message from tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed for example that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia records the lowest rate of smoking in the world and if these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pressureed against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would slow down the trade in the black market, which would make it easier to access less expensive cigarettes.
"The consequences of this legislation will be disastrous," said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fascists will sell more anti-fraud cigarettes in Australia's streets.
Others have stated that this law had dynamized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarettes, including silicone to mask the terrible packagings, has increased significantly two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost it in front of Australia's high court.
Zico has said that he sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only time, says experts, is the popularity of social media and the cut-off of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on TV, sport sponsoring and obligation for sellers to disseminating cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work on the tobacco market and you have only a little bit of wine to promote your products, the Internet is the spot of excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of certain peoples to lambda for social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who worships Marlboro cigarettes and who suffers from making a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry is focusing on the new regulation rather than on marketing.
The industry has left to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic in response to these new judicial decisions - these countries have told the WHO that trade is inexhaustible, although none of these countries have had important trade negotiations with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the spring of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had had discussions with other countries about similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make the packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now being delivered in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More severe laws are currently in the study in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you rank the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which is a picture of mouth fat.
To be frank, the only reason I'm gonna stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the center of Sydney, said that the uniformity of the packages made it difficult for the packagings to be placed.
"Before, I needed an hour to download a collection, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had just forbidden them a good time for all and we would have said OK, that's fine, we stopped and we put the key under the door," he added, raising our hands in the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to wake up.
I spent five hours in a airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
As a result, I had enough time to reflect on the topic of the nest.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending a half-day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting Duty-free shops).
But more and more, some university students and experts specializing in the development of the child are at the end of the day.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get tired from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to use interesting paths, i.e. to feed creativity.
And as for most of us, constantly facing multiple types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of the nest.
So should we welcome the bride to open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, for many people, I thought the nest was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Levely History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The last one goes back too far," he said.
On the walls of Pompei are Latin graffiti that invokes the nest, they go back to the first century.
Then there's the definition that we give to the nest.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in various ways by John D. Eastwood, an added professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After conducting many publications and submitting the idea to a panel discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues identified the novel as an experience that consists of "a desire to do something, but without being able to engage in a satisfying activity."
What makes a difference in the liver's nose, he says, is that the person is not in the process of doing a job that she would like to do.
With the liver, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is in the heart of the bride, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad smell and the feeling that time is passing slowly."
The nose can strongly resemble a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be connected, the people who complain tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while the depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are alone when it is because of a concentration problem.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boreddom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Prospectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard from the next room their high-level TV broadcast that had no report, others had just heard the TV broadcast, and the third group had not heard the sound tape.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more unhappy than the two other groups - they had a bad focus, but they didn't know why, and they attributed this problem to the nose.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, an interruption of attention can lead to the kidney, Mark J. Fenske, an added neuroscientist professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study authors.
On the contrary, when you do a bad job, "how to look at objects on a mountain chain, music can help you not to miss you."
In fact, he said, now we know that when we are tortured or called, these gestures are often considered as signs of annuity, they are actually a good way to remain physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to Gigoto learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain free of charge," said Professor Fenske.
We all meet one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly awkward film.
But some people are more likely to be upset than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "Prevention Level to the End" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "I'm afraid of the things I do, many of them are repeative and monotonous," and "I have so much interest centres that I don't have time to do anything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to become more prone to depression than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied incentives.
But in general, adolescents are fast beaten.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a baby.
He noted that 32 percent of young people said they were nervous at school and during their duties at home, while 23 percent said they were nervous when they were not at school.
On the contrary, 3 percent of parents said they were nervous.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether today's rate of recovery, whether 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "youngerness is a period when the bride reaches its highest level," especially because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.
If I answer my question, is the bride good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it may lead people to take absurd physical risks, to take or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have developed a link between innovation and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The nest is the way the brain found to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the U.S.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you laugh and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child ignores himself and you give him an iPad, he won't get upset anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulatory goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child learns not only to have fun, he gets more master of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate the wedding.
I don't think we should criticize him anymore.
It is easy to feel out of the constant boredom that generates activities and technology is the goal we should have.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to laugh more often, but the bride highlights a desire to be in touch with something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to connect and appreciate the time of the end.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get started in something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new Marijuana Act
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, studying at a college and football player in Colorado, is guilty of something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana bottles and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the camps, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found Marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received an invitation to compare for the possession of drugs and materials that could be used for his consumption - minor crimes, each with a fine of $100 - and a date of comparison.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified without delay.
Police services have ceased to involve adults aged 21 years and more for minor possession of Marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
However, the prosecutors in the most conservative districts in Colorado have called for the acceleration of existing Marijuana affairs and continue to involve the people who own them.
At the same time, several cities of the banks of Denver to the mountains of the West are currently voting to prevent the opening of trades of marijuana approved by the State in their districts.
"It's happening so quickly that I don't know what's in store for us," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of the Aurora Police, in the east of Denver.
The Washington State regulatory agencies are also not in trouble.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of, before the positive date of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is willing or not, is advanced in most of the regulations on marijuana, first of all with regard to the use for therapeutic purposes and now with regard to personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr Smith acknowledges, can do much more than suggest what's going on.
"There is no previous reality on which we could base ourselves, he said.
The Washington Act, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a legal void for a year, while the permit system will not always exist, while the Marijuana property will be legal.
During this period, practical questions remain: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees appropriate access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a 30 km radius around a school, park, game or cross-country.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle Metropolitan Area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman from the cannabis Law Centre, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that "City attorney" (the representative of the public ministry) would no longer continue the people of 21 years and more who owned small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop incriminating people for this kind of crime "to immediate effect."
The Chief Oates stated that the police would implement new justice decisions regulating the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
At the World County, north of Colorado, the "distance attorney" (Republic Prosecutor), Ken Buck, places a more narrow view.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with Marijuana possession affairs, mainly in order to pressure users to dissipate.
At present, 119 persons are charged with 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are charged with other offences.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute these persons who committed a crime which, in fact, was a recognized crime," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were even complicated in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer compares adults for limited amounts.
The representative of the Department of Public Affairs, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all Marijuana detention cases.
"I have no impression of losing my time to continue applying the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado's voters supported the measure, providing a legal and government framework suitable for the personal consumption of Marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalentness among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"It's a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents persons accused of marijuana consumption and who acts as the local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).
"They have spent a good part of their life in pursuing justice for people who consumed marijuana, and they have also found it wrong to accept that this is legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are becoming a case of case-law for drug legislation.
While defencers and State representatives provide for a new legal border of sales, they are concerned about the federal government's directives, which always recognises the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defences of the law of the Marijuana expect the Ministry of Justice to break down.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under the therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has specifically allowed the sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police are not likely to force the doors to get small drug bags, it is clear that it is opposed to the approved trades of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, an former policy adviser to Obama's administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Before the vote, some local administrations approved moratoriums on the creation of new Marijuan sales, even if it is only one year's report.
Last week, the city of Montrose received a 6-month moratorium, and this ban should be imposed the next week.
"We do not want to find us in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find us facing a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the Community's vote rather than the State's vote.
A lot of questions are asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was wrong and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
This is not only the students today who are attacked for their views.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was a remarkable place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free mind and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to study the history, I decided to make my values, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father got tired and went to tears.
My friends were concocted.
The standard Evening newspaper claimed that I had left this university, because I had intended that students of the first cycle had sexual relations in the room next to the mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said that I was a party after being forced to drink in broken bags.
The truth was less important.
I'm gone.
Yes, I was, because I was a victim of harassment and made the object of constant threats.
Not because of my name, but because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single and only reason, and in this self-knowing breeches, I was a victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conservative Party.
Why don't you call that today, you tell me.
However, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of right-wing students is the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them called for protection of their rights, including those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative members of the Study Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt helpless" because of their political views.
They want a representative from the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary published on BBC Two "Wenderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of Miracles: Youth, Intelligents and Right"), devoted to the policy of the students, and which described "Touries" as eccentric and neonosie.
In particular, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OAUCA), who moves to Rolls-Royce, is a full-sized tree and moves with a chromed head cannon.
In other universities, conservative students are said to be treated as expressive mouthpieces for setting up higher school costs."
Luke Black, aged 20, Vice-President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", said a Sunday newspaper "that there is a lot of growing left-wing in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting."
Samuel Roberts, aged 21, studying history at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "insensitive", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, UCA president, said there was a deterioration in the attitude of members of the JCR in relation to people who are on the right.
"This is a barrier to the freedom of intellectual discussions, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think about the fate during my first weeks in Oxford.
I arrived in September 1986, then 18 years old and a paralysing timidity.
Conservative party's hatred was very violent.
Last year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - an old student - a honorable title, due to reduced funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinian vibrations.
From the first day of the week of the reception, when the new students came to know others and teachers, I had a preoccupation with what was going to happen next.
I found out that the teachers not only participated in the interviews with the Tory students, but, more importantly, they enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on pregnant minors, privatization and opposition of the Government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was buried in the forest of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victimized was a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared.
"Mr. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "Please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a dirty face, was easy to carry.
"Is it that the Thatchers refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students are laughing.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he started out of his pride.
I'm back in my room, inconsolable.
During the dinner night there, I was sitting alone and I felt a little bit stuck on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, James, who was presenting himself as a member of the OAUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid he's like that.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is taken for purpose.
It's already hard for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claim to be Labour (travallists).
Later, in the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That strategy failed.
A first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have rehearsals.
I was confused, Sal.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're touching each other, aren't they?"
I feel like homosexuals before the liberal legislation for the next six years.
Would I be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same points of view only after nightfall?
Would I have to become a Labour and renew my opinions?
The next three years will be like a purgatorium of ostracism and isolation.
The only open Professor Tory was Norman Stone, a modern history professor, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative but also because he was a consultant in the foreign policy of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his attachment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professor's position at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started making the boat between Oxford and the home of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredible.
During his studies in Oxford, in the forty years, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with the dream spells.
Even my Communist friends had inseparable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Let them have a chance.
I'm sure it's to take you.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
My frequent journeys to London have been made, and my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up on his convictions.
During a work meeting held the following week, when another historian suggested that I was the most serious enemy of the world, I decided to do so.
When I washed inside, I allowed myself to be the victim of my parents' brainwashing and the treatment of "old feet".
The rest was short-lived.
It's my father who has founded the last clone of my Oxford research.
At this time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my followers left.
When they left, I made my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me with a platooned powder.
But no 18-year-old should be victims of such intimidation in a school establishment.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 prime ministers, but also benefited from an inexhaustible reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notority "
As part of the exhibition " Valentino: a Master of the Couture " , this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Couture.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital to receive an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The curtier acknowledged it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that gathered more than 130 high-cost models created for his home of work over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his hostile Italian accent.
This exhibition is the pride of a story where the only protagonist is "Mr. Garavani", but who could not be written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the noblecy.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until March 3rd, a impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the aristocratic crème, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passed by Princess Marie-Cantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascendancy: of the modest curator of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jetset.
There's nothing wrong with loving the kingdom.
"At least they don't break their cigarette mix on your magnificent tapes like some pop music stars," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular guest and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all worship to be invited to his Gstad Chalet," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of beauty of the past like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notority.
And even so, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, bearing a Valentino model
Valeria Mazza has no longer forgotten the charisma of the curator.
A few years ago, after a break on the Spanish Place in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
He was seen and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, food, music.
"With him, each invitation was important and appreciated," recalls the "model top ", which began working with him during the High-Coture week in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go through fashion, because its creations are works of art," she concluded.
Nibbles newbie
Garavani's life is not an obsessive story but shared love.
He loves the tallest people and with the greatest titles and their love too.
One of the gallerys of Somerset House was transformed into a six-metre glamorous podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and has to stand on the podium to admire a "public" dream with Valentino's main creations, such as the size that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristote Onassis, the custom that Monica Vitti had brought in "The Night", or a dress in linen and provided with the emperor Farah Diba.
Among these mannequins are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norvège, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the driver in 2006
Many of his clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "unforgetable".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a dress, a shirt, a gillette and a dress from the 1971-1972 automatic winter collection.
"It's a gift he did to me," said Naty Abascal, one of the museum's museums.
"I prefer it to everyone else for his feminity, his great love for women, and because he is superior to our beauty," added the former Duke of Peria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and they shine the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionist Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can no longer forget the first time she brought a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her clothes for dinner...
Finally, this was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Princess Edouard de Linen.
It was a red night dress, with a flighty jeep, a busted bustle and a fall-down defecate.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is independent of fashion, he is obsessed with contemporary," explains the Italian aristocracy who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Arenberg's princess maintains the night's clothes with "the greatest care, because a night's dress is not just a dress, it's also the whole memory of her car".
The King of Mode
The great end of the Somerset House exhibition is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller held at his wedding with Paul de Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the curtier so calls his cousins) to make this dress in irony with belts, twelve different kinds of teeth and a four- and half-metre train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the superior authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high cost of the end of the 20th century, "the return of high society customers."
Acknowledging for years by the "know-how" of the noblece, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated by the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani combines as many honours as any husband of his clients.
"Its coolness, its calm, its well-being and perfect appearance have always touched my eyes," admit Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my big friends.
"He was imperceptible, years had no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says...
The world's toughest meteer: Kawah Ijen's Human Women
For four euros, Indonesian volcanoes risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilograms of suffering through the narrow stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 minors who earn their lives by bringing the suffering of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphic gas from the earth's entrances solidifies to air contact.
After collecting large suffrage rocks, which weighs almost 70 pounds, he installs them in two bamboo pans that he carries on his shoulders through the gaped paths.
There is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres high, but the porters are forced to record more than 40 minutes of this distance, at a turn of turn, while keeping the balance and measuring their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the precipice.
They know that a mistake could not cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who died in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen's minors earn 5 cents of euro per kilogram of extracted suffering.
Once up there, there is a road between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus babies, and carrying heavy pans, they walk 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has set a bit opposite to 1,850 metres high.
It is PT Candi Grimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960, and it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian clothes (5 cents) per kilogram of suffering.
It then sells 10,000 rubies (EUR 83 cents) to the petrochemical industry because this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to produce pipes, artificial lamps, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar-white.
"As we carry about 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 rubies (3.8 euros) per trip," explains Anton, who usually makes three trips a day.
Everyone takes 3 hours and ends up late, but this allows him to earn 138 000 clothes (EUR 1150) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a mystery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would win in the fields.
"The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid by 15,000 rubies (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million euros (167 euros), says the porter who once worked as a machinon on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rubies (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not too difficult, but Anton returned close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia it is also undisputable that he suffers: "I married a young daughter of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to become Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, everything constantly and her eyes are hated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, he spent three of his life at risk on Kawah län, but the suffering has already begun to pay him the bill even though he covered his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, everything constantly and her eyes are irrigated by toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to keep his dream alive.
"I'm going to work for two more years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promised in a more acceptable English.
Misleaded by life, this sympathic and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a servant or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a woman.
It shares an unsalved mixture of unsalved wood with other porters, rises every day at two in the morning, as the suffering does not stop for the night, when its characteristic yellow becomes blue and bright in the midst of darkness.
Determining darkness, Anton descends into the crater by revealing himself with a small lamp fixed in his pocket, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 gatekeepers spend the painkillers on their shoes from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not been able to extract the suffering in order to save costs and provides no equipment to the porters who work on their account and are paid in weight.
In addition, they no longer touch under the 30,000 rubies (€250) of the wholesale photo device, plus the entrance of the 15,000 rubies (1,20 euros), which the guards of this natural park make to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human women.
"This work is done for babies, not for humans," Madrusin protested, a 42-year-old corporate porter who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
He is able to carry up to 110 pounds, he will not stop working "as much as he can", because he needs money to raise his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I won't take my resignation, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the suffering destroys the throat and irrigates the eyes when the wind turns and leaves the minors in the smoke columns that come out of the volcano, they are so tired that no one complains of serious diseases... which are obviously added to their normal respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the pannies.
By balancing the panel on its dos, Unainik, aged 53, can load only 50 pounds.
Each day, his companions and his companions drew 15 tons of volcanic sulphur, which three trucks carry to the port of Tamamsari, 18 kilometers away from there by a herd of pigs loaded with bad fruits.
"I won't take my resignation, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth well, throwing several missing teeth.
The female of her five children, aged 30, also works as a sufferer.
Time passes, but the eternal mystery of generation in generation is one of the most difficult meths in the world: the one that makes the human women of the Kawah lang volcano.
Singapore Search for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are responsible for the absence of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my husband and a patriot, we fulfill our civil duty and give life!
It may seem unbelievable that these words come from advertising for pastiles, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video is replayed as a powder training on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Allons put a police force in the shooting" to move from Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the beginning of the video, looks forward to attracting attention to the problem in an amusing way through this publication.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to fill "their national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we can make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we feel it was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things, such as launching perfumes to pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they have not worked hard.
So we say the following: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1,2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it as lightly.
It spends $1,300 per year on politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extending maternity leave and distribution of tax benefits.
But all of this had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech state of Southeast Asia, also known for the conservation of its leaders and its social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was found above 2, considered to be the rate of renewal, was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Head of Policy for Marriage and the Family of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of goals of life and priorities, beyond marriage and the establishment of a family," she explained.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of celibates and delays in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the population's decline has created a feeling among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites that contain a painful xenophobic in the face of new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of drawing salaries to the bottom and not being involved.
The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore has been aware of its worst electoral results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with placing higher quotas and taxes on foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rate has a known impact on economic growth in a country, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this started to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, known as "Charse Box", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and their sales have a great success.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a life-style of celibate and discourage promoters who want to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that its "charging boats" sell much faster than the larger dwellings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built more quickly than those larger.
For this reason, it's much more profitable for our treasures.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidance to promoters, which would have been put forward in the streets if they wanted to offer too few housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state-state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the central financial district, it would seem that they no longer have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, like education, that's why people are getting it back later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," another young man of twenty years tells us.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of access to property and education as reasons for preventing children from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to child rearing, these are Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What's private outside the line is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about the quality of the private area or "the area of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What does this mean in the private field for at least 16 years?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses by spreading events on the Internet that would certainly not be shared out of line?
The newspaper El Periodico interviewed five young boys between 10 and 15 years of age, frequent users of the toilet.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on the personal level and "the word of pass and the name of the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not disclose my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has a account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not everyone else," he says.
On the FB, I post some sympathies or games.
I'll talk to my friends too.
"I wouldn't share one of my photos or someone who would do the stupid thing," he said.
The young boy admitted that it was wrong to publish obscenities, convicted persons, crimes, or to write humble or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them belong to the family.
In fact, her mother knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he added.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends, fast," he said.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He would no longer trust anyone who would recommend him as a foreigner.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The youth has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last one, he does not admit not to know 20 of the people on his buddy list.
"This doesn't bother me because we have something in common, music, for example," he said.
According to the young man, no one made any progress or asked for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demand it, I'd just get them out of my account," he acknowledged.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we have today under the name cybercarculation are not foreign to the young man.
A relative of one of my friends was picked up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"It just happened in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I was tired or nervous.
"Even if I know it's cyber-harp," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, professor of English and licensed in Education and Education, believes that, in order to lead children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but, with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she said.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, who has a teacher at Yale University and author of the book "Natural and digital immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital naturalities are them, children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who must teach them, while we are learning ourselves," she said.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a criterion on what they should or should not disclose, publish or say to an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective while what matters most to them is being popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents confidentiality is to use questions that they think about.
"They say it doesn't matter," she said.
Then, Porras enumerates some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do this on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to publish a photo of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify the photos of the parties, ask other people to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them realize that they have to act online as they do outside the line.
These are the same rules.
"On the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be the same on social networks," she said.
Monitoring
Esturado Guardia, professor of universities, primary institutes and educators, states that it is essential that parents read the terms of use of social networks in a conscientious manner.
With each term, they will have solid foundations to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what it is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is important to remind children that they do not need to talk to strangers.
Unasur's summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) was concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the present seven mandates.
Effe tried several times to access the document signed at the 7th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the United Nations, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency indicated at the beginning that it would be disclosed after the end of the summit, and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the government's website.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Olante Humala, in brief press statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The lack of information that circulated among journalists was this data from press releases from some of the Unasur Governments that were present at your meeting, except for the Peruvian speech.
The only document published during the day was the list of present presidents, which has led to some maladjustment among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who claimed more important information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of the President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd South American Summit of the Arab States (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it was requested by the press, it had not circulated the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously stated.
On the ASPA's official website, it can be verified that the document was published in March last.
In both of your international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Hague Court that deals with a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at your regional meeting and said that they would respect the ICJ's decision to listen to the complainants of the two parties in the process that Lima attempted against Santiago and started Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the differences that we are facing today in the international court," said President Humala, beside his Chilean counterpart.
" Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country in respect of international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," added President Piñera, giving a hand to President Humala on both sides.
The confirmation of the two presidents to be submitted to the ICJ took place after Colombia announced this week the Bogota Covenant by which it agreed to submit its decisions to the International Tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it would consider gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by the Unasur since 2011 after his ex-President Fernando Lugo was removed, has not participated in your meeting.
The host president, Olanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The mandater read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 project action lines had been established between South-American countries for a total of $17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he noted that the countries of the United States would put in place "a significant commitment to achieving the objective of South American citizenship through the development of housing permits agreements".
He noted that action would be taken to improve "cooperation in combating urban insecurity and international organized crime, measures to improve access to drugs, low-cost Internet access to the whole of South America, and to assess the risks of natural disasters jointly and effectively".
With a crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triomphalist matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and bring about a better future for our people," said President Humala.
"We have decided to privileged a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, particularly in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and by creating new economic circles," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru and were on the cross-border axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were looking at a more important connection with the Ecuadorian, although he had not given more details.
The final document also mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration within the United Nations of South America," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and good relations with its neighbours is another topic addressed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos stated, before starting your regional meeting, that he would hope to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, next Saturday in Mexico to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a trial of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Sedated), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not excessive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua, which will require a discussion with this country," he pointed out.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will manage this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are planning to assist the new President of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In the same way, in the context of the summit, the Ministers of the Defence of the Block will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the last country is suspended.
Peru guarantees the presidency for a time from the regional block.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should be an example to Europe".
The President of Korea, who participated in the 5th Summit of the United States of America (Unasur), in Lima, stated on state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "were interested in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they now formed almost a patriot".
In this regard, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the Member States of the United States.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as it is already the case for members of the Andean Community, is still the areas of reaction that we want to share in the past."
In addition, the Ecuadorian President has shown himself in favour of the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who fight our ears never commit nothing, but we, South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is unclear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself does not live up to his principles, but does not respect his "democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were suspicions based on which Assange would be transferred to a third country and that its process would not be respected".
Furthermore, he criticized the Swedish justice that required him to submit himself on his territory to a questionnaire on a alleged sexual crime, while "the Swedish law itself allows him to do it through videoconference, which could have been done since the Ambassador of Ecuador to London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health was deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that her physical and mental health is weakened by being buried in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It's about anyone's health," he concluded.
Correa notes that the asylum solution given to Assange since June in the London Equatorial Embassy, which would be the allocation of a safe conduct that would allow him to return to Ecuador, is between the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and points out that there have been discussions in London to find a solution to the strengthening of WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is found in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the attorney of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, launched a series of procedures with different European authorities," he said.
And he thinks that "if the Great Britain gave the rescue tomorrow, it would be over."
And if Sweden, as it allows everything to be done, and as it has already done in other cases, would ask Mr. Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London, or query it through Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm herself as a defender of the freedom of the press and explained that what he would not tolerate was "the media, the evil faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil or evil political men, but the evil journalists on the balance of intelligence, singing and exorcism," he said.
Under this angle, he was pleased that this was not such a kind of journalist " neither the banks nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and instead of putting forward its re-election, "the revolution would deepen to continue the path and lead the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the victory over Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should have shown itself firmly and not tolerate the opportunity and attempts of the defeated state," because, in fact, "that would destroy the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers that the desire of its Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the Hague International Court of Justice, will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They need to be resolved together in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the good resolution of the dispute on the maritime borders against Peru and Chile within the same court and said that it was "that Latin America would be better to know the international authorities if both countries agreed to accept such a firm judgment."
Referring to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to completing a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he saw this opportunity “with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult”.
Correa made sure that, if he lost the first of February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, power has never been of interest to me, but in situations as unjust as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who would guarantee this possible victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I had won, this would be my last presidential mandate and I would then withdraw from political life.
If you ever forgive us, I'll do it too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just talked to Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment had already been planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a recovery of President Chávez's health status," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State has now participated in Lima today in the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the United States of America (United States) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he confirmed the results of the test: seropositive.
"It's like the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to it at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "little penalty," in vain.
The young man hid it in his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform him about it and his arrest was as soon as he was at his 43th anniversary.
There is no doubt that he was one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit in the civil hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he returned in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the virus of human immunodeficiency (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmats.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying to him "because he was without a voice".
At that time, having AIDS was a symptom of death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "equipped" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after AIDS appeared in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's head of HIV, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and pointed out that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of treatment of the immune system presenting patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a level of 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who received a positive 25-year-old HIV diagnosis, "as long as he remains under control, he can live without problems up to 75 years," the asked scientist explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is today 76 years in the medium term.
While mortality has been significantly reduced in recent years in Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (in accordance with the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that, since AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have been killed.
In Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May this year; however, we are assured that access to anti-retroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why is there any more deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's what I see, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least, we have never missed drugs, the problem is that patients reach very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or then they learn about advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact that "nine patients in ten occur when they already have an opportunistic infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to carry out earlier diagnosiss and, therefore, it is necessary to propose mass testing for all those who ask for it."
Specialists and members of the Jalisco AIDS Prevention Council (Coesida) agree on their proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to carry out their screening test in a private laboratory just because a friend had done it and that, despite his youth, he was already a victim of AIDS and suffered from the cancerous tumor in Kaposi, which is one of the current complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I wake up three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medications.
Today, his parents only know he's suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active, but responsible sexual life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILLENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the course of the World Day against AIDS.
If they've done the test, if they've taken risks, they'll soon find out if they're positive and better this evening, and if they already have diagnosis, they need to know that we can live as everyone else, being responsible.
Its message summarizes the slogan of the anti-AIDS battle in 2012.
Conservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, supported by Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara, who excommunicated the cause of HIV.
And the biggest resident in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, and now we are given 100 packages, it is very good, but as a result, that today some have not access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question, "What are you going to do about it?", which is put in the hands of social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents don't want to hear, ensure the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that conservationists are not only sold to accountants, but are found in the distributors of public toilets and in places where young people frequent.
It's not about encouraging promiscuousness.
It is no longer a matter of paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had answered when asked if there would be a distribution of conservatives within his administration.
"It's not like what sex works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
13,435 cases have been reported (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in a number of new cases and cases of AIDS and 13th cases for the number of HIV diseases.
92% of the contamination is sexual, 6% by blood, and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, because for every recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
A judgement ratified by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro debt group through a commercial failure in Mexico. The scenario causes a negative precedent for all national companies with restrictions in the neighbouring countries and with problems of solvency.
It should therefore be said that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the starboard, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the court-martial court rendered on June 15th by Judge Harlin Hall of the Court of the Failures of the North Texas District of Texas leaves Mexican companies undefended to face the possibility of embargoing their property beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution would allow the main wine manufacturer from Mexico to obtain the United States Supreme Court, based on three incoherences.
First, while the judge of the cause indicates that creditors are required to register under the U.S. failure law, the appeal court of the fifth circuit, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main procedure is the formalised commercial failure in Mexico.
The first point would involve discontinuing international cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Equality of Commercial International Law had been created to that end by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the inter-corporate vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial failure, the debts contracted by the Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring would not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are about a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Errors has guaranteed debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the branches remain, in all respects the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States courts, the "wautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited would not have been obtained by the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data submitted by the Appeals Tribunal.
On the other hand, Vitro was bloated for the difficult situation he has had since 2008 without stopping the serious economic crisis facing the United States, affecting the costs of the country.
For the moment, the family of González Sada will appeal to the same court for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is, with the five judges, because only three had voted.
In this case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States shall declare the non-profit and require the revision of the proceedings by a higher authority.
The most important thing is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the Carey Friends ("the Friends of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Trade Errors Act was detailed, noting that it would release the conventions signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Errors Act.
Furthermore, it notes that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Marking of two parts: they are absorbed by Vitro and they are absorbed by the country.
General
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Association against the former parent of the company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, have been silenced for several months, which has been accused of mismanagement, and the Association of the Aviation Pilots has already encountered problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Moreneau, has just filed a criminal appeal against the National Banking Commission and the Valeurs accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has systematically provided information to the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw F/589 from the Bank of IXE 198 million weights on behalf of Mexicoan de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of works by the Professional Department of Hotels.
As each knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're assigned to Dragon Mart.
Meetings last week in an amphitheater of the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society have approved the establishment of a broad opposition front at the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we're talking about a colossal center for sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the big wall, with a living area for employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the Governments of the South-East region in order to oppose the monumental project, which is part of the protected areas and represents the greatest threat to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The Government has put forward a request from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Anti-Contrafaçon Commercial Agreement, known as the ACTA's English seal, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already from ancient history.
As everyone knows, it has been well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was considered an obstacle to freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting those in the short term, the real estate promoter Homex launched on the market of the Value Book for 500 million weights.
This issue of titles is the first of the four issues for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Born of Competival
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet companies, information leaders, a new Consortium for Competival's social reasons comes from birth, whose objective will be the market for software clustering in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is all my life"
The globalist of the "Hetin" ball ball bat has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, thanks to it, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral haemorrhage did not condemn him in 2008, Reyes was involved in this sport for more than 60 years, either as a player of lower leagues, as a national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball Federation.
"I have carried a number of tapes in the basketball game all along my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the federation for the 1990s," Reyes recalls when he was visited by Primer Hora in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful husband for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind his tour beyond standards, testify to it.
Bayamón in the heart
From all his memories, his favorites are those who remind him of his past as a player within the Vacheros team in the mid-50s to 1982, after 15 years as co-man or team manager.
"It was my best years, which I have enjoyed most because I have had the chance to participate in eight Vacero champions since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
This has taken many years of satisfaction, including the five campaigns from 1971 to 1975.
I was then removed from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the team's head," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leading here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
It's like it's starting Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manuto of the federation.
At that time, he would prefer to take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the U.S. in the Mexican pre-Olympic tournament in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World, where we arrived 4th and where we had to win the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not given us the last match, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
It is part of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team during the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my preference is that of the Cuban Pan American Games in 1991, when we won the gold and we joined the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that had won the bronze during the World.
This team was not only composed of Mindy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but it also had young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend the 90th world due to a gender problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy during the pre-Olympic tour of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner instead of the players suspended by the improble of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all pronosics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt, it's called Piculin Ortiz.
Its statistics at the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as did Piculin.
And that without taking into account his trajectory in the different links he played.
Who was the best Portuguese leader?
It's very hard to say.
We have a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
As a young person, I love the work that Leo Ariel does.
For you, what is your greatest success within the federation?
It has been part of the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that by the early 1990s, the BSN accounted for up to 17 teams in one season.
What are you gonna do?
There are things I would like to put into place, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, field personnel and arbitration.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my little kids, and, in time, I attend basketball matches.
And of course, I'm benefiting from my husband's company, Isabel, who has always been on my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became known worldwide by John Ross Ewing's main role, known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he enrolled a man of business with no scrutinizing, regular and manipulating.
Larry Hagman, whose role as a magnet for the non-speech oil-free J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" television series became a symbol of the adventure in the 1980s, was destroyed.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday night of complications of cancer, according to a family communication sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., Dallas production house.
"Lary was about to return to her hometown of Dallas, again playing the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this day's holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of her husband in the original series and then was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, declared his press attack, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, dreamy, loving and talented, and he's going to miss me a lot.
"He was an exception, and he lived a deep life," said Gray in a communiqué.
Doctors had diagnosed a liver surgeon in Larry Hagman in 1992 and had recognized that he had had a lot of kidney disease for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a severe liver tumor and had a seizure.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman was introduced to television in the role of an ordinary type in the "Jinny of My Dreams" series distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In that, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a sedative genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he took it home.
He also played in two comedys that were short-lived, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its role in the film are the well-known roles of the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But this was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the malicious J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their neighbours were distributed from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", designed to maintain the suspension around a full-emotional episode in which Hagman's personality is almost murdered, generated speculations worldwide and millions of dollars played in Paris.
As a result, the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million television viewers were on their screen and made Dallas the second most popular entertainment program in the world, after the final “MASH” episode in 1983, which had collected 50 million TV viewers.
It was the beautiful sister of J.R., Kristin (translated by Mary Crosby) who had pulled him up.
J.R. had set him up and then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if he did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but in a charismatic dream: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to interfere with his alcoholic husband Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what would be an epithet for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write: "Look at the honesty of J.R. Ewing citizens."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Major Victoria, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a "immortal man, on both the small screen and in life".
It is inevitable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans across the world, and in the heart of each one of us, who had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were published a few months ago with a great success on the TNT chain.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, reported the chain.
For the moment, neither Warner nor TNT chain have communicated how the death of Hagman will be integrated into the series.
Fort Worth's original in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who knows the celebrity with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first step on the stage of New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
This is where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and had lived in the California city of Malibu for many years.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tal (and absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s imputable memories)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he said to the press at the time.
After his liver seizure, he became an active soldier of the organ gift and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help the concerned patients.
"I advise them, I trust them, I come with them when they come to work and then," he relates in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going well."
He was also militarized against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with "The End of the World" has just begun.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate recovery.
This evening, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course at the end of the world, he knew that he had launched an irresponsible harvest: the end of the "great discovery" of the Maya calendar on December 21, which refers to many people as evidence of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what he was expecting during the following months: the hurricane Sandy, a tax deficit that some have called "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists at the end of time thought that the apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what's happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we were talking about it, that was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will be, in theory, the last of history.
In the Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker offers the course "Media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate recovery.
"We will analyze this because these ideas extend over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios leads to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
In this month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and learn how they can be compared to real life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of state of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art and Anthropology history, made a course, just entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" in order to have the opportunity to resume the course, where the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "morning disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final review will take place in the wake of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the end of the supposed world", Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received messages by e-mail several weeks before the start of the semester, by the party who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It makes me wonder what people can do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old Psychology and Infirmary student, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and less than one professor, told us that we believed in the end of the 21st December world.
"Our first project was the Maya prophecy, and in some way we have disreputed it," says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old student at Temple, from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I realize that there is a concern related to apocalypse in Western culture, which has taken place for centuries, making people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a lot of this speculation.
"In other places around the globe, people don't think about it," he says.
This is most of the Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Hall that year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that there were courses on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception coming from a higher authority.
We have a favor from the Father.
Again notes that over the past few years, there have been many dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start thinking immediately about the next date" or philosopher on the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date to school.
Many told us they were thinking about going to "the end of the world."
"Sometimes, I call friends and we're in trouble together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student.
