Cumulative insiden coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased rapidly in the European Union/Weliah Economics Europe and England Raya, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a train similar to that in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom confirm that, although it is different depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experiences of Italy, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit, it should increase its preparedness for COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the pneumonic class of etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On January 9, 2020, the Tingkok Disease Control and Prevention Centre reported this disease's infectious agent as a new coronavirus, now called the acute weapon syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence has so far shown that approximately 80% of COVID-19 sufferers suffer from mild, severe respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with most of this suffering is healed.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed a more severe disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of the other cases experienced critical diseases that needed intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated in the hospital resulted in approximately 4% of COVID-19.
In this study, we examined the COVID-19 U.S. economy (EU/EEA) and England Raya (UK) incineration in the province of Hubei, Tiongkok.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases now in the EU/EEA country and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in the EU/EEA country and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 experienced a far longer geographical preaching and dynamicization of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world at this time following the pandemic in Tiongkok.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the Eurovision 2020 issue of 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 cases confirmed on the basis of WHO definition of cases.
In the EU/EEA, three cases were confirmed first reported by France on 24 January 2020 to those who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected throughout 30 EU/EEA and Ingris Raya (UK) countries, between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get cumulative classes and cumulativeincidence of the COVID-19 cases
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of cases identified by COVID-19 in each country worldwide was announced every day at 8.00. This percentage is available only from official sources such as the State Health Review, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to examine COVID-19 trains in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare it to trains in Italy.
As an active COVID-19 prevalence proximal, we count the cumulative insidized 14 days, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK, during the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also have the cumulative number of cases reported in each country until March 15, 2020 at 8.00 compared with Italy's case during the period 31 January– 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA country and UK
Cumulative insidant train died 14 days in the EU/EEA country and the UK generally followed train in Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Gambar 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United States as a whole, the COVID-19 cumulative incidence began to rise about 21 February and then increased by about 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This train is primarily driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar cumulative insidisation train COVID-19 (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA country and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
The data suggest that by March 15th at 8.00, 15 other EU/EA countries and the United Nations have reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italy's cases three weeks earlier or less.
As a result, we indicated that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increased rapidly in EU/EEA and the UK.
A trained train on the COVID-19 cumulative insidity indicates that pandemics increase at a similar rate in all countries.
This is clear from the differences between countries, the variations in public health responses, and the possible differences in the definition of cases between countries and the different protocols to select patients to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, which includes a test.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who appeared to explain the situation of around 10% of patients with COVID-19 need intensive care and media resources to report that hospitals and intensive care units in this area have reached the maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 cases are received at the hospital and/or intensive treatment units at EU/EAA level only 6% and 1% are available for each case (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete the monitoring data now focused on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths reported.
A study conducted in 2010-2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of intensive sleep care and medical care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less energy resources compared with Italy (12,5 places of intensive care and media care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario is related to the complexity of health care capacity, with the estimate of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA and UK risk-related countries >90% over the capacity of intensive care facilities, prepared in the six-year transmission of ECDC risk assessment on COVID-19.
Because these far-class cases are classified in certain parts of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of certain regional services, information on cases and places of intensive care should be prepared at the United Nations Statistics level (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and the current train in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients who need health care, especially intensive care, as is done in Italy.
As demonstrated in the recent risk assessment of ECDC, rapid, proactive, and compression is very important to slow the SARS-CoV-2 preaching, with the exception of an increase in the protection to the medicature, due to an increase in the number of cases, such as the diagnosis, may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if it is not previously established.
The rapid risk assessment also introduces social health measures to examine the impact of pandemics.
There is a short-term opportunity window when the country has the possibility of increasing its control by speeding up SARS-CoV-2 and reducing stress on health care.
If the EU/EEA health system fails, other patients who need intensive care in a few days or weeks to come will likely be affected.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by Coronavirus 2 acute drug syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has recently killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tingkok and other parts of the world, causing human harm.
Mirip with its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from orbit and cause similar noise through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has a lower rate of pregnancy and mortality compared to SARS, but it's more common and more about adolescents than men, and more about men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this new disease, this article is trying to provide accurate time and understanding of the rapidly growing subject of research.
We'll discuss the basis of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions remain that way, we hope that this article will help us to understand and deal with them as well as to understand and deal with them.
The Semim Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Tinghoa people who are ordered to stay at home for vacation and a few weeks after it because of the new virus epidemic.
This virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the acute drug syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it is called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its disease is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, Tingkok, and soon spread throughout the country and in nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Until 2 March 2020, this virus has affected 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases, with more than 40,000 patients scattered and 3,000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "number number gap" and potential damage more strongly than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nix.gov/pubmed/), within less than two months of the first report on 7 January 2020, which established a sequence of virus isolated from some patients, more than 200 were then published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This survey is trying to capture the growth of research in new areas that are rapidly growing.
Maybe we're going to try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, which is the mid-term end syndrome (MERS, published in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the dangers and disease forecasts and some other questions that have not yet been answered.
Based on tradition, CoV is considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, especially because of about 15% of the 4 pills.
However, in this century, we have found a highly pathogenic coV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing the initial release in Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
That's why, COVID-19 is now the third version of CoV in human history recorded.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the pneumonia class was originally unknown for the first time reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Hospital Commission of the Republic of Tiongkok.
Seven days later, CoV sequence was destroyed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
During that time, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20th, health-care-care infection was reported, indicating that human-human transmission could happen.
On January 23, a circuit assembly was held in the city of Wuhan and the entire assembly was closed.
On January 24th, the first clinical study on this disease reported that only 21 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan marine food market, considered to be the first place of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO announced this report as a global health crisis.
In time, this disease has spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As the situation grew very rapidly, the end result and the spread of corruption still needs to be fixed.
On February 11, 2020, multi-centred study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 COVID-19 patients, was confirmed, showed a more detailed epidemi picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of people under 50 years of age, only a few under 20 years of age, and only 14 people under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/1000) compared women (0.27/1000).
COVID-19 grew in the cluster, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 consumes 5-rates (2-9) days from adjection to diagnosis.
The rate incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The time of the rate from the east to the west is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Base reproduction (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
Hundreds of people infected have increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, according to the time of mass transportation prior to the Semim Museum Festival in Tiongkok.
Mortality of patients with confirmed cases is 144% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and fatalities are expected for all major patients 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are the type of pelvic (pria), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of a major virus gathering that contains a sense RNA subfamily.
CoV can be divided into four genes, alpha, beta, gamma, and deltas, with alpha- and beta-coV known for human infection.
Glycoprotein tonola or spike (S) combined with cell receptors, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) enzymes and peptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the membrane fuss occur.
The RNA virus is released into sitoplasma; after replication through the virus, RNA genetically dispersed the total glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein form vesicular virion vesicles, which then experienced fusion with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The economic sequence SARS-CoV-2 was first reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV type with genetic equality more than 99.98% of the 10 samples that were sequenced; the sample was taken from the original site, namely the Huan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MercS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscopic, the SARS-CoV-2 particle is found in a very typical part of the epithelium of the human soul.
ACE2 humans found are receptors for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S SARS-CoV-2 protein in combination with ACE2 in humans is weaker than in relation to S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a non-equivalent infection of SARS-CoV infection in the patient.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein that is attached to orf3b and protein that is mixed with the Orf8 string.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit IFNB expression; however, orf8 does not have a known functional or motif domain.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM ACE2 complete human structure on resolution 2.9 Å in a complex with a amino-ano B0AT1 transporter.
They found that a complex, which has open and closed transformations, is designed to form a diameter and a complex ACE2-B0AT1 can build two proteins S, which are evidence of contamination and CV infection.
B0AT1 can be performed in a therapeutic setting to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother's home and between
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known from the environment and each is transmitted to humans through the clouds and clouds.
Through a philosophical comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the virus is considered to be the original parent of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two coVs of the virus called SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZ21.
However, the link between the transmission route and the transmission route has yet to be explained.
Ji, et al. advised the Ular to take the virus out of the herd to the people involved in homolog recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, suggest that intergling, mamalia reduces the length of breast feeding that is commonly used in traditional Tionghoa medicine, has potential as a parent among SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in CoV found in the environment and SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% of the widespread differences throughout the gene remain a major difference; therefore, the final results have not yet been achieved as concrete evidence (Gr. 3).
The physicotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2 is not known in most cases.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a strong environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% drop.
SARS-CoV-2 might have the same quality.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat radiation at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, infections containing chlorine, peroxide salt, chloroform, and other fatty acids, but not chlorohexidine, the effect of activating virus.
In general, the entire population of humans do not have immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and that is due to this new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
As a result, we can only refer to other coV studies before, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gr. 4).
In general, after invasive breast, the virus is identified by the immune system through a pelvic receptor (PRR), which includes C-type ectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of the inflamator factor, the measurement of the dendrite cell, and the synthesis of interferon type I (IFN) that limits the preaching of the virus and speeds up the fagositois antigen virus by macrophag.
However, protein N on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune reactions.
Soon afterward, the adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
Limphositis T, which includes CD4+ cells and CD8+, plays an important role in this battle.
The T CD4+ cell stimulates B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and the T CD8+ cells kill the virus directly.
The T cells help produce proinflammator sites to help protect the cells.
Nevertheless, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by injecting apoptosis T cells.
Moral immunity, which includes complications, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibiotics, is also important in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibiotics that are isolated from patients who have improved control of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune reactions have resulted in a large number of radically free locals, which can cause damage to the lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, failure of the immune system and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is prescribed by the avitant classer, is more about breast-feeding with sexually transmitted diseases and pregnant women.
In general, people who are infected with a large number of viruses or who are infected with immunodeficiency may have a higher risk of infection than others.
The estimate of the SARS-CoV-2 rate incubation period is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on the study of 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the rate incubation period was 3 days and increased from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as explained above, shows that the incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days is based on demographic 8.866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period to prevent infection, but without delay, transmit the virus to others.
As a general rule, people who are infected with a virus or infection are usually forced to undergo surgery for 14 days.
Do you have to keep your quarantine schedule up to 24 days?
Depression is often the COVID-19 main and early cycle, with or without the addition of other gears such as a bowel stone, apetration, bone pain, analgia, headache, headache, rinorea, skin pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxia one week after the diagnosis.
In severe cases, the progression of the patient’s disease is rapidly becoming acute, septic, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients suffering from dementia and/or acute constipation and dementia should be treated with the virus for diagnosis, even if there is no renal impairment.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that a high incidence of 98% to dengue, 76% to solid rock, 55% to dyspnea, and 3% to diet; 8% patients needed ventilator support.
The same finding has been reported in these two recent studies, namely the study of family and class classes caused by the transmission of asymptomatic people.
Similarly, the 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced dementia (98%), short stones (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as a major cause.
However, 80% of patients need ventilating support, far more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the MERS tolerance higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and gastrointestinal disease (21%) have also been observed in the MERS.
In SARS patients, dementia (99%-100%), kidney stones (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and gastrointestinal disease (13-25%) have been shown to be the main cause and ventilation support is needed for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
Until 14 February, COVID-19 mortality is 2% high with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, the mortality of SARS in November 2002 was 10 percent of 8,096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, 37% of the 2,494 cases were confirmed.
A previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached a level of 6.47 with confidence interval (CI) 95% high 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only exceeded 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MercS-CoV and SARS-CoV in pregnancy, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher broadcasting capacity compared with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not just the METS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is greater than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Audrey is often found in one family or in a group or in a car, such as a fishing boat.
Patients often have a travel trip or live in Wuhan or another affected area or have contact with infected people or patients for the last two weeks before they leave.
However, it has been reported that a person can carry a virus without showing more than two weeks of pregnancy and that patients who are expelled from the hospital can carry another virus.
In early stages, patients had white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) normal or low.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte counts < 1×109/L, and aspartate aminotransferase aspartate and increased virality found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Heart enzymes and bone marrow and myoglobin increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and bloodless air increase in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer increased, i.e. fibrin production in the blood, and lymphocyte levels progressively decline.
Toraks photo exchanges were found on the large COVID-19 patient's size and were replaced by bilateral light bulbs or ground-glass opiates in the lungs.
Patients often experience acute pneumonia, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When AARDS occurs, tatter control inflammation, the accumulation of air, and progressive fibrosis greatly increase the volume of gas flow.
The function of Type I pneumositis and Type II lowers the surface level and increases the pressure of the surface to lower the dust capacity to increase and increase the risk of dust collapse.
As a result, the worst meeting on the photos of Toraks is often parallel to the worst of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID-19 analysis of pathology showed a dissociation of pneumotitis, haemorrhage, and interstitial lymphosis infiltration, as well as sensorial cells, many of the patients who died from this disease, according to the pathology of virus infection and ARDS as well as the analysis of pathology of patients SARS and MERS.
RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection through the reverse polymerase transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the level of false negative levels, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) in Tiongkok on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations also occur in SARS diagnosis.
As a result, the combination of disease epidemics, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is very important and has an impact on effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the SHERLOCK-based CRISPR technical use protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which detects the RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetic fragment at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 microliter input) using cell tapes in less than one hour without having to use a limited instrument.
However, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and flexibility if verification is performed on a clinical sample.
Because of a lack of experience with new CoV, doctors in particular provide support to patients with COVID-19, always try various treatments that have been used or previously prescribed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other official diseases (Table 2.2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential antiviral therapy, immunosuppression, steroids, plasma from patients who have recovered, traditional Tionghoa medicines, and psychological support.
Even plasma from newly recovered patients is recommended for use in therapy.
The pharmaceutical industry has developed antibiotics and vaccines against this virus.
At the initial stage, SARS-CoV-2 particularly attacks dust and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and gynaline systems.
However, the functions and weaknesses of the immune system are a major threat to the patient’s health and cause of death.
As a result, drug support is very important to alleviate hunger and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high-risk oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive ventilation, depending on the level of disease risk.
Patients with severe constipation should be supported with extracurpororporeum (ECMO) oxygenation, the thermo-modified cardiopulmoner paint technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening radiation.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytes, prevention and treatment of secondary and septic infections, as well as the protection of vital organ function are also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The more known immune system reactions cause sytokinosis in patients with SARS and MERS.
Badai sitoquin is a system-wide inflamatrant response that is defined by the release of sitokin, which includes TNfa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNB, IFNG, and MCP-1.
These sytokins induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that become the main cause of ARDS and fail to detect the immune system.
Immunosuppression is very important in the development of cytokines, especially in poor patients.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibiotic, has been used to treat sitoquine.
Other immunosuppressive targets for sytokin tests include modulation of immune response to T cells; IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF prolongation; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; sytokin signalization 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroid, as immunosuppressant, is widely used in the SARS treatment to reduce inflammation.
However, the high dose steroids do not benefit from severe renal impairment in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, steroids can cause serious side effects, especially osteonecosis, which can cause very high prognosis.
However, short-term administration of corticosteroids at a lower dose is still encouraged to give careful attention to patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, the provision of resizvir intravenously, i.e. a nucleotide analog, was found specifically to be a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg.
In time, resizvir also showed inhibition of RNA virus alone, which includes MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead prepared this fuel for Tiongkok to do a sample sample on the SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the result was very anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute endpoints.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, heart attack, and other side effects may occur after co-administration with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This treatment interaction with other medicines that patients use should be co-administered.
Plasma from patients who have recovered and who have an antibodies
A long history of blood clotting from the liver to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent the disease from developing.
True, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodi is immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules on pathogens, and control them directly.
Based on this, plasma is collected from a group of patients who have already recovered from COVID-19 and are isolated from 10 patients with severe diseases.
Their body weight improved within 24 hours, including the spread of inflammation and viral load, and increased oxygen content in the blood.
However, verification and clarification must be made in order to develop this method for the use of large scale prior to the development of specific therapy.
Further, in addition to the therapeutic effect, some plasma deficiency needs to be considered together.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the immune response in excess of time and cause a sytokinic syndrome, which is a potentially life - threatening toxicity.
Antibodies in blood are usually low and plasma is needed in a large number of patients with a critical illness.
The development and production of specific antibiotics quickly enough to fight global epidemics are difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate cells B from patients who have recovered and to identify genetic codes that are effective antibiotics or to make effective antibodies resistant to important proteins for the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the level of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiongkok for thousands of years.
However, most of the effect depends on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula varies depending on the diagnosis of disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the active components are yet to be known or not clear because it is difficult to extract or verify that component or optimal combination.
Now, as effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 has not yet been available, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate to moderate to severe disease or for those who are cleansed of serious illness.
For example, Caps. Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were successfully treated for COVID-19.
The therapeutic clearance rate in the COVID-19 patient therapy was observed in some TIongkok provinces using TCM in 87% of its patients, including Gansu (6.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, which used TCM only about 30% of the COVID-19 patients, had a lower clearance rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very serious because many other visible factors, such as the number and severity of patients, need to be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends introduced a study comparing Western Medicines (WM) only with WM and TCM related therapy.
They found that the time needed for body heat recovery, loss of heat, and the amount of air is much shorter in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
Worse yet, the magnitude of noise pollution (from weight to weight) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group only (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and mortality lower than the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group only (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still await better testing on a larger scale and in more research centres.
The other thing that's interesting is to deny the mechanism of work and define the effective components in the TCM therapy or combination, if possible.
Most patients expected to or confirmed COVID-19 feel very afraid of the disease that is spreading and even killing it, and those with it also feel free, lonely, and angry.
Further, such infections as dementia, hypoxia, and skeletal pain and other side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause increased mental confusion and stress.
In the early phase of SARS, a range of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, depression, panic attacks, psychomotor shocks, psychotic shocks, delirium, and even suicides have been reported.
The responsible communication of contact and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 media, can make people more relaxed and feel guilty about the effects of addiction, carantine, and stygma on friends and friends.
For that reason, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, those expected, and those who interact with them, as well as the general public needed.
Psychological support should include multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with routine and accurate comparisons about SARS-CoV-2, therapy plans and the use of professional devices and electronic applications to avoid contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important to establish transmission lines from the animal reserve and humans infected with rare and often characterized by antiviral therapy in control of the epidemic caused by virus infection.
Upaya has been made to develop a protein-based vaccine S, which has long and effectively produced control and/or immune antibodies that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, life-threatening vaccines have been evaluated on test animals.
However, the effectiveness of this vaccine candidate in vivo on the development and model of fatal resistance and protection against zoonotic virus infection should be determined before clinical studies are started.
This may be because SARS passed 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
Instead, the sporadic and MERS cluster cases continue to take place in the Middle East and spread to other areas because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic region.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS by using an activated virus, DNA plasma, virus vector, nanopartikel, particles similar to the virus, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in the test animals.
The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that are safe and effective for non-immunians is a very urgent and important task to control the current epidemic.
However, this problem is not easy to solve because it takes a long time to develop a vaccine (at least 18 months) and a dynamic CV variation.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show the full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient will be able to recover completely.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
As a result, the achievement of the disease forecasting is very important for the health care team to give priority to its services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can be affected or related to the patient's COVID-19 forecast (Table 3):
Usia: Usia is the most important factor for SARS forecasting, which also happens for COVID-19.
The COVID-19 primarily occurred at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in the study of 8.866 cases as described above.
Patients who require intensive care of the tendon have comorbidity and complications as well as significantly older than patients who do not need intensive treatment (meaning 66 years of age compared to 51 years of age), who prescribe age as a prognostic factor for the end of the COVID-19 patient.
Type of protection: SARS-CoV-2 more infected men compared to women (0.31/100, compared to 0.27/100), as explained above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
A heart attack is also a major cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to be associated with coagulation with ACE2-positive, which can affect heart function in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and illness are very corrosive and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood represents the spread of inflammation or network damage and is recommended as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between the CRP level and the prevalence of COVID-19 has also been recommended.
In addition, increased dehydrogenase (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alanine (ALT), and kinase (CK) may also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and are released during network damage.
Because of that, these enzymes are traditional agents for heart and heart functioning.
Primary clinical care: Toraks photo and temporary clinical pregnancy development should be considered together with other things to predict the final results and the COVID-19 complications.
Use of steroids: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppression that is widely used as long-term therapy for infectious diseases to reduce inflammation.
Because high doses of corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors of this disease eventually suffer from vascular osteonecrosis with the ability to live a lifetime and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a lower dose and temporarily administered to the COVID-19 patient.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 release, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to cross the long-term and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychology and long-term support should be provided to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on this long-term demographic study, COVID-19 seems to have an epidemiological picture different from SARS.
In addition to applications in the lower arms range, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively apply on the upper arms ranges and cause mild or non-smokers in the early phase of infection, like other coVs that cause pills.
Therefore, at the initial stage or time of incubation, infected patients can produce a large number of viruses during day-to-day activities, which pose a major problem in controlling the epidemic.
However, the SARS-CoV transmission is believed to have occurred when a terminally ill patient and most do not occur at the initial stage.
Thus, COVID-19 is now much worse and more difficult to control than SARS.
At present, great efforts are being made in Tiongkok, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan region and the surrounding cities and the quarantine of almost all populations with the hope of completing the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this has greatly affected the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients has declined, which indicates the spread of epidemics.
The most optimistic estimate of the release will end in March and the breeding phase will last for 3-4 months.
Some experts, however, do not agree.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be far more widespread than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., made a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and said that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
The Canadian study group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-cocks and infested patients who had recovered and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier. This indicates that the virus that was identified back could be a recurrence of episodes, similar to influenza.
However, the signs promised to happen in Tiongkok, if seen on the basis of a new number of cases, which showed that the strategy could now be successful.
Once again, Ebola will cause one million cases of death.
However, with severe quarantine and isolation, this disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 reduced its ability to infection and eventually disappear or become a virus that is not too pathogenic to humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit through stones or sand, and possibly through direct contact with substances contaminated by the virus.
This virus is also found in the feses so that it detects the possibility of new transmissions, i.e. the feses-ke-mututs transmission.
This recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nocomial infections, which include 17 patients with other diseases prior to and 40 healthcare providers.
As a result, the combined prevention measures must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those affected by illness or infection.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, good masks and N95 respiratory masks (the number of the 1860s) to help control the spread of viruses.
The mask is designed to keep people who are potentially infected with the disease themselves from getting airborne or attaching material to the surface, where they can be kept to others.
However, only the N95 mask (the 1860 series number) that can protect against viral inhalation with a minimum size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virus can be fully medetic; SARS-CoV-2 is equal to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Since the particles can be medicated even five weight masks that have been shot into one, health care providers that are directly in contact with patients should wear N95 (the number of the 1860 series) rather than the weight mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolates to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also affect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing N95 masks; the virus may enter his body through eye contact.
As a result, health - care providers should also wear the facial features of the eye or the eyes as they work with patients.
For the public in the affected areas or in the affected areas, it is highly recommended for each person to wash his hands with soap that is more often contaminated than usual, try to stay at home using quarantine, and avoid contact with those who are infected.
Three feet [2.8.9.9 m] long were used to protect the patient’s distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high horology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must be a major warning for Tiongkok that has a strong memory of the 2003 SARS release.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre congratulated the population by saying that this new virus has a low quality of preaching and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and the prevention and protection of this disease is not a problem.
This message is a great relief to the community, especially when the entire country is preparing for the Semmi Museum Festival, so that this critical time is passed to cover the yet small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease control team in Tingkok should learn from this and make a big improvement in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because each word is observed and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to clinical information than to wait for official reports from a doctor or a competent authority; (3) more limit the use of epidemic potential at an early stage, rather than attempting to satisfy the public; and (4) more often to produce targeted and effective public training on disease epidemics and to improve the social response system periodically.
The COVID-19 version is caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to explode at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the public has been preaching throughout Tingkok and more than 50 countries around the world during this visit.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 virus has returned as the SARS virus has returned.
However, there are a few obvious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which is very important to protect and treat patients.
COVID-19 more about pregnancy than young people and more about men than women, and the rate of death is also higher than that of young people.
Mortality SARS is higher than mortality COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
The COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are not pregnant, while the SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are ill. This makes a greater challenge in preventing COVID-19 from preaching compared with the SARS.
This explains some of the reasons for SARS-CoV-2 to spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
The routine RNA function to check SARS-CoV-2 can produce negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can still benefit from the virus tests.
This discovery greatly increases the risk of virus spread.
With the rapid progress of the COVID-19 research, some important issues still need to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a major genetic homology is found 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two coV-like-SARS, we still can't conclude that SARS-COV-2 is from the qualifier.
What animals are different species in order to manipulate the virus from its source, tell people about the plague, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the numbers 1 and 2, we would not be able to solve the problem effectively and we would not be able to repeat it at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemistry suggest that SARS-CoV-2 combines with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the liver cells and affect subsequent pathology changes?
Is this virus also associated with a cell that expresses an ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we can't achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will this plague become a global pandemic, end up like SARS, or resurfaced periodically like flu?
The answer to the above questions and many other statements is vital, but it may take time to find them.
Nevertheless, no matter how precious the occasion may be, we do not have any choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible so that we can return to normal life.
The zoonotic origin of the human crown virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have caused co-evolution of the corona virus (CoV) and its mother, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coVs (HCoVs) were known to cause infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis.
The acute endpoint syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East (MERS) syndrome reverses the situation and reveals how much HCoV infection can damage and endanger the soul.
The SARS-CoV-2 municipality in Tiongkok centre in the end of 2019 has made CoV a question back and surprise us with a high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonoses, which is why the original understanding of the zoonotic HCoV will benefit us.
Most of the HCoV comes from the wild, and in this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
Inang among some HCoV reserves have also been known.
Identification of the mother of animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human disease.
Animal coV interaction studies can also provide important insight into the pathogenicity of coV in humans.
In this survey, we present a general picture of the current knowledge of seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of its findings and its zoonotic origins and the transmission of its inter-species.
Most importantly, we compared and contrasted HCoV with the theory of evolution and recombination of genome.
The epidemic of CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, genetic conditions that have been successful and that involve the evolution of viruses in the spread of disease are also regulated.
Corona virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which is composed of a group of RNA viruses that combine with positive changes, and end up single.
This virus has the largest gene of 26 to 32 kilograms between RNA virus called "CoV", because its morphology is similar to that of the brain under the electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has a non-se segmentation gene that has a similar meaning.
About two thirds of the genome is composed of two large open reading lines (ORF1a and ORF1b) that form part of each other. Both are translated into polyprotein replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein has experienced further depletion to form 16 non-structured proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the gene is made up of the open reading line (ORF) for structural protein, which includes ion or spike (S), cleavage or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of protein supplements that are specific to the birth limit are also identified by the range of births of the coV.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified as four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genes, beta-CoV has the largest HCOV gene and is divided into four consecutive lines (A, B, C, and D).
Evidence of phylogenetic evidence shows that cartilage and fertilization animals are sources of a large portion alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while eggs are primary reserves of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to pass species extinctions and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
So far, there are seven human coVs (HCoV) known.
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs have been infected with HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV-Cone syndrome acute perday (SARS-CoV), East Tengah syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 are usually due to mild dryness, such as pill and/or diet.
Rather, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, resulting in a relatively high incidence of respiratory infections in more patients and have a higher chance of developing acute respiratory arrest syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from a patient's intestines in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been collected through deep study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which are the result of self-recovery.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that the general HCoV infection is not dangerous, until the SARS virus occurs.
The SARS reported in 2003 is one of the most devastating attacks in history, affecting more than 8,000 people with violent deaths of about 10%.
Ten years later, the mid - Middle Eastern Syndrome (MERS) caused the epidemic to continue in the Arabian Peninsula with the preaching work in various parts of the world.
HCoV new 2019 (2019-nCoV), hereinafter referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is a causative epidemic agent of the 2019 coronary virus (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people by 3 March 2020.
The alarm has closed and the world has to prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins from the earth’s crust, ticks, or food animals.
Many evidence supports the origin of all the HCoVs of the universe. In the past, coV has been well adapted to nonpathogenic properties, but has shown great genetic makeup.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created medical, science, social, and moral challenges for Tionkok and the world.
HCoV zoonotic biologists have given the task of understanding the natural processes, the movement of the movement, and the elimination factors resulting from the movement of species.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search for reserve animals, inter alia, and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which have important implications in preventing the preaching of the coming time.
In this survey, we presented a general picture of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmissions, and HCoV pathogens.
We specifically discussed and discussed the general topic that HCoV induction virus is usually non-pathogenic in its natural reserve, but became pathogenic after transmissing species to new mothers.
We're also investigating the HCoV evolution train that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by pathogenicity generation.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the insulation of HCoV-229E strain B814, the first of the patients with diabetes, various coVs have been isolated from various infected animals, which include rats, cats, dogs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few years, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The brief history of HCoV findings in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
Strain HCoV-229E was first isolated from the respiratory system that experienced respiratory infection in 1966, which was then scheduled to be cured on the WI-38 oral line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have a brain tumor, which includes headaches, nausea, vomiting, and constipation, including toothaches and stones seen in 10 ~20% of cases.
Next, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and a series of lines in the still falling brain.
The clinical description of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which can not automatically be compared to other infectious pathogens such as influenza A and rhinivus virus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and the most widely transmitted in the cold season in the drying area.
Usually, incubation of these two viruses is less than one week and is followed by a period of illness for about 2 weeks.
Based on a voluntary study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E have experienced a mild stroke.
Only a small number of patients with a weakened body system showing a severe respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as "pneumonia atypical", is the first HCoV impact pandemic well documented in human history and its etiology agency is SARS-CoV, which is the third found HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
The SARS epidemic affected 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, which were reported in many countries and countries.
Disappeared from the super driver, each case is expected to cause about two seconds, with a period of incubation of 4 to 7 days and a peak of the virus is seen on the 10th day of disease.
Patients with SARS-CoV infection first experience mialgia, headaches, fever, and nausea, followed by dyspnea, stones, and respiratory disturbances as a result of further elevations.
Limphopenia, abnormal heart function tests, and increased bone creations are a complex laboratory in the SARS.
The effects of alveolar infusion, epithelial proliferation, and macrophag growth are also alarmed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal, heart, and kidney disorders can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by sitocin waves, which can cause death, especially in patients who are weak.
The virus was first isolated from the oral biopsy opened up by a noll patient traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, much has been done for HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from 7 months old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus initially became very contagious to infants, infants, and the most vulnerable patients who suffer from infectious diseases.
The image of corrosion, conjunctivitis, dementia, and bronchialitis is found in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explained the isolation of the same virus from the sperm gene of men aged 8 months suffering pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, this virus has been widely spread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 47% of the general infectious disease and its peaks occur at the beginning of the heat, cold, and cold season.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the obstructive lariitis, also called crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from 71-year-old men who had been cared for by pneumonia and bronchiolithism in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, resulting in mild respiratory disease.
These four HCOV communities have all adapted to humans and generally have small potential to become very pathogens. However, exceptional cases have occurred because of unknown reasons, such as in the new subtype HCOV-NL63 subtype cases, which have been reported due to severe respiratory infections in Tingkok.
In general, when it comes to the ability to move efficiently and to maintain self - control in humans, this HCoV virus and pathogenicity is also lacking.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from poor 60-year-old patients who experienced acute pneumonia and failed to heal in Saudi Arabia.
Although the majority of cases have been confirmed by the laboratory from the Middle East, the cases have been reported with a number of second - rate witnessing campaigns in several European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary event took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical phenomenon is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which is characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also have acute renal failure, which is far more likely to occur only in MERS among HCoV-related diseases.
More than 30% of patients showed gastrointestinal fever, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 cases were confirmed by the high deaths of the laboratory, that is, 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most terrible viruses known to humans.
By mid-December 2019, a retrospective pneumonic classer was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the spread of low respiratory infections that are occurring and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Authority and called for the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a death rate of 3.4%.
It needs to be stated, deaths in Hubei, Tiongkok, high 4.2%, while deaths outside Hubei are 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious weapon infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with images of smoke, stones, and breath.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory tract syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of high nucleotide horology, a high 82%, both grouped into different phylogenetic trees.
The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but it's more likely to be compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects have been reported and may play a role in the fast-paced SARS-CoV-2 preaching around the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoV shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the period of incubation and the duration of the HCoV disease is very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows six other HCoV general trains.
Second, COVID-19 is located between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (aka HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more general picture of the Community HCoV infection, which includes non-specific cold or even non-smoker images.
On the other hand, a small portion of the COVID-19 cases that are poor can be seen as SARS-CoV infection despite a slightly lower race.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pool characteristics, which are similar to the common HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCoV community.
On the other hand, there is no ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 after some roads in humans still need to be reversified, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, like the other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from feses sample.
"The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was an important factor, such as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in a certain situation, that must still be defined by the next study."
What's also important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is as regular as in the HCoV community case.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 image, which includes the ability to transmit, pathogenicity, and to communicate progress in a number of human pathways, will have a great impact on the final generation of the ongoing COVID-19 release.
The four HCoV communities that caused the drought were all adapted to humans.
From other points of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be the species of anti-HCoV pandemics of the time of the test.
HCoV, which causes severe HCV diseases and people who suffer from HCV, has been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCoV should be applied in humans in a number of ways to allow for the accumulation of the adaptive mutations used against the anti-cancer factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 release continues and the more people are infected, the greater the risk of this virus being fully adapted to humans.
If the virus is properly adapted, human transmission will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control.
Over the years, four CoV communities have been scattered in the human population and have been embroiled in immunocompetitive peoples.
This virus doesn't need a reserve of animals.
On the contrary, very pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been adapted to humans and its transmission in humans cannot be preserved.
Both must protect themselves and make repairs in zoonotic reserves and seek opportunities to spread to the rare human target, possibly through one or more interdependency and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit like HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than the community HCoV and not the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It's important to consider whether SARS-CoV-2 will fit fully with humans and circulatory in humans without reserve animals or between.
Before we talk about the HCoV animal habitat, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary mothers, nature, reserve, interdependency, and the amplification of HCoV.
The animal acts as the mother of the evolutionist HCoV if it has a nearby peak and shares high horology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The mountain virus usually adapts well to its nonpathogenic properties.
Likewise, the mother of a reserve carried HCoV gradually and in the past century.
In both cases, breast infection is normal and is normal breast for HCoV or induction virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is newly entered into the breast right before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus is still not adaptable to the new breast and often is pathogenic.
The interstellar can function as a source of zoonotic human infection and play as an amplifier parent by allowing the virus to be temporarily applied, and then transmit it to humans to amplify the human infection scale.
HCoV can be infected with a tumor if it cannot keep its transmission in the middle.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to the interrelationship of the parent and even cause long - term emancipation.
In this regard, the bride is the mother of a natural reserve.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that the SARS zero case has a link to the heart animals.
A further study of seroprevalence shows that the animal sales of these animals have higher IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevalence compared to the general population.
The monthly (Larvata Pasteum) and the dog's companion on the live animal market is the first identified to carry the similar SARS-CoV virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Suddenly, this is supported by the fact that no further SARS cases have been reported since all disputes on the market have been killed.
Thus, it is reported that the release of the month from the wild or farm that is not exposed to the animal market is largely a negative test for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the freezing of the month may only act as a separate amplifier, but not a natural resource of SARS-CoV.
It needs to be stated, since 80% of all animals on the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be estimated that many small mammals may also function as the mother of amplifiers between SARS-CoV.
All this mother looks like her mother's end of SARS-CoV.
The search for wild animals for SARS-CoV continues to reveal the close-to-war CoV, known as the Rhinolopus of SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is located on the Tiongkok vessel.
This approach results in a positive test for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and sequences through SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This coV and the other coV surgeons share nymology of the 88-92% nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV.
This study is a foundation for a new concept that the universe is the beauty of the new human pathogens.
Some coVs are similar to SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified from the environment, but only one, called WIV1, can be diagnosed as a live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 from the summer feces sample is shown to be using ACE2 onions, juices, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, a convalescent SARS patient can control WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the closest mountain to SARS-CoV in the desert, with a high-95% nucleologic sequence of nucleotide.
Given its high horology among these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not directly induction virus SARS-CoV and that the surgeon is not in the immediate reserve of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis combines MERS-CoV into the same group as the CV-HKU4 and the CV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 rosary and MERS-CoV use the same yellow receptor, i.e. peptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4), as a path to enter the virus.
RNA polymerase sequences based on RNA MARS-CoV in a phylogenetic way are closer to its presence in the trans-CoV beta-cove identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, there's no MercS-CoV alive in the desert.
MercS-CoV and the nearest coV-HKU25 relatives only share 87% of the nucleotide sequence.
As a result, passengers may not be able to afford an immediate MERS-CoV reserve.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East shows that the Arab branch produces a sero-positive result for specific antibiotics that control MERS-CoV, just like the Middle East branch in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans are isolated from the Arab National Park. This further indicates that the bridge is a real reserve for the MercS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral eruptions with a common cold usually slow down on the test nodes infected with MERS-CoV.
The need to be identified is that the virus-infective nodes reduce the virus not only through the deadly route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of the virus flow from the orbit.
However, the question has not yet been answered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have contact with rats prior to pregnancy, possibly the consequences of human-human transmission or transmission routes that involve unknown animals' species carrying METS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 divides 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV ratG13 that is isolated from Rhinolophus afinis.
As in the SARS-CoV case and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to establish induction relationships.
In other words, it may not be a direct backup of SARS-CoV-2, except if the almost identical coV was found later.
Probably, the mother of animals between SARS-CoV-2 is among the wild species sold and killed in the Great Sea Food Market. Many cases of the early COVID-19 relate to this market, which indicates the possibility of transmissible human beings.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences show that a group of endangered small mammals, known as trangling (Manis javanica), may also carry beta-CoV mountains that are in conflict with SARS-CoV-2.
This new coV radiation gene divides 85-92% nymology by nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the coV is closely related to the RATG13 with a 90 - percent high level of nucleotide sequence.
Both are grouped into two sub-groups of virus-like SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of the areas of receptor binding (RBD) compared to SARS-CoV-2, with a sequence of a major amino acid 97.4%.
Unfortunately, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are far different, even though the level of secondary horology is all through higher.
A previous study in the infected radiation also reported detecting viral contagion from the porous sample, which was also associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study doubling different methods of sampling and manual curves to produce sequences of partial gene based on approximately 86.3% of complete virus.
We can't ignore the possibility of crashing as one of the most beautiful animals between SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is still no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 directly from the interference due to the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 link.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionist paths in the circuits, the tranglings, and other mammals still need to be set.
Although the highest secondary homology on RBD is found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 triangling, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest homology on the entire secondary level.
It is too speculative when it is said that the height of the similarity between RBD beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 trangling and SARS-CoV-2 is caused by the convergence evolution of its selectivity on the media.
Hypothesis supports recombination between beta-CoV-sarabat-SARS-CoV-2 triangling and RatG13 in third species.
As a factor in the evolution movement, many recombinations occur between beta-CoV.
Researchers have not yet been able to decide on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to very pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been designated.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from coV inhalation, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 induction animals have been found.
It is reported that CoV is known as ARCoV.2 (Applachian Ridge CoV) which is detected in three North American colors shows close proximity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E genetically competed with other coV giants, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also claimed to be the bridge between them.
To make it more clear, current knowledge of the origin of HCoV animals is included in Figures 1 and Table 2.
A phylogenetic analysis has shown that HCoV has been transmitted between species in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 prescribed species of domestic animals for human infection, it was reported that there was an outbreak of deadly infection.
History of the transmission of HCoV-229E between species is not very clear.
Alpha-CoV transactors with HCoV-229E have been found.
Between them, there's alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from the virus to humans.
First of all, humans, not alpine, may have to contend with the complexity of the ecological cycle together.
On the contrary, humans have limited contact with alpine.
Second, alpha-CoV-coV-combinant with HCoV-229E has a variety of types and non-pathogenics in the liver, while alpha-CoV alpaca causes infectious diseases in the infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca was not found in feral animals.
As a result, the possibility of getting alpha-CoV from HCoV-229E from humans cannot be supported.
In fact, malaria is a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
As a result, it is not too encouraging that the virus may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is that while alpha-CoV is active as an HCoV-229E gene prolongant, alpacas and Arabic salts may function as an interdependency that transmits virus to humans, exactly like the MercS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a very good example of the transmission of inter-species from the desert to the Arabian and from the Arabian to the human.
The origin of the MERS-CoV evolutionist from the universe is known for the initial identification of the virus and also strengthened by subsequent encounters.
Clearly, the virus is a host of rich virus species for genetic fragmentation between species and transmissibility between species.
A long age, a close colony, a warm social interaction, and a strong flight capacity, all are a condition that supports the environment to be an ideal 'enlightened virus'.
On the other hand, the MercS-CoV has been entering the Arab coast for decades.
This virus has been adapted to a bridge that has changed from the ring to a stable and natural reserve ring.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintain relatively low mutagenic air in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens suddenly and man remains the last parent of the MercS-CoV because its transmission cannot continue.
Not like the ring part in the MercS-CoV transmission, the brake part, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In particular, beta-CoV radiation is highly pathogenic in radiation.
Interglinging may be the last ring for the SARS-CoV-2, as well as the softness in the SARS-CoV case.
In the coming studies, some possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 end species from animals to humans should be considered or supported.
First of all, it can be a reserve ring for SARS-CoV-2, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans are capable of sharing the earth’s many ecological cycles by means of a flood or a hailstorm.
Second, radiation could be one of the intermittent amplifiers for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The human body is made up of many parts of the human body, including its body and mind.
Probably, many mammals, including pets, race against SARS-CoV-2.
The antibodies against food and wild animals were to be performed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in three species that are well-versed with both vertebrates and vertebrates.
The original search for SARS-CoV-2 animals is still ongoing.
Having been removed from various species of animals, three main factors on the side of the virus are also important to facilitate coV through species extinction.
First, the relatively high mutatis mutandis in the RNA replication.
Compared to another RNA virus, the COV mutatis mutandis can be considered to be "standing" to "high" with a high rate replacement of ~10-4 per year, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to the new mother.
CoV has exoribonules of clearance, conclusions that affect very high mutagenicity, atenuasity, or even invisibility.
Interestingly, a nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress the replication of CoV by inhibiting exorubinculase and RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the coV mutatis mutandis are about a million times higher than the mother’s.
In addition, mutatis mutandis are often high when coV is not compatible with the mother.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutatis mutandis, the SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, setting higher adaptive levels than humans.
Maybe the SARS-CoV-2 has been adapted to other ancestors who are close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also true of the MercS-CoV that has been adapted to the Arab bridge.
In theory, little chance that genetic contamination will quickly make vaccines and antiviral agents of SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA gene in the CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, so that it increases the probability of inter-species co-evolution, which is useful for creating new coV when appropriate.
This is supported by a number of unique open readings and protein functions that are felt at the end of the 3′ genome.
Thirdly, CoV kerap replaces the model by the end of the RNA replication through the unique "choice-salin" mechanism.
In the ring that works as a contestant, the gravitational pull took place during the RNA CoV transcription.
A full and subgenomic RNA that is highly homologous can experience recombination to form a new coV.
Natural reproductive phylogenetic evidence has been found on HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as on CoV animals such as L-CoV and CoV-HKU9.
Hepatic virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the tooth receptor is another major factor that affects the transmission of interspecies.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is considered a special example, which also shows positive selections during inter-species transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between SARS-CoV human isolates and amputation, SARS-CoV is expected to experience rapid adaptations in various mice, especially by mutatis mutandis on RBD protein S.
In general, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and is intensively targeted as an antibodies response target.
At SARS-CoV, RBD is a 318 to 510 amino acid on the S1 fragment, which connects with ACE2 humans and its recreceptor as a path to the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the receptor ACE2 of various animals, which includes rats, mice, ticks, and dogs of prey, thus enabling the transmission of viruses between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid esters that are observed different from human virus isolates and satin at RBD and 4 of which are located in the receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV facilitates K479N and S487T mutatis mutandis in its RBD, which may increase protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acids may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It is necessary to state that SARS-CoV-2 has a cell receptor equal to SARS-CoV.
A significant 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit involves protein binding ACE2 to humans likely has changed.
In fact, a Cryo-EM study shows human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV-2 protein 10 to 20 times higher than ACE2 levels compared to S SARS-CoV protein.
What's also important to know is if there's another co-receptor that might be needed to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminoopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-teraesterase acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the ability to adapt this CoV to humans after transmission of the interspecies of its animal's bone.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of the HCoV inter-species transmission is also organized by other parental and parental termination factors.
The difference between this mother protein and the mother’s natural reserve, such as herbage, Arabic honey, and breast milk, can be a barrier to the transmission of interspecies.
HCoV has to take into account the factor of breast-feeding and the combination of breast-feeding factors to succeed in transmission of inter-species.
In this regard, molecular observations in the important areas of interaction of these important viruses must still be identified and disseminated.
Entirely unusually inspired to see the underlying factor and the termination of the SARS-CoV-2 using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be useful.
New HCoV currency: back to the beginning of the distribution
CoV's suspicion gave us a great opportunity to show up a new HCoV.
In this case, the coV is functioning as the gen HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination have led to HCoV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, the development or loss of new protein proteins can dramatically modify the phenotype of virus.
Among SARS-CoV accessories protein, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in adaptation to humans due to the virus of SARS-CoV, which is isolated from ORF8 protein levels.
SARS-CoV with a special score of 29 nucleotide found on the strand that was isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This conclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutatis mutandis that supports parental care.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV, with a larger number of smaller recombination areas identified in RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Recombination sites are also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the occurrence of recombination between the various lines of birth is shown to occur at the MERS-CoV epidemic, which took place in the Arabian Peninsula in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoV places where HCoV has experienced recombination with other animals in its non-structured gene.
It should also be expected that action selection can play a role in unsustainable change in the viral gene, perhaps caused by the release of the virus from the selective pressure that has occurred, such as the immune system.
The example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 on the strain prototype HCoV-229E due to the end of two nucleotide.
While ORF4 is fully able to be observed on the vertebrate virus and in association with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca shows a single nucleotide vaccine that causes cross-section.
Finally, the new HCoV evolution was also prompted by the selective pressure on the edge of its reserve.
A soft or non-smoker is detected during the coV infection cycle, which shows the adjustment between the coV and the radiation.
It seems that the environment fits well with CoV in anatomically and physiology.
For example, failure to detect proinflammase response in the environment will effectively cause COV-discharged pathology.
In addition, natural killer cell activity on the stomach is forced by the regulation of the NKG2/CD94 receptor receptors and the degree of molecular expression of the major Histocompatibility complex of the lower class I.
In addition, a high level of reactive oxygen (ROS) species of high-voltage metabolic activity can suppress the replication of CoV and affect the absorption by exoribonuclese so that it gives selective pressure to produce highly pathogenic viruses when entering the new nest.
A more pathogenic strain of coV may also develop through recombination, which can cause protein perspiration or new protein fibers to adapt to yellow.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that the three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two chapters.
CoV is non-pathogenic or causes light yellow in its reserve ring, such as snow and snow.
CoV is strongly applied without having a strong mother's immune response.
There's a secret here there's an unsuspecting carrier and a serious case of human infection.
The severity is particularly severe because of the increased immune response rate and sytokin levels, with increased renal impairment if the immune response increases.
On the other hand, on the carrier without the glove, the immune response has disappeared from the coV replication.
The same strategy to resolve the severity of immune response may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong on the horizon.
Therefore, type I interferon delivery, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammation is defective.
For this reason, inflammation of NLRP3 with MCC950 may be beneficial in the COVID-19 target.
The SARS-CoV-2 municipality follows the general district of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV is a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there is a 96% nucleology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the fungus and other animals on that market were found to carry a virus identical to SARS-CoV, the direct link to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
Beta-CoV trangling which is very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, indicating that trangling may play as one of the most common or beta-CoV tringing may contribute gene fragmentes to the end version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is done well by humans in whole or in part.
CoV has become the focus of the recent SARS-CoV-2 release.
CoV studies in the wild and other animals have greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal conservation for HCoV in human transmission.
A lot of evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are from the environment and is transmitted to humans through interconnected waves.
Bearing in mind that SARS-CoV infection comes from human contact and slows down on the language market, possibly the language marketer and the murder of all those who end the SARS epidemic effectively.
For the same reason, radiation should be transferred from the language market to prevent zoonotic transmission, reminding of the discovery of some of the genetic boundaries of beta-CoV radiation that are closely associated with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanism SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted to humans through radiation and other matter still needs to be identified in research in the future.
On the other hand, the MercS-CoV has been in the Arab arena for a long time.
It serves as an important transport tool and as a primary source of food, milk, skin, and wool for local communities.
The Arab are widely known throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Because of that, we can't kill all the bullets to control MERS, as is done on the wild animals market in Tiongkok to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 preaching.
In order to stop the MERS infection, a compromise should be made to develop vaccines for effective powder against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can eliminate this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause confusion.
A variety of coVs flow from the zoos in the wild.
In particular, coVs that are very efficient zoonotic are very popular.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic coV to revolutionize and experience recombination, which causes new coVs to appear easier to transmit and/or die for humans in the future.
The culture of feeding wild animals in some parts of Tingkok has to be abandoned in order to cut down unnecessary contact with humans and animals.
With the experiences of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and planning should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since then.
These viruses are in the reserve of nature until there is an opportunity to preach.
Although the virus has many characteristics that support the spread of virus, it is possible for humans to interact with it and other wild species to be cured if they are trained to avoid wild animals.
The surveillance of the mammals needs to be made to understand better the environment of the CoV and its natural mother, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animal-ke-humans and the coming of the media.
As a conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonoses virus is to protect humans from the long ecological cycle of conservation of natural zoonotic viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
First, if the virus transmits the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the radiation, the condition when the radiation and radiation divides the ecological cycle is important to be known.
Second, if greed plays a more direct role in human transmission, the way that humans deal with it must be determined.
Third, if there's a third matrix that plays a role as a ring among the real ones, the way it interacts with other species, which includes humans, the universe, and the interconnection must be explained.
Finally, because of the abundance of mammals, including the possible protection animals that may be related to SARS-CoV-2, good testing and surveillance infections should be carried out.
I don't know how to run, race, or other malady, expected that SARS-CoV-2 or his almost identical native virus could be identified in his natural mother's future.
Further research in this field will combine the evolutionist SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important involvement in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The comparison of the diagnostic criteria "sustained case" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 needs to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick advice for the diagnosis and intention of the newly infected Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). This prison was based on our experience and became a good reference to combating pandemics worldwide.
However, the COVID 2019 disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge are growing on the basis of ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, the diagnosis and intentional strategy is also being developed.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our guidance and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "sustained cases" and "confirmed cases" based on the Diagnoses and Addictions for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Commission for the Health of the Republic of Tiongkok.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has released, which is now officially referred to as Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is called Coronavirus Syndrome for acute use 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed quick advice and this guidance has been published in the Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
The couple’s interest in the truth has grown since the publication.
However, it needs to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our expertise and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; therefore, the diagnosis and intentional strategy is also being developed.
As an example of the Diagnoses and Objectives for COVID-19 issued by the National Public Health Commission in Tiongkok (http://www.hc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the Commission has issued a total of seven editions with a lot of contexts.
Our company received a comment from Zhou et al., they identified the proposal for a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds fresh evidence to our appreciation for our work and to their appreciation for the worldwide brotherhood.
We support their meaningful work and express our appreciation for them.
However, the results of their work also need to be measured on the basis of the diagnosis and hope for the latest COVID-19 (the seventh test version) and the latest study.
On the basis of the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of suspected cases requires a combination of one epidemiological rye with two clinical manifestations in order to make a comprehensive analysis, or three clinical manifestations in case there is no clear epidemiological rye:
Epidemiologists: (1) travel journeys or residences in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where the COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to pregnancy; (2) contact trips with the SARS-CoV-2 cases (with positive nuclear tests); (3) contact trips with patients suffering from the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas and other communities have been reported within 14 days of the COVID-19 cases before pregnancy; (4) confirmation of contact with classified cases (≥ 2 cases with smoke and/or weapons occurring within 2 weeks of the small area, such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical efficacy: (1) dementia and/or constipation; (2) COVID-19 infection infection prevention; (3) total white blood cell counts indicate normal lymphocyte density, decline, or decrease in early alert levels.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a complete follow-up of the virus shows high homogenity for a new known coronavirus; (3) a positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a serum trial; or a change in the specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from negative to positive, or a titer increases ≥4 litres at the above stage of recovery.
We can see that a real-time PCR test of nuclear ash in a sample of weapons or blood was added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Patogenic detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then, serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on research on the progress of researchers to find optimal nuclear detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of the respiratory system including blood transfusions, which increase the availability of various species, and support the production of certain positive antibodies in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is abundant evidence that we are alert to the dangers of wearing clothing that is tight - fitting and revealing.
That's why, the Zhou et al. has to be spread because they classify people without clinical urgency as "low risk".
In the future, however, the task of caring for the needs of the individual needs of his family is well worth the effort.
As a result, we hoped that the evidence would reach a conclusion and that we would ask the reader to comment.
For the diagnosis of "sustained cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend following and following the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team also regularly delivered helpful instructions to us.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily deaths
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day of the virus.
To date, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh has reported the number of cases of infections listed in 114 active cases and 33 cases of home - care illness.
Totally 17 deaths.
In a newspaper headline, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that death covered four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one cases between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a hostage.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corrusi Commission, who was cared for at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video release, the Minister for Road and Coastal Transport said Ouidul Quader that public transport would be stopped longer than planned, until the Saturday came.
This public transport tour has begun since March 26th and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of wood needs -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, on two newly returned from Italy and one of them was a woman.
On March 19, the three men died.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more than one million worldwide
On the day of Kims, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 corn virus infection exceeds one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronary virus.
The plan took place on the same day when Malawi confirmed the infection of its first corn virus and Zambia experienced its first deaths related to the cornea virus.
North Korea claims, on the day of Kimis, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free from the infection of the coronary virus.
To date, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within two hours from 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States (AS), there are more than 244 thousand cases of coronary virus, at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronary virus.
Throughout the world, countries have announced a stronger campaign to stop the spread of disease.
On Kamis day, Sergei Sobayin, Moscow’s capital city, extended his circuit to May 1.
According to Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians will remain paid without having to go to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament held a call for nine votes to extend the status of national courts for 15 days; the vote was slow with 215 votes supporting, ten abstentions, and one vote refused.
Saudi Arabia continued to spend the night in the holy cities of Mecca and Midian all day long; before that, it was only between three o’clock in the morning and six o’clock in the morning.
Thailand plans to spend the night between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m.
The Ohio government, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended its residence order until May 1st.
Toko-toko in Australia lowers the sales threshold of the toilets per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australia Woolworth and Cole markets each down to two and a half times a deal at all stores at national level.
GOD’S WORD also applies to a specific custom that is common today.
It was announced as a message on the screen and on the Facebook page of the network.
The buyer reported covering the preparation due to the fear of COVID-19 when the public had to carry out a stand-alone isolation.
On Rapu’s day, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet toilets to the house to a postmaster.
This change follows the end of four pairs of transactions that were previously introduced to Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In his press statement on March 8th, Cole reported that with a four-person rapist, "many stores have been destroyed in one hour since the sender", and called it "before it happened", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Saturday, called it "unexpected".
The sale of "increasing" last week, according to one of the Woolworths talks.
Toko Costco in Canberra also limited the number allowed up to two weeks ago.
To avoid confusion, Cole arranged a greater amount of time than the sender and increased the frequency of the sender, Woolworths arranged additional preparations, while ALDI made preparations for the special Arab promotion activity that was originally prepared.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australia's Peritel Association, said that the peritel tried to improve the preparation, but the local government's limit for time delivery made it difficult.
He's putting together the production fee, while the buyers try to meet the demand, and a little more special promotion.
On the Day of Judgment, God announced that because of the advance of preparation, some stores could not produce a special rabbi.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, director of the Queensland University of Technology, said that the store was full of preparations every night.
He stressed that the toilet roof was a large volume thing so that the amount of preparation was low and, if sold, made many empty rooms in the boys so that the mess was getting worse.
Colles and Woolworths think [that] if there's a lot of stuff in the smoke, if the product like towels and torture can be bought and there's a lot of money, then maybe it's possible that it's possible, by means of the U.S. news agency, Russell Zimmerman.
The toilet product for the Who Gives a Crap said on the last Wednesday that they're ready to disappear.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Kleenex Toilet Tisu, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, forced them to work 24/7 to keep up, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some self-sellers offer free toilet tickets to the first diver in Melbourne, while a little slower is set up because the buyer takes a boat for a long break at the end of the Spring Day.
The edition of The NT News, a daily edition published in Darwin, lists eight references to the dream to be sung and used as the title of the toy.
Toko-toko actually refused to apply the restrictions, according to the Australian ABC report on 3 March, they said that they did not intend to apply the purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, torture, cold food, handbags, and cheese.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday morning’s supermarket in England, the U.S.A., it was considered to limit the purchase of Andre’s tortoises to 12 hilltops.
World Health Organization (WHO) says COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that COVID-19 was happening -- the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus -- as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" is only a sign of the spread of disease, it is not a very dangerous case, WHO writes that it needs to motivate the government to act:
All countries are still able to make changes in their visas.
If the state of emergency, testing, handling, insulation, and mobilizing its people as a response, then Tedros Adhanom Ghereyesus, Director General WHO, will be succeeded.
We were very careful about the extent of our preaching activity and the extent to which we were concerned, and the extent of our activity.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this attack "has never occurred before."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "except for influenza, there is no weapon virus that has ever been launched from its infancy to the progressive global preaching."
GHebrewesus said something like this, saying, "We've never seen the pandemic that's been hit by Coronavirus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new regime followed WHO’s decision in January, which stated this statement as a global public health threat.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this phenomenon, "in other words, it would be bad."
To Kamis, Associated Press reports at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, which affects more than 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020 is a Coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) that is continuing and caused by the Coronavirus acute weaponization syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Published in Wuhan, Tiongkok, December 2019; now known as the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020; now known as the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, which have caused about 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people are cured.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4% in Tiongkok, while the whole world falls from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
A common cold, a cold, and even a breath.
The complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from sunset to sunset is about five days, but it can range from two to four in the next four days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive action involves washing your hands, closing your mouth when you are stoned, caring for the distance from others, and taking care of yourself and isolation for those who are expected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by making travel restrictions, quarantines, nighttimes, workplace risk control, and factory surveillance.
This trend has led to severe global economic and social unrest, bans or distortions of cultural, political, economic, social and social activities, as well as a widespread decline in the supply of goods.
Schools and universities have been closed to national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world’s students.
The information about this virus has spread to the ground and there are xenophobicins and discrimination against the Tionghoa people, with the births and sights of East and South Asia, and those from the area with the significant virus cases.
As a result of reduced travel and heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
The health authorities in Wuhan, Tiongkok (Hubei's promulgation kit), reported the pneumonia cluster with unknown reasons on December 31, 2019 and the investigation was conducted early in January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Sea Food Market and therefore the virus is supposed to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the release is called SARS-CoV-2, the new virus that has been detected and has been in contact with cholera virus, circulatory coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first with the disease was diagnosed on December 1, 2019, and the person who did not have a clear relationship with the language-based classer later mentioned.
In the first class of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link to that market.
On March 13, 2020, a report not yet audited from South China Morning Post suggests that a case that could be resolved on November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old in the province of Hubei, is probably the first one. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case being reported down in Tingkok, but gradually increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside Tingkok has increased to the number of new cases in Tingkok for the first time.
There may be a number of unreported cases, especially among people with more severe disabilities.
Until 26 February, relatively few cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds below 2.4% cases worldwide. The head of British scientist Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of England’s population needs infection before the group can be reached.
Cases have fallen to the number of people who have been tested by COVID-19 and whose results have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By March 23, there were no countries that tested more than 3% of their population, and many countries have made it official that they do not try people with weak disabilities, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in Tiongkok, up to 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infection was not detected, and that undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of cases documented.
A statistical analysis published on 30 Maret suggests that the number of infections in Italy is expected to be greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that this figure is likely to be 5.7.
Most of the pain of COVID-19 is getting worse.
For those who do not recover, the period between 6 and 41 days from an increase of about 14 days is generally 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in adults over 60 years of age and 75% had previous health disorders, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official deaths resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic usually lead to deaths that resulted in a positive test for COVID according to the official protocol.
The actual fatality resulting from the COVID-19 may be much higher, remembering that the official figure may not include those who died without testing, for example, at home, at the hospital, dsb.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths exceeding the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official death benefit of the COVID with a 4-5-fold factor.
A female spokesman for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits, "We know [the number of deaths reported] is lower than the actual number", a statement reinforced by an unknown report on the U.S. hits too low. The most common side effects occur in pandemics, such as the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death is in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first deaths outside Tiongkok were held on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first deaths in outside Asia were held in France on February 14.
Until 28 February, outside Tiongkok village, more than one death cell was recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Up to 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths, in each province, except Antarctica.
This figure varies according to the region and frequency of time, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of the health system, the choice of choice, the time from the first time, and the character of the population such as age, type of safety, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to the case represents the number of deaths of terdiagnoses in a time interval determined.
According to statistics by Johns Hopkins University, the death rate for the global case was 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) for 10 April 2020.
It's a variation according to the area.
In Tiongkok, the estimate of mortality ratios from 17.3% (for people with 1-10 January 2020) has become 0.7% (for people with disabilities after 1 February 2020). Other claims include the fatalities (CFRs), which represent the percentage of people with certain diseases, and the incidences of infections (IFR), which represent the percentage of the people with whom the disease has died.
This statistics are not limited to time and are followed by a particular population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these figures for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the fatalities of infection for pandemics worldwide between 0.1% and 0.33%.
The paper on this estimate runs with the results of the first test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical survey that analyzes the findings of the CFR estimate.
WHO confirmed that this pandemic could be controlled.
The point and the end of this publication are not clear and may vary from place to place.
Maciej Boni of the Penn State University says, "No matter how controlled, the porter usually arrives and then begins to sink when the disease is the mother's destruction that is prepared.
But it's almost impossible to make a project that goes in right now about when it's happening."
Senior government medical adviser Tiongkok zhong Nanshan thinks that "this campaign may end June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to grow, possibly up to one or two years."
According to the Imperial College research conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical closures and other steps will be required "until the vaccine is available (in 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University says, "I feel a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear all of it" and this disease "may change into a temporary disease, which comes back every year."
Violence will depend on the ability of the group and the height of the mutatis mutandis.
The COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and the infected person can be without it.
Two of the most common spices are dementia (88%) and fatty stones (68%).
The most common side effects include nausea, flegma, loss of appetite, respiratory and bone pain, headaches, headaches, nausea, vomiting, haemorrhage, diarrhoea, or synoses. WHO states that about one in six people have a severe disease and experience breathing problems.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the U.S. Department of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) welcomes the incidence of respiratory problems, heart attacks or brain damage, inflammation of the liver, swelling of the face, and swelling of the face and lips; medical attention is quickly reduced if these events occur. Further development of disease can be a harmful pneumonia, syndrome inhibiting acute breathing, sepsis, septic pain, and death.
Some people who are infected may be asymptomatic, they may not have a clinical diagnosis, but with test results confirming the infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close to those who are confirmed should be fixed and tested to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa people estimate the asymptotic race is from a few to 44 percent.
Incubation periods (times between infection and geese avalanche) usually fall between 1 to 14 days, often at least 5 days. For example, uncertainty is the estimate of the number of COVID-19 injuries that were first lost by 30%, and then fell to 15%.
The controversy over how this disease spreads is still under way.
The COVID-19 message is believed primarily to occur at the time of contact and through small droplets produced during stone, sand, or conversation; the contact is contact within a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that uncovered stone can cause a droplet of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers suggest that the virus may also be transmitted by a smaller droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when speaking. The droplet can also be produced when it releases the breath, including when speaking, even though this virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall into the mouth or the nose of the person who is near it or may live in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and heart attack (RJP), can make the secret of aerosol and spread through the air.
It can also happen when a person touches a person’s surface, including his skin, and when he touches a person’s eyes, skin, and mouth.
Although there is some concern that the virus can spread through the fesses, this risk is low.
The Tiongkok government denied the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in an informal manner.The virus most spreads within the first three days after the broadcasts, although the preaching may take place before the sighting and at the next level of disease.
A positive test was performed until three days before the event, which indicates that the transmission might take place before a significant event.
Only a few reports of asymptotic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but the asymptotic findings have been identified by some countries during the study of the contact details.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person in general infected two to three others.
In particular, it has been found that the virus can be detected for up to three days in plastics (polypropylene) and a 304-day cardboard, one day in cardios, and more than four hours in tobacco.
However, this diversity depends on soil and heat, and food and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread viruses to humans, even though the British authorities suggest that they wash their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with a surface that may have been infected by the infected person.
Coronavirus acute drug syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with the acute infectious disease cluster in Wuhan.
All of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus is related to the coronavirus in nature. In the human body, this virus can be destroyed if a family member is present, which will prolong its protection amplifier. SARS-CoV-2 is very close to SARS-CoV at first.
The virus is supposed to have zoonotic origins.
Genetic analysis reveals that the genetically classified coronavirus with the Betacoronavirus gene, in the Sarbecovirus subgenus (b line) with two vertebrates.
This virus has 96% equivalent to the total level of the gene with the other vertebral coronavirus (BatCov RATG13).
In February 2020, researchers from Tionghoa found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the sequence between the connected virus and the human virus.
So far, the overall ratio of gene found the largest 92% of genetic material between connective coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that interconnecting is the opposite of SARS-CoV-2.
The virus infection can be diagnosed temporarily on the basis of pregnancy, but confirmation is finally done by reacting through the reverse polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in the infected secret or through CT screening.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan shows that CT significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many anti-pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "CT cannot be used for writing or as the first linear test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has issued some RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first issued on 17 January.
A test using the polymerase transcriptic reverse linear reaction (rRT-PCR).
A test can be performed in the form of a knife or a blood test.
The results were widely available for hours and days.
In general, this test is performed on a nonsmoker, but it can also be used, and a number of laboratories and companies are developing an antibodies serology test.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these serology tests proved sufficient to be widely accepted.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for use only by a certified laboratory.
The characteristic of the radiitric and tomography is computerized (CT) in humans who automatically include ground glass peripheral opiates asymmetric and no fluorine effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is setting up an international database for the appointment of a confirmed case.
Because of the outbreak of other infections such as adenovirus, non-confirmation of the PCR has a limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A major study in Tingkok compared the results of breast CT with PCR and showed that despite the lack of specifics for infection, breast-feeding is faster and more sensitive so that it is recommended to be considered as a device in the epidemi field.
The network of neuronal convolutives based on art has been developed to detect virus detection with radiographics and CT.
The strategy to prevent the spread of this disease includes maintaining a good personal hygiene in a comprehensive manner, washing hands, avoiding eye contact, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and using bone during a stone or washing and immediately removing your hair to a place of gravel.
Those who may already have been infected are urged to wear a mask in public.
In many areas, the government has restricted or forced all unnecessary travel to and from the country and the affected areas.
However, in most parts of the world, the average life span in the world is much shorter.
This means that the virus has spread to the public, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Health care for those who may be infected is recommended to perform standard prevention, contact prevention, and eye protection. Contact planning is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further infection.
The use of local data from the telephone by the government for this purpose has created a private problem, with the exception of Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that call for this kind of surveillance.
Various applications have been implemented or advised to be used voluntarily, and on April 7, 2020, more than a team of experts have worked out a private network solution, such as using Bluetooth to record a user-wide approach to other phones.
Next, the user will receive a message if they are close to someone who is positive for the COVID-19.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing our hands in order to avoidance of disease.
CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least two decades, especially after toilets or when the hands appear dirty; before they eat; and after washing their teeth, stones, or salt.
This injury is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by a family member that destroys its protection.
Further, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand washing with less than 60% alcohol content based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands.
The surface can be decodonamined using a number of lactations (in one minute the spray is infected for the surface surface of the karta), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other ingredients, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconeate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if COVID cases are suspected or confirmed in public facilities, such as office or child care facilities, all areas such as office, living room, public area, electronic equipment, such as tablet, touchboard, keyboard, remote control, and ATM devices used by the sufferer, should be disinfected.
Health - care organizations recommend that people shut their mouths and wipe them out with the hair they wear or use with the hair they wear when they are rocked or dirty and then quickly wash them away.
The mask is recommended for those who may have been infected because of the use of masks that can limit the volume and duration of the ventriloquist droplets that occur during speech, washing, and stone.
WHO has issued instructions on time and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces with a lack of clean hands, which is the main source of control."The mask is also recommended to be used by those who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of COVID-19, although WHO also admits that using masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to promote the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of a non-medicine masks. It specifically recommends the use of a medical mask once in a while for a healthy society, especially when approaching (1 meter (3 foot) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing masks when using public transportation or when living in many places.
Thailand’s health has encouraged people to make coffee at home and to clean it up every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned their citizens from going out to public places without wearing masks or covering their teeth and lips.
On March 16, Vietnam invited all its officials to wear masks when they went to a public place to defend themselves and others.
The Austrian government forced everyone to enter a convent to wear a mask.
Israel asked all of his servants to wear a beard when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced tens of millions of masks per day since the middle of March, has been entrusted with the responsibility of train and bus driver wearing masks on April 1.
Panama is responsible for the use of facial masks every time it comes out of the house, and it commends the design of the facial masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social exclusion (also referred to as physical termination) is an infection control action designed to slow the spread of disease by making contact between individuals.
Social exclusion involves quarantine; travel; and education; job, workplace, stadium, theater, or financial center.
People can use social networking methods to live at home, limit their travel, avoid contact with people, and protect the physical well - being of others.
Today, many governments have a measure of responsibility or even a threat to the welfare of their citizens.
The largest group of people recommended by the U.S. governments and health organizations is rapidly monitored, starting from 250 people (unless there is a COVID-19 message in one area) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany prohibits public meetings involving more than two people. Lansia and people with medical conditions have been subjected to such conditions as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and the suspected immune system that have a higher risk of serious disease and CDC complications for possible residences in areas that are open to society. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social exclusion" as "physical exclusion", to indicate that its aim is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relations, either in virtually or from far-reaching.
The use of the term "social exclusion" has led to the fact that a person must completely isolate himself from society and not force people to remain in contact with others by alternative means.
This recommendation includes a commitment to sexual relations only with people who live with you and do not have a virus or virus history.
Isolation stays at home is recommended for those diagnosed suffering COVID-19 and those who are expected to be infected.
Many governments have been responsible for or recommend their citizenship for all the people who live in the affected areas.
Carantine's instruction stands the strongest issued for people who are in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been suffering from COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to the country or region with the COVID-19 widely recommended to carry out quarantine for 14 days since the possibility of a final strike.
The strategy in public control is protection or surprise, as well as meditation.
Protection is done at the early stage of the campaign and aims to track and isolate infected people and take other steps to control infection and vaccines aimed at stopping the spread of disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of disease, the next step is to switch to a mythical level: these steps are taken to slow down the preaching process and reduce its visibility on the health and social care system.
Combine protective action and meditation can be done at the same time.
Supresi requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive rate to less than 1st part of the spread of infectious diseases is trying to lower the epidemi peaks, known for controlling the epidemi curve.
This lowers the risk of high - risk health services and gives more time to the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-farmist interventions to deal with obstacles to the prevention of individuals, such as the cleaning of their hands, the wearing of facial masks, and the quarantine of their faces; the steps to social levels intended for physical destruction, such as closing schools and canceling public meetings; social security to stimulate reception and participation in such interventions; and the steps to the environment, such as cleaning of the surface. Other drastic actions aimed at covering them are carried out in Tingkok when the public is real, such as completing the entire city and making a difficult journey.
Other countries also take various steps to limit the use of viruses.
South Korea recognizes the origin of mass and quarantine, as well as warnings about the movement of infected people.
Apologize for the financial support of a person who has been infected with carantine and who has had a major stroke for a person who has failed to do so.
Taiwan improves the production of face masks and condemns medical preparation. Simulations for England and the United States show that mitigating (suspends, but does not stop the preaching of epidemics) and surprises (referring the growth of epidemics) have a major challenge.
Optimised nursing can reduce the demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but it still causes hundreds of thousands of deaths and existing health systems.
Suprepi can be selected, but it must be kept in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if it is first reached), because if it is not, the suspension will return immediately when the suspension steps are dropped.
Long-term interventions to pressure the pandemic bring attention to social and economic factors.
No specific antiviral medicine has been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing tests.
Suspension of free fluids, adequate drinking water, and a relaxed atmosphere can help relieve anxiety.
Depending on the level of fatigue, oxygen therapy, intravenous bleeding, and armaments may be required.
The use of steroids can damage the patient’s condition.
Some of the animals previously approved for treatment of other virus diseases are being addressed to be used in treating COVID-19.
WHO also says that some "traditional and home treatment" can defeat the scourge caused by SARS-CoV-19.

There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called nol patient).
The first reported cases of cancer can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
In one month, the number of cases of caronavirus in Hubei increased dramatically.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Sea Food Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin.

A number of senior administrations of the Tiongkok Province Party (CPC) have been halted by the closure of its efforts in Central Tiongkoh, which is a sign of the failure of the political bureau's response to the media in the region.
Some commentators believe that this step is meant to protect the secretary-general of the Tiongkok Xi Jinping Communist Party from public anger related to the coronavirus.
Some Tiongkok officials, such as Zhao Lijian, refused prior recognition of the coronavirus version starting in Wuhan, and supported the conspiracy theory on COVID-19 from the US or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump called the Coronavirus "Tiongkok virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "Tiongkok's closing actions gave power to the virus that is now changing into a global pandemic."

The Daily Beast receives a message from the U.S. government that sets up a communication strategy and clearly comes from the National Security Hall, with a strategy defined as "All about Tingkok.

The Head of Foreign Affairs of the European Union Joseph Borrell warns that there is "a geo-political composition, which includes a struggle to gain influence through the exchange of facts and "supply policy".

Jack Ma's contributions were 100,000 masks for Cuba blocked by the US sanctions on April 3rd.
The U.S. government has also been charged with distributing aid to other countries in their own countries.

The source accused Russia of attacking the geopolitical and diplomatic character.
President Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy Luigi Di Mayo rejected the media report and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo ships to the United States for medical assistance.
The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says that "when you offer help to your friends in the United States, [Putin] assumes that if the U.S. equipment and medical products get an opportunity, they will also be able to repay if necessary."
NATO military training "defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, namely NATO's largest military training since the end of the Cold War, will be on a smaller scale.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Security Campaign Kate Hudson criticised the training of Defender 2020: "In the present public health crisis, this training not only endangers the lives of the US and many participating European countries, but also the citizens of the country where they operate."The Iranian government is seriously affected by this virus, with about two members of parliament being affected by five political figures at the time or earlier.
On March 14, 2020, Iran President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders to ask for help and said that his country had difficulty fighting hunger because of lack of access to the international market as a result of the US sanctions against Iran. This led to the United States of America's reconciliation to adopt general social security in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, family income, and higher levels of education for social health.
Political analysts estimate that this could be a negative opportunity for Donald Trump to be re-elected in the election of the President in 2020, and the diplomatic relationship between Japan and South Korea was damaged by this attack.
South Korea criticises "the Japanese adventure and passport" after Japan announces that everyone who comes from South Korea will be placed in the quarantine for two weeks at a place where the government is shown.
At first, South Korea's public opinion was partly related to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed a petition, which is well documented by Moon's comments, based on their complaints about government errors in the media, and commend their attitude.
Some commentators expressed concern that it would allow the government to strengthen its confidence in power.
In Hungary, his parliament chose to allow the Ministerial Guard, Victor Orbán, to rule by decree without time, to stop parliament and elections, and to punish those who are supposed to spread false information about the virus and the purpose of the crisis by the government.
Coronavirus vaccines are based on cases of lack of oxygen, resulting from an increase in global use of equipment to combat fatigue, panic attacks, and industrial and logistics interruptions.
The U.S. Department of Medicine and Food issues a warning of the lack of drugs and medical equipment by increasing the demand for food and nutrition.
Some areas also experience procurement due to panic attacks that affect the need for wood, such as food, towels, and bottled water, which reduce the loss of fuel.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of the spread of electronic messages.
According to the director general WHO Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self - protective equipment increased 100 times the limit.
This request resulted in an increase of up to twelve times the normal price and an increase of four to six months for medical supplies.
This also causes a lack of self-defense equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that it will endanger health.
In Australia, customers offered new opportunities to sell Australia’s products in Tiongkok.
This activity affects formulae in some supermarkets and has finally been banned by the Australian government. The prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the demand for food, both areas are protected from food shortages.
The differences between Tiongkok and Italy in the fight against the development and trade of illegal products have been significant to prevent the shortage of acute food that is believed to occur in Europe and North America.
It is not northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, yet it does not have a literal harvest, but it can increase prices according to industry.
Food shortages are only temporary, even in the city of Wuhan, often followed by the loss of sufficient food supplies for the public.
Similar conditions exist in Italy, which is responsible for food products to keep advice for such emergencies.
The global economic collapse has been felt in Tiongkok: According to a media report on 16 March, the economy in Tiongkok was deeply affected in the first two months of 2020 by the government's efforts to keep the virus out of control, and by 20.5% of the retail sales of bicycles.
Since Tiongkok is the center of the economy and major factors, the virus is considered to pose a major threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais from the Economist Intelligence Unit suggests that the market will continue to decline until there is a clearer picture of the potential for the final outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts suggested that seeing an economic downturn on global growth could spread SARS in 2002-2004.

Epidemi competes with Chunyun, a leading travel period associated with the New Year’s holiday.
A number of events involving many people have been dismissed by central and district governments, including the New Year's Festival of the Year of the Year, and secret companies are also standing in the middle of the trade and trading venues, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year’s events and places of worship were closed to prevent mass meetings, including the Banned City in Beijing and traditional temples.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, towns, and districts of Tingkok, the authorities extended the New Year’s holiday to February 10 and ordered that most jobs not be reopened until that date.
These areas are 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong improves the incidence of infectious diseases at the highest level and announces emergency situations, shuts down schools to Maret, and cancels New Year's events. The railway sector is globally affected by a reduction in working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to a mine in Europe and Latin America dropped by 40%.
The North American and Middle East experienced 50-60% births.
This also affects 33-43% of the birth rate after walking to the center of March compared to February.
Economic operators around the world take additional steps, such as the increase in the health of their partners, the demand for buyers, and the distribution of events. According to the opinion of the PBB Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic can cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase from 14 to 22 million people compared with the situation without prejudice.
In January and February 2020, during an epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in Tiongkok lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million migrant workers from Tiongkok were housed in the province of the interior or captured in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the Coronavirus can result in 47 million jobs in the United States and an increase of 32%. The quarantine in India has resulted in the number of millions of migrant workers (paid through the daily wage). Surveys from Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canada's households have experienced similar loss of employment. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since it was held in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, a large number of four million French workers took part-time leadership, and 1 million British workers conducted a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany conducted a short-term work plan under the supervision of the government for their staff, called Kurzber.
Germany’s short-term compensation scheme was approved by France and England.
Around the world, the field of art shows and cultural heritage are exposed by the pandemic, which affects organisations and individuals, good work done and standing up.
The arts and cultural organizations strive to fulfill their mission (which is often publicized) to give cultural heritage to the public, to maintain social and social health, and to support the arts if they can afford it.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, exhibitions, exhibitions, and other cultural institutions were closed without time, with celebrations, events, and shows.
In view of this, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The most recent and very rapid elimination of this disease is the exchange of economic services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music and concerts, technology conferences, and oral relations.
The film industry has also been under ban, declaring that the Christmas celebration in Rome, which fell in the last week of the Christian Passover, was cancelled.
Many achievements encourage Christian women to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, radio, television, while others offer drive-in or leisure worship.

Since its release of the COVID-19, it has been noted that there has been an increase in racism, xenophobia, and racism against the people of Tionghoa and East Asia, as well as those of the regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Insidences of fear, frustration, and hostility are prevalent in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Passific region.
A report from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in Tiongkok) lists racial feelings expressed in various groups around the world that the Tionghoa people deserve to receive a virus or accept what they claim to be a permanent reward.
Some African countries have also experienced an increase in anti-Tiongkok's feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on their origins.
There has been support for the Tionghoa people, the wells and the lions, and for the people in the area where the virus hits.
Following public developments in new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first countries in Europe experienced serious COVID-19, can also be a source of shock and xenophobics. The war in the countries includes Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea originally signed a petition to prevent Tinghoa from entering their country in an effort to stop disease.
In Japan, #ChinaDontComeTo Japan has become a train on Twitter.
The Tinghoa and other Asians in England and the United States reported an increase in racial strife and aggression.

The laboratory tests for coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 include methods to detect the presence of viruses and to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The level of virus in the sample is confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects the RNA coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 brain.
This test is used to confirm a new or active infection.
Antibodies (serology) detection can be used for diagnosis and population surveillance.
An antibodies show the number of people who have been infected, including those who are too weak to be reported or who are not aware of it.
The exact number of disease mortality and the prevalence of the group in the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Because of limited testing, until March 2020, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
Up to 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge variation in the number of tests carried out by countries.
This variable may also be significantly affected by the number of cases reported, which are likely to be high in some countries.
Using the linear reaction of the polymerase transcriptic back real-time (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on a sample of tools used with various methods, including a evaporation or a sputum sample.
The results usually last only a few hours until two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on the upper arm can only be performed on the first week of the disease.
After all, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to apply in the lungs.
As an alternative, for the infected person tested in two weeks, the sample material can be taken from the liver cells by using the appropriate label or the sputum extract.
One of the first PCR tests developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 used a polymerase transcriptic response (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 testing tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England Raya also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korea's Kogenebiotech has developed SARS-CoV-2-based PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) that is critical of the clinical trials on 28 January 2020.
This device searches the gene "E" that contains all the coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In Tiongkok, BGI Group is one of the first companies to agree on the use of resources from the National Medicines Administration for SARS-CoV-2-based PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes RT-PCR Real-Time Coronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCoV) to the public health laboratory via the International Reagant Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version test tools resulted in incredible results due to reaction errors, and the limited number of trials on CDC in Atlanta; this affects at least 100 rates per day in the process throughout February 2020.
The testing of two components was considered impossible until February 28, 2020, and only then was the country’s laboratory and the local laboratory permitted to perform the tests.
This test was approved by the U.S. Medical and Food Agency based on the Authority for the Use of Diarrhoea. The US commercial laboratory began its investigation at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the release of the COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR at national level.
Similarly, the Quest Diagnostics made the COVID-19 test nationally available on 9 March 2020.
No quota limit has been announced; collection and processing of the species must be done according to CDC conditions.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the VECTOR Country Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, these tests were listed by the Federal Services for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop trials to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours with a high volume so that a machine could perform approximately 4.128 tests during 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an authorisation of the use of the strains (U.S.) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorisation for Hholic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepidhe also received the U.S. from the FDA for a 45 - minute test.
The FDA has agreed to a test using an amplification technology that is not a PCR.
Because there is no need for a range of heat exchange cycles, this method can only produce positive results within five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At present, about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott continue to increase production to produce 50,000 daily tests. A test using monoclonal antibodies specifically based on new nucleocapsid (Protein N) coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping to produce results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid influenza test.
A stock market survey published in March 2020 concluded that "toraks photo has a small diagnostic value at the initial stage, one of the CT [computed tomography] may already exist before the crash."
Special hits on CT include ground-glass multilobar bilateral opiates with peripheral, asymmetric distribution, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura domination, paving craziness, and consolidation are often associated with the development of disease.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the original point of the pandemic shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although not specifically, with a wide range of pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "CT cannot be used for printing or as the first line test in the COVID-19 diagnosis." In March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for initial printing.
Part of the immune response to infection is an antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infection in individuals for about 7 days after pregnancy, to determine immunity to disease, and in population monitoring. Research can be done in the central laboratory (CLT) or with a point-of-care (PoCT).
The automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to do this research, but its availability will depend on production levels for each system.
For CLT, it is generally used as a peripheral blood specialist, although a number of species can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCTs, generally one peripheral blood species is used by skin groups.
Unlike the PCR method, extra action is not needed prior to the investigation. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide information to the Agency as needed and that can now distribute their antibiotics tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was agreed by the FDA on the basis of the authorisation of the use of the virus. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics agreed to Europe for their test tools that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to viruses in blood samples.
The patient’s test was up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so it was much faster than a conventional PCR check on RNA virus.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the outbreak of infection. In early April, England found that none of the antibiotics it bought was good enough to be used.
Hong Kong proposed a scheme so that patients who were suspected of staying at home, "departmental care would give a specific link to the patient," they went into it, sent it back, and obtained results later. NHS England announced that NHS was pioneering a case trial in the home so that other patients would lose risk if they came to the hospital or had to infect an ambulance if they were used. In a follow-up trial for cases of COVID-19, a professional health authority would take samples using appropriate protective measures.
On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Germans said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the streets and 10,700 tests were performed a week earlier.
Money is charged by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a capacity of 160,000 samples per week.
On March 19th, a severe test was performed in several large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested until and including weeks 12/20 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) positive effects for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested methods to test samples from 64 patients jointly, by combining samples and only further testing if a sample was found positive. In Wuhan, the laboratory detecting a mass of 2,000 metres of "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin language: fire, or "Fi Fire" in Indonesian) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction being supervised by BGI Wang Jian and eating for 5 days, the model shows that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the cost related to quarantine purposes can be doubled if this test capacity is not available.
Wuhan's laboratory was immediately followed by Huo-Yan's laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in 12 cities throughout Tiongkok.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity is 50,000 trials per day. The multiplex design of open source by Origami Assays can test many 1.222 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 studies. This equivalent design can be performed in a small laboratory without the need for robotic radiation.
By March, the number of unencumbered and unskilled reactions had grown to include mass tests in the European Union, England, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are trying to explore the sample advertising protocol that involves sampling at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA gene for further testing. On March 31, the Arab Union was reported to perform more coronavirus tests per population capital compared with any country, and are ready to increase the level of testing to reach a large proportion of the population.
This has been achieved through a combination of launch tests and laboratory purchases resulting in mass population estimates from Group 42 and BGI (based on the Huo-Yan laboratory detection of the "Huo-Yan" in Tingkok).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is able to perform thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside Tiongkok.
Various studies highlight the various genetic profiles of Coronaviruses developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has approved Germany's approval for producing testing tools sent to countries with low levels of energy to develop.
Germany's reception was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Center for Disease Control was not prepared until January 28 to complete the tests in the United States. At the beginning of the press, Tiongkok and the United States were troubled by the frequency of tests; both countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient testing tools to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that the wide range of tests in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of new coronaviruses.
The test capacity, mostly in the private sector labs, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16th, the World Health Organization introduced the development of the test programme as the best way to speed up the COVID-19 attacks. A high demand for testing because of the extensive virus preaching has resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests waiting for work in the U.S. secret laboratory, and the preparation of a high-performance tool and chemical reactors.
In March 2020, Tiongkok reported on the accident with his test tools.
In the United States, a test device developed by CDC has "missed"; the government then removed the bureaucracy bans that prevented the test by secret. Spanish purchased testing equipment from Tiongkok Shenzhen Bioeeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The company explained that the wrong result could have resulted in failure to collect samples or use the test tools correctly.
The Spanish Kementary said they would attract the resulting devices, and replace them with other test tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test equipment purchased by the Czech Republic from Tingkok provides incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test tools from Tingkok that were not really accurate.
Minister Matovic's army suggested that this test device be removed to the Danube. The Turkish Health Kementary Fire says Turkish testing tools have "high error levels" and they do not "use it." Inggris Raya bought 3.5 million test tools from Tingkok, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
The test, followed by the quarantine of positive people and the positive SARS-CoV-2 people, brings positive results.
Investigators working in the city of Vo Italy, the first death site of COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two tests on the entire population of 3,400 people, with a length of about 10 days.
About half of the people who were optimistic have no clues, and all the cases found in his accounts.
With the end of the journey to this community, a new infection was introduced once again.
With aggressive contact schedules, entry closures, testing, and quarantines, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has grown much less than other developing countries, although without extreme closures, such as restaurant restrictions and travel companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore recommended that residents stay at home on 28 March, but schools were reopened right after the holiday on 23 March.
Other countries also deal with pandemics with aggressive contact schedules, exits, tests, and quarantines, but with less aggressive circuits, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that have tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower incidence of cases, perhaps because these countries are more able to detect people who have weak or without disabilities.
WHO recommends that countries with no test capacity, and the national laboratory with limited experience of COVID-19, send five positive samples COVID-19 and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratories for confirmation tests.
From 16 laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following context, the column "%The positive test results" is affected by the country's pilots.
The country that only tested people in the hospital would have a higher percentage of positive results compared with the country that tested all its inhabitants, whether they showed cruelty or not, with other factors.
Washing hands, which is also called hand washing, is an act that cleans the hands of someone who intends to wipe out the dust, oil, microorganisms, or other undesirable matter.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" all day prevents many of the diseases, such as fever and cholera, which are spread through the fecal-oral route.
People can also be treated with infectious diseases, such as influenza or selesma, if they do not wash their hands before touching eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucosa).
Five hours of critically important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after a large amount of water, after cleaning the baby’s milk or changing the baby’s milk, before feeding the child, before and after preparing food or meat, fish, or vegetables.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be cleaned with stuff. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing a meal.
Before and after care for the sick.
After changing the tires or cleaning the child’s toilet.
After cleaning up the skin, the stones, or the ashes.
After touching animals, eating meat, or eating meat.
Medical hygiene is a violation of the hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medical treatment or treatment may prevent or even reduce the risk of disease.
The primary medical purpose of washing hands is to clean hands from pathogens (bacterium, virus, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who are caring for their health or who are working in the medical field.
Washing hands has a lot of health benefits, including preventing influenza, coronary virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing respiratory infections; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce infant mortality rates at home.
A study in 2013 showed that the increase in the effectiveness of hand washing can slightly increase the growth of high news children.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children is reduced by the fact that they have an increased number of deaths, such as an increase in the number of deaths and deaths of children, by marked changes in their behavior, such as the washing of hands with soap.
This simple act may reduce the mortality rate by up to 50 percent.
Interventions that encourage hand drying can reduce cases of hunger to the same extent; these can be carried out by providing clean water in the affected areas.
48% of the cancer reduction can be associated with toothache. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and easy way to prevent toothache and acute skin infections (ISPA), as a low-performance behavior carried out in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the primary ISPA, is the cause of the death of one newspaper; this disease causes about 1.8 million deaths per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashes before eating and using toilets as a regular habit can save more lives from any vaccine or medical action, and reducing the effects of death until almost half and death due to acute finish infection until immediately.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitary measures as part of the water, sanitation, and cleaning program (WASH).
Washing your hands also protects yourself from the impetigo that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
The small side effects of drying hands are hand washing that is often done can cause skin damage.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that more hand washing can lead to catalytic skin and drying, known as hand rash or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health officials.
Washing hands too often is also considered one of obsessive-compulsive (OCD).
There are five hours of criticism all day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the spread of disease effectively, namely: before and after using toilets (small water, large water waste), after cleaning the child’s breast (change of the baby), before breast feeding, before eating and before/after preparing food or meat, fish, or meat.
Another important time to use the technique to wash the right hands of the patient is before and after the wound; after washing, stone, or ironing; after touching an animal or touching an animal; and after touching a wound.
In many countries, it is still the custom to wash hands with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that 38.7% of married households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study shows that Saudi Arabia has a highest rate of 97%; the United States is nearly 77%; and Tiongkok is now under a low level of 23%. Now there are some methodologies to improve behavioral Adoptiveness with soap during the crisis. Washing hands for students at a time when they have been selected is one of the choices in the developing countries to raise their hands in children's behavior.
The Department of Education in the Philippines provides an excellent example of practical ways to support children’s health and education.
Two times a year, added by washing hands every day with soap and drying teeth every day with fluoride, is the meaning of this national program.
The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Skin microorganisms are strengthened by the addition of seed or waste to water.
The main task of sowing and harvesting is to reduce the demand for seed and increase the quantity of grain.
Just water is a skin cleanser that is not efficient because of fat and protein, which is a component of organic waste, is not easy to wash in water.
In such a case, fresh air and fresh water can help to wash our hands and to maintain our water supply.
The fat soap, because it can be reused, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that investigated the contamination of the bacteria from the somnolence infected concluded that it was not possible to do so because the bacteria were bled by the dust.
However, the CDC continues to say, "The field of soil that comes out of the rain without having a more comfortable hand."
The antibacterial soap has been widely encouraged to a healthy society.
To date, there has been no evidence that the use of antiseptics or infections recommended is better for an antibiotic-containing organism in the natural world.
However, antibacterial soap contains such a general antibacterial agent as triclosan, which has a wide list of organisms with a wide range of resistance.
So even though the strain of antibiotics is not targeted by antibiotics, the strain may not have an effect based on it.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, the mucous formulations may include ash (asytat, ascorbic acid, lactate salt) as pH adjustment, benzoate as an active antimicrobial as well as further skin conditioner (liquids, vitamins, mangol, fruit extract). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon’s Health College shows that the common soap is the same with the high levels of antibacterium that contains tricloses in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from hand.
The warm, warm air to wash your hands isn't hot enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster on the body temperature (37 °C).
Hot water is more effective than cold water in reducing the natural oil that keeps moisture and bacteria alive.
However, turning back with the confidence of many, scientific studies show that the use of hot water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in hand.
Hand movements or antiseptics are clean-up agents that are not based on water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand washing agents were non-water-based alcoholics (also known as alcohol-based dealers, antisectic dealers, or hand surgeons).
Most of this clean-up agent is based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, formed together with such digital materials as Carbomer (acrylate polymer) as a gel or with a mixture such as glycerin as salt or powder to be easily used and to reduce the effect on alcohol reduction.
Adding hydrogen peroxide encer increases antimicrobial activity further. Hand movements containing at least 60-95% of alcohol are effective fungal killers.
Alcohol abuse kills bacteria, drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinavirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol abuse, which includes 70% of alcohol, kills 99.97% (log loss 3.5, compared to 35 decibels) of the bacteria in the hands of 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.99% (log loss of 4 to 5) of the bacteria in the hands of 1 minute after use. The most effective hand attacks against the bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based manipulation almost entirely does not work against the virus type norovirus (or norwalk), the most common cause of gastroenteritis. Antiseptics or alcohol in numbers should be used to isolate or close both hands completely.
The front and back of both hands as well as on the left and the end of all hands is stretched about 30 seconds to the heat, soda, or iron.
The end of the hand should also be washed well by touching it in two hands. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention is more encouraging to wash your hands when you have to wash your hands, especially when your hands look dirty.
Increase the use of the agency for the use of the agency as a result of the slow use and rapid killing activities against the microorganism; however, the agency should not be used as a substitute for the right hand-cuff, except for soap and water not prepared.
The use of alcohol-based handwashing can often cause severe skin, unless emolien and/or skin swelling is added to the formula.
The effect of reducing alcohol can be cured or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolien to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based handwashing that contains emoleen causes irritability and swelling of the skin much lower than soap and antimicrobial dehydration.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to adhesives in the alcoholic’s fingernails rarely occur.
A lower concentration resulting from contact dermatitis that interferes with the presence of this product is compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents do not wash their hands from organic matter, but only infect them.
For this reason, the washers do not have any effect on the soap and water in preventing many pathogens from preaching because the pathogens are still in their hands.
The reality of alcohol abuse depends greatly on its content and formulation, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol consumption.
Recently, the formula used by benzalconium chloride has been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, not as alcohol, which is proved to be weak after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects.
Many in the community struggle with low self - worth, with no choice but to buy fruit or other things that they can afford.
Water or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective is soap.
One of the concerns is, if consumed with microorganisms, land or bugs may increase the spread of disease by slightly reducing it.
Like soap, soap is also an agent of disinfection because, if contact with water, it will form alkali root.
WHO recommends things and waste as alternative soap when soap is not prepared.
The technique cleans the right hand based on the recommendations of the U.S. Center for Disease Control to prevent the spread of disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot water or with cold water.
It is recommended that water be used for the purpose of being contaminated, but it does not seem to affect the air.
Wash your hands with soap with lots of soap, including the back of your hand, in your hands, and under my neck.
The soap rises from the skin, and the study shows that people who wash their hands are more alike when using soap than when using water.
At least for 20 seconds.
Insects create fat, which helps to eliminate skin cancers, and in the long run eliminates more oxygen.
Speak all the way down under the water.
Swimming in a bag can make hands contaminant again.
Reduce with severe pain or let go of air.
The most common areas are apples, roots, areas between hands, and under my neck.
I'm doing my best, and I'm gonna keep my micro-organisms.
Loneliness is often recommended to keep your hands from shaking; it can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low quality options can be made to facilitate wash hands when running water and/or soap is not available, for example, to extract water from well-dwelled or bottled and/or to use water, if necessary, in the developing country. In situations where water flows are limited (such as school or heating areas in developing countries), there are solutions to water-heat, such as "type-tap", and other low-quality choices.
Tippy kera is a simple technology that uses a water bottle covered with a rope, a towel operated by the foot to carry some water into the hands, and a rope.
Effective hand fear is an important part of the process of hand washing, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand washing in the public toilet.
More and more research shows that the paper sheet is much cleaner compared to the electric current found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and was conducted by the European news industry Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of the paper’s cleanness, the warm air pressure, and the more modern windscreening.
After cleaning and washing hands with warm air, the total number of bacteria was found to increase 194% in manuals and 254% in handcuffs.
Reinforced with jet air currents cause 42% of the total number of rat-ray bacteria in the manuals and 15% of the armpits.
After cleaning and washing hands with paper sheet, the total number of bacteria decreased by 76% in manuals and 77% in manuals.Ilmunan also conducted a test to determine the potential of bone contamination on other toilet users and the environment of toilets as a result of each type of cooling method.
The jet air carriers, which release air from units with speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), are capable of absorbing microorganisms from hand and unit and capable of testing other toilets and toilet environments up to 2 meters long.
The use of hot air-hands spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the cold.
In 2005, TÜV’s study of Product und Umwelt, a study conducted by TÜV, showed no sign of a significant microorganism.
After hand washing, the following changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
A number of hand tools have been developed, and hand tools have been compared to clay tablets.
Washing hands by using a hand-tip pen is an alternative for a long time without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand washing should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was held long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effect (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital.
There are electronic devices that provide backups to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection dropped with the use of this device.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in a large quantity of or glass to cook and touch each piece of hand.
The hands must be rubbed together with each other's hands together.
If there's a hole in the bottom of the pit, the bullet can be used to remove it.
Since copper can withstand in water that is in hand, it needs to be mixed together and coated with clean lead.
After a storm, the paper sheet was used to kill the water tank (and open the door out if necessary).
This action prevents the recontamination of the hand from the surface.
The purpose of washing hands in health care is to eliminate pathogen microorganisms and avoid their addictions.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that fewer hand washing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical communities, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to wash their hands before touching patients to develop microorganisms.
One study showed that washing the right hands and the other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood-related respiratory infection to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has issued a schedule that shows the standard of drying hands and gloves in the health sector.
Also on the Web site for public comments can be found on WHO’s clean hands.
Relevant visits were made by Whitby et al.
The commercial system could be used to justify and validate the cleansing of the hands if evidence of necessity is needed.
The World Health Organization has "Five Hours" to wash your hands:
after being exposed to blood/body clots.
before the aesthetics, and
After patient treatment, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (the "medicine" or "antimicroba") works to kill handcuffs.
The function to kill it may be desired before it is done or in situations where an antibiotic-containing organism is very serious. For 'minggosok' to perform an operation before it is too late, it is necessary to remove and kill a wound that can be healed without touching, chlorhexin or iodium, sterile lap to wash your hands after cleaning, and steril pressure to inject and other sterile instruments to clean up your skin.

This procedure is intended to wash your hands and hands down to your neck, usually 2-6 minutes.
The length of time, 10 minutes, is not required.
When washing, the water in the hands of the lower hand must be prevented from turning back to the hand.
After the washing of the hands, the hands were cut off with steel hooks and leather straps.
To reduce the effectiveness of our ministry, it is better to wash our hands before and after using a handshake.
For the control of staphylococcal infection in the hospital, it was found that the biggest benefit was to clean hands from the first 20% of the cleaning, and that the additional benefits received were very little when the clearance frequency increased by 35%.
Washing with soap is usually more than three times the proportion of infectious diseases to food compared to antibacterial soap. The comparison between mixing hands with alcohol-based syringes and washing hands with antibacterial soap every 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based users reduce the contamination of the bacteria 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based injections to reduce the influence of A H1N1 and Clostridium-discharged scans. Interventions to improve the healing of the hands in health care may involve education for staff on hand washing, increased the availability of alcohol-based hand-to-hand care, and written reminders and letters to the staff.
More research is needed to find the most effective interventions in various health - care systems.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a fundamental means of getting rich to good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or cleaning facilities in the homes, schools, and workplace makes it difficult for us to obtain the basic necessities of life.
For example, in most parts of West Africa, a hand mill near a private toilet or a public toilet is not available, even though there are few options for making a quick washroom.
In any case, the low level of hand washing can also occur because of a habit that has been established and not because of a lack of soap or water.
Washing and washing hands with soap can improve your judgment, increase your awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and result in long - term changes in people’s behavior.
In order to walk effectively, we need monitoring and evaluation.
A systematic survey of 70 studies found that the establishment of an effective community in raising handcuffs in the LMIC, while the campaign of social illness is not effective. One example of the school's fingernails is the "Three Stars" by UNICEF which motivates schools to take simple steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other clean conditions.
When the minimum standard is reached, school can move from one star to the last three stars.
Building a place for hand washing can be part of a hand washing campaign that is used to reduce the disease and death of children.
The Day of Cleaning the World’s Hand is another example of the campaign of increasing awareness that seeks to achieve the purpose of change in behavior. The impact of the 2019-2020 Korean virus virus has been encouraged by UNICEF's encouragement to wear a clean hand.
Some studies examined the effect of money washing hands generally in countries are developing in relation to the prevention of Life-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the age at which the disease occurs.
One survey showed that encouraging hand drying with soap meant significantly more expensive water intervention and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in arrears, such as a new mother born or a wounded soldier in a hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two hand sanitizers: a Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who works in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, in England.
At that time, many still believe that the infection is caused by a bout of dust called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980 ’ s, the release of food and infection related to health care made the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent infection.
The 2009 flu epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increase the incidence in many countries will be important to wash your hands with soap to protect yourself from these diseases.
For example, "Technique cleans the right hand" posters are placed on the side of the toilet in public toilets and on the kitchen and airport toilets in Germany.
The word "screaming hands" means saying that someone's willingness to take responsibility for something or to join in something.
That statement comes from the Bible book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate cut off his hands in favor of Jesus Christ, but it has become widely used in the English community.
In Shakespeare's career, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash his hands constantly to clean up the imagener's nose; the act that showed his guilt for the evil he did and because he had forced his husband to do it.
It has also been noted that, after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, the addicts often wash their hands more often and the tendon appreciates the tools themselves.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation have less chance of being involved in the "cleaning" compensation action, such as voluntary.
Religion commands hand washing for the purpose of cleansing and symbolism. The cleansing of the symbolic hands, which use water, but without a covering to wash the hands, is part of the ritual washing of hands in many religions, including the Faith of Baha'í, Hindu, Jewish belief and the practice of fasting in Judaism, the Lavabo in Christianity, and the Wudhu in Islam. Religion also commands the washing of hands for cleansing, especially after certain actions.
Hindus, Jews, and Islam were responsible for the use of toilets.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam have been entrusted with the responsibility of washing hands before and after meals.
Workspace risk control for COVID-19
The risk management of the workplace for COVID-19 is a health and occupational health methodology for the use of the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The correct risk management at the workplace depends on the workplace and work, based on the risk assessment of radiation sources, the level of disease in society, and the risk factors for each worker who might be subjected to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Health (OSHA) of the United States, low-risk jobs have minimal working contacts with the public and other employees; for this work, the promotion of basic infection prevention, including washing hands, causing workers to live at home when they are ill, with the aim of ending, and doing cleaning and cleaning work on a regular basis.
The risk of injury is involved in a job that requires close or frequent contact with people who are not known or expected to suffer COVID-19, but may be affected by an accident in an international society or travel.
This group includes workers who have contacts with general public, such as at school, the working environment with the high population, and high volume travel.
The risk management of this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air supply, protection against pollution, and self-defense protection equipment when facing COVID-19.
OSHA considers the health and body room of those who are known or expected to suffer from COVID-19 to be high-risk, which increases the risk of being very high if the worker performs aerosol performance procedure, or takes or handle the species of, known or expected to suffer COVID-19.
The appropriate risk control for the worker includes technical control, such as a negative ventilation room, and a self - protective device appropriate to the job.
The COVID-19 can have a few shots at work.
Employees may not come to work because of sickness, the need to take care of others, or the fear of flying.
Trade pools can change, well in what kind of goods are requested or how to get these things (such as out-of- hours, by means of mail, or by mail).
Finally, shipments of goods from the very affected geographical area of COVID-19 can be interrupted.
The article considers the risks associated with various workplaces and jobs, including savings resources, risk factors arising from home and community care, as well as individual risk factors, such as ageing or chronic medical conditions.
The articles also provide practical suggestions on how we can best cope with these challenges and how to avoid situations that could cause us to slow down.
Preparations and plans for the removal of infectious diseases may be followed by recommendations for national or subregional purposes.
The aim of the media is to reduce tension among staff, protect people at higher risk for ill health complications, maintain business operations, and minimize the negative effects on other entities on the market.
The spread of disease in the business community has been a major factor.
The risk of being infected with dangerous diseases is reduced by the amount of work that is used in health and health at work to reduce the risk of infection.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, administrative control, and the last protective device.
Technical control involves insulating employees from work-related risks without relying on the work behaviour and making it the most expensive solution to be put on.
Administrative management is a change in how a worker or employer reacts to the needs of his or her employees.
Self - defense (APD) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative control, but it can help to prevent certain accidents.
All APDs should be selected on the basis of risks to the work, properly installed as they are (invented, respiratory), consistently and properly used, tested, monitored, and replaced on a regular basis, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and properly stored or removed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Health (OSHA) of the United States, low-risk jobs have minimal employment contacts with the public and other employees.
The ranges of basic infection prevention recommended for all workplaces include frequent washing hands together, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, including covering stones and sand, preparing nets and sand, preparing work from distance or distance work with time to arrive, if necessary, informing workers not to use other tools and equipment, and doing cleaning and cleaning work regularly.
The quick and insulating identification of potential individuals is an important step in protecting employees, employers, employees, and others at work.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that those who have acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from dementia, signs of dengue, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of dentists or any other antipsychotic medicines, and that the diagnosis of the disease be flexible so that they allow them to stay at home to care for the sick family members, and that the staff know about this.
According to the OSHA, insurance work is covering a job that requires close contact or often within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not known or expected to suffer COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-COV-2 because of an accident in the community around the place of business, or because a new person makes an international trip to a place with an extensive COVID-19 landing.
This group includes workers who have contacts with public societies such as school, community work with high population, and high volume rates. Technical controls for this group and high risk groups include high-level air efficiency filters, increase ventilation, increase physical wears such as light-duty plastics, and establish windows for waste management. The administrative control for this group and the high-level task group combines difficult jobs with virtual communications, make it work with a common environment, avoids high-frequency air traffic, reduces air pollution, improves ventilation, improves the physical wearer such as clean-outs, and maintains windows for waste management.
Workers in this risk group don't need respiratorys.
If a person falls sick on a plane, the proper control to protect the worker and other passengers involves separating the person from another person by six feet [6 m] long, showing a cabin to care for the sick, and offering a mask to the patient or asking him to close his mouth and nose when he is stoned or washed.
The cabin should wear a medical belt once in a while when caring for a sick passenger or touching a body or surface that is potentially contaminated and possibly other protective equipment if the patient is suffering from smoke, continuous stones, or breathing problems.
For commercial services, including passenger ships and other crews, the risk of carrying on a journey when sick, insulating themselves, and informing medical centres on the ship immediately if a person has an accident or other injury occurs on the ship.
Ideally, medical advances are carried out in the homes of people who have been isolated. As a result of public witnessing, for school and child training facilities, CDC recommends short-term shelters to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in school building.
If there are social exclusions at a minimum level until now, the social exclusion strategy can be implemented, which includes: canceling visits to farms, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, class of singing, or eating at a café, increasing the distance between the table, the time of arrival and relaxing, limiting non-sensitious events, and using different health offices for children with flu-like violence.
If there is a high degree in local society, on the side of the social exclusion strategy, extension of school leavers can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform day-to-day work, health risks are directly considered to be low by CDC.
The law enforcement officer who should contact the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is recommended to follow the same protocol as the emergency medical technology, including the proper use of self-defence tools.
If close contacts take place during the arrest, the worker must clean up and clean up the fuel and equipment before use of the re-use by using a vacuum cleaner or a toilet and follow the standard operating procedure to control and remove APD files and to control and clean the trash.
OSHA considers certain health and body rooms to be of high or very high risk.
High-risk jobs include health care supplies, support, laboratories, and medical transport forces compared to patients known or expected to be COVID-19.
This work has become a very high risk if aerosol performance procedure is carried out by the worker, or takes or handle the specifics of, a patient known or expected to be COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubates, bone induction procedures, bronchoscopic, some procedures and diagnosis, or invasive species.
The work of high-risk bedrooms involves the work involved in preparing the body of a person known or suspected of being a COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes a very high risk if the worker performs an autopsy. The additional technical control for this risk group includes an insulation room for patients known or expected to be COVID-19, including when the aerosol performance procedure is carried out.
In some health - care clinics and mental - health clinics, negative stress can be particularly severe.
Specimen must be treated with the prevention of the Level of Biosafety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients come to a different waiting room if they are expected to be COVID-19. In addition to the APD, OSHA recommends respiratorys for those who work within 6 feet of known or expected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and those who perform aerosol performance procedures.
In the United States, respiratory surgeons for N95 filter-like NIOSH or better should be used in the context of written and understandable weapons protection programs that include repair tests, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respiratory can provide greater protection and improve working conditions. WHO does not recommend the entire skin or coverall because COVID-19 is an infectious disease and is not spread through the body.
WHO's just recommending a mask for a screen agent at the entrance point.
For people taking weapons, surveillance, or accompanying COVID-19 patients without aerosol performance procedure, WHO recommends masks, protective caps, or facial features, shoes, and handshakes.
If the aerosol performance procedure is performed, the mask is replaced by N95 or FFP2.
Bearing in mind that APD does not cover all over the world, WHO recommends neglecting APD's needs through long-term medical services, physical discharges such as an eye-opening window, with only those involved in immediate treatment can enter the patient's COVID-19 room, use only APD needed for certain tasks, continue using the same respiratorys without allowing it to treat many patients with the same diagnosis, to monitor and coordinate the APD's network, and not to encourage the use of masks for people without delay.

BARIS SUBJEK: [Covit-19] To prepare the burden and prepare the future
SONGS TO BE USED: 14 March 2020, 00:24
LIST: CC0: No rights protected
We see ourselves in a very unusual situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes it clear how human beings are global and responsible that we have each other.
We've never had the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, work together, and the development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendships and interests that we have witnessed among all our coworkers through e - mails, calls, and chats are an extraordinary skill that is unique to people, which we have been quite fortunate to work with.
My gratitude and pride don't make it possible to call you back to work.
The following week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of what it means for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how this is a powerful symbol for this important source of energy to keep ready for all.
Your job allows this to happen, whether you make sure that this site is still running, helps to pay our friends, or helps to protect our community security.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially now.
This is a time when not only is the work we do but the way we do it will make the world a better place.
Since this mission is important and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the teams met last night to discuss our appointment and schedule for a few days and months coming.
In that discussion, we considered what we thought was the right answer to the challenges we faced and the best way to keep our organization going.
We were eager to eliminate the pressure and support our mission for a long time.
If you need to reduce the work schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our day - to - day hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted right now, and whether you need to care for the loved ones, pay for the needs of the tree, or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We don't waste your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should not be said, but we do.
There is no need for medical treatment or PTO, sufficient information about your manager and your team's help to review the calendar and schedules to ensure that key features of the work can be resolved.
(If you are diagnosed positively suffering COVID-19, hope to know Bryan in the T&C Ops so that T&C can help with your situation and ensure that you get the proper attention from the manager).
The friends who pay the hour's pay will be paid in full.
We told her, and we told her again, to respect our appointment with the contractors and the clock - based staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their secular work, which is usually the case with normal secular work.
This is especially true if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use jobs as an opportunity to put material things ahead of spiritual pursuits.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to do and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some jobs that must be kept in order.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and DPA teams, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all departments to examine our current goals and get our focus on supporting what's essential to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us. We're just going to focus on the most important project.
Relaxing now will be all right for the future.
We didn't plan to "work the left behind" after this sentence passed.
You will not be expected to work secularly to fill out time that is not realistic right now.
We realize that the situation changes and will try to set new targets and lines if needed.
What About APP?
In order to adjust to the new reality and the expected working hours of the day, we intend to adjust the time line for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Springs.
Our goal is to encourage the 2019-2020 agenda that allows more time to make appointments so that servants can give priority to important work, self-care, and the care of the loved ones, as well as harmonizing their needs or wanting to work with the schedule less for a few weeks to come.
The current trend is significantly reduced by the decline in the work force and the pressures of the current plan throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the House next week and inform the delegation and the team in the next step as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you for the AP team for your leadership in this regard.
Status, paper, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our partners based on SF might have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of concern, we worked for a clean-up antivirus to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use antiviral radiation in hospitals to infect every surface, lungs, and liver that passes through our soil.
The builders used their own safety protocol using a product that supports their survival.
We're glad that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all staff members based on DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a remote office, running with the direction shared by San Francisco.
As noted by some of our brothers who live in the United States, we are discussing the possibility of moving to Brooklyn to serve where there is a greater need.
This discussion will continue, but it may take time.
Some of our friends work from far away for the first time.
Our longtime coworkers have long recognized that it may need to be adjusted and they want to give you advice:
The battery is approaching at least one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to share them for a few days.
Identify clearly, make an appointment, and send literature beforehand.
Make video as default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connections.
Show the director how to facilitate each other’s affairs, how to provide for the needs of the family, and how to provide for the needs of the family.
Send email to technical support if you need a secure headset.
Use your health compensation to buy little food.
Join the #remoties in Slack to talk to the team about shared work
The SDM Operation team is looking for a web-based ergonomic platform to support the expansion of the work that has been distributed throughout the Earth.
Last week we asked all the recipients of community news to cancel a public event called Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO said the ban was over.
We let them know that we understand our request for settlement and other terminations can make them unable to complete the agreed settlement and that no one will be given a patent because they have to mark or modify this agreement.
This coming week we will continue with additional guidance on Wikimania and the regional community conferences and other thematics.
In general, feelings from the whole global community seem to be the sad result of this confusion, but once it's easy to focus on the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, well on Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is trying to prepare space in Meta-Wiki to provide room for the community to watch and follow our communication with them.
Keep connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Kamis coming, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff summary.
We're going to use this time to share additional equations, answer your questions, and spend time together.
We're together in this situation and we want to help our own.
Meanwhile, you can continue to receive information from this email and all other essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
The CRT will continue to spread this area and ensure that all information is in one place.
We also try to keep regular communications with staff living in the countries that are currently being significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, basic work, or problems about recreation, or if you need help, do not hesitate to give up and work together with the CRT.
We're here to help provide support and to be a link to the needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Juden, Director of the Global SDM Operation International.
None of these changes are viewed as a defeat for our work and our duty.
Rather, this change is a recognition that, at present, our work and our responsibilities may need to be adjusted in a way that we have never done before.
This change is the steps that we believe are important to support one another in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need to move, and provide the world of services they trust.
The work we've planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, this is the time to support one another and to create a room for important work that will take place within a few weeks and perhaps months.
We need all you to create it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work best when necessary.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Enzim angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell (cell membrane) in dust, artery, heart, knee, and mouth.
ACE2 has an anti-angiotensin reverse activity (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II levels and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising target for cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also works as an entry point in the cell for several Coronaviruses.
ACE2 human version is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is angiotensin reverse enzyme that contains metalluenism that is placed on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has M2 peptidase terminal-N and transporter domains as well as amino renal collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a protein membrane of the individual type I, with active domains that are enzymely exposed to the cell surfaces of the lungs and other networks.
ACE2 extra domains are separated from transmembran domains by other enzymes, known as sheddaze, and processed proteins that are released into the blood vessels and eventually dextres into the urine.
ACE2 is in large parts of the body: ACE2 is placed on the membrane of the brain especially with type II parous alveolar cells, small-use enteroritis, endothelial and vein endocrine cells, and cells of the arterial bone in the larger part of the body.
The MRNA ACE2 expression is also found in the serebral, striatum, hypothalamus, and bone marrow.
The main ACE2 function is as an ACE developer.
ACE medicates angiotensin I hormone as angiotensin II vasconstrictive.
Finally, ACE2 reduces the amino phenylalanine terminal carboxylate from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis becomes angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also eliminate a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, appylin, neurotensin, dinofin A, and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the transit of the transporter's asymno net SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembran protein, ACE2 function as the primary entry point in the cell for several coronaviruses, which include HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-COV-2 virus) and SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19-based virus).
More specifically, the involvement of S1 protein in Spike or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface causes endotosis and transfer of virus and enzyme into the endosomal in the cell.
This virus introduction process also requires primary protein S by TMPRSS2 protease series, which is currently being identified as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothetical that ACE2 in cells may help to fight infection.
However, many professional and regulatory authorities recommend that the ACE and ARB inhibitors be continued.
A systematic and metaanalysis survey, published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors leads to 34% increase in pneumonia risk compared to control."
Further, "use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients with higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of an ACE inhibitor is also associated with the related pneumonia mortality rate, although the result is less than the overall risk of pneumonia."
ACE2 recombinant human (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute renal failure, and it appears to increase renal haemodynamics and oxygen content in baby babies with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipoplasagrida.
When rhACE2 is shared with humans about 10 hours with work hours for 30 minutes, except for the duration of 24 hours.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a medicine that promises patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or to disease with angiotensin II in an increase in blood circulation. The rhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in a clinical trial for acute respiratory syndrome.
b'COVID-19'Application is an application of a single device designed to help a contact plan to reverse the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, that is, the process identifying the person ("kontak") who may have made contact with the infected person.
Many applications have been developed or corrected, which has been supported by government officials in some areas and jurisdictions.
Some of the tools used to build contacts have been developed.
The issue of privacy is raised, especially with regard to systems based on the location of the application user geographically.
Alternatives that do not take too much privacy include using Bluetooth signals to print the user's presence with other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support Bluetooth-based applications directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In Tiongkok, the Tiongkok government, together with Aragawa, has published applications that allow people to check whether they have been contacted with the COVID-19 disease.
This application was used in over 200 cities of Tiongkok. In Singapore, it is used as a TraceTogether application.
This application was developed by the local IT community, written as an open source and will be distributed to the government. North Macedonia destroyed "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track attacks on people who are potentially infected and respond quickly to health care authorities.
This application is being developed by the Communications and Technology and Health.
Until April 14, 2020, these applications still await the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12th, the government said that the contact programming applications are in progress and will be ready for publication within a few weeks. Such applications are planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore applications and BlueTrace protocol. Russia is identifying the geoffencing applications for the COVID-19 terdiagnosian patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that might arise on the application-based system, which include false positives and possibly less effective if data taken limited to only a small part of the population.
In order to overcome the concerns about the spreading of "koronavirus" applications that are harmful or dangerous, Apple sets limits on the kind of organization that can add the related coronavirus applications to the App Store, i.e. limit only to "resim" organisations or those with good reputation.
Google and Amazon use similar endings.
Private supporters suggested their concern about the involvement of mass surveillance in the use of the Coronavirus applications, particularly on whether the surveillance infrastructure that is made to deal with the Coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements that limit such surveillance.
The organization stated eight conditions on the government project:
surveillance must be "adjusted, necessary, and proportionate";
the need for maintenance and surveillance must have the sun’s coolest class;
the use of data must be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
data security and anonymity must be protected and proven on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid becoming more discriminated against and marginalized;
Each data sharing with third parties must be defined in the laws;
There must be protection against abuses and the right of citizens to respond to abuses;
participation means all "relevant interests" required, including public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issued a review list.
The Google/Apple article recommended means to deal with the monitoring problem by removing the scans from the device operating system after it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use network-based, non-applications, thus reducing the effectiveness and ability of anti-locking applications.
In Israel, a basic network of races was established.
A network-based solution that has access to the location data has a potential for meaningful privacy issues.
However, not all systems with the central server need to access personal data; some privacy systems have been created and use the central server only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, non-application systems are used to make contact announcements.
As a result of the use of special applications, the system collects crash information from various sources, includes general device crash data and card transaction data, and combines this information to produce information through a text message to those who have the potential for infection.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also makes this location information available to the public, which is permitted with extensive changes to the privacy laws after the fall of the MSRS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using a broken system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, details have not yet been published.
A contact plan that protects privacy is an advanced concept, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a team of experts working on a private network solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user’s presence with other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is an effort to coordinate a centralised and decentralised location, and not a single protocol. The focused protocol includes the DP-PPT/DP-3T Privacy Protection Protocol (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporal Contact Number (TCN, previously referred to as Contact Event Number, CEN), the Protocol and Sensitive Privacy Mechanism (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, the personal data that can be identified never leave the device, and all matches are on the device.
The MIT Media Lab's private group developed SafePaths, a platform to use technology that protects privacy when collecting and using sites or user interface data to track COVID-19 sermons.
This is based on a study from the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Managing Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020.Other features are the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops private technology and is also founded in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses a secure device technology to allow users to share their location and sensitive health data with other users and employees without sacrificing their privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN coalition was established by a group of groups that had the same signing and are a very high-level protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for programming and warning applications, which is the main aspect of reaching wide acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by the government's official applications as a source of openness.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the Android and iOS platform management company, announced initiatives for communication, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-protected cryptography.
They also publicize the technical specifications used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be destroyed in three stages:
A tool to allow governments to make official applications of the Coronavirus surveillance that protect privacy
The integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple plans to deal with the problem of data recovery and surveillance continue with initial distribution of the system through the transmission of the operating system, and then remove it in the same way after the threat passes.
b'Reposit the medicine (also called a new purpose, new profile, or new work on medicine or treatment) is the use of the medicine that has been approved for the purpose of new treatment, i.e. for disease or medical conditions that differ from the original purpose of medical development.
This route is the research path currently being undertaken to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research guidelines include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be the target of medicine, each protein has several linkage sites.
An analysis of the linkage sites can be the basis for an effective antiviral drug development project against COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important protein target SARS-CoV-2 is protease similar to papain, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helikase, S protein, and ADP rifosophatase.
Hussein A A, et al studied several candidates' strengths that were then optimised and analysed with the most widely accepted medicine and had the highest tendency to speed up the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potentials in the practice study to be recommended in clinical studies.

Governor New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that a test of chloroculin and hydrochloriculin in New York would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochloriculin sulphate and phosphate based on the Authority for the Use of Darurat (USA).
This treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised on the basis of the USA only as experimental treatment for the use of rats in any patient, but cannot be received in the clinical trial.
CDC says that "use, dose, or hydrochloriculin duration for prophylaxis or SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment" has not been established.
The doctor said they used that medicine when "no other choice."
A Turkish team of researchers in Istanbul is doing a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with bone, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Great studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
THE New Langone Medical School is trying to test safety and the safety of hydrochloriculin prevention.
Tingkok's clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir is proven to be "effectively effective".
Thirty - five patients in Shenzhen had a negative effect on the median of 4 days, whereas the duration of the illness was 11 days for 45 patients who did not accept the medicine.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipyravir and half were given imifenovir.
The Italian Federation of Pharmacy reminds the public that there is little evidence to support this medicine and too much here.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy that medicine from Japan for preparation and use the military to send it to a university hospital, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made a donation to the Trup government on the purchase of this medicine, which may be less effective in cases of serious illness with a virus that has multiplied.
This medicine may not be safe if it is used by pregnant mothers or those who are trying to contain it.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no significant benefits".
This medicinal product is designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by inserting protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicine to find a substance that will be associated with SARS-CoV-2.There is criticism in scientific societies about the supply of energy to fix the drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in an international solidarity test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a cure for Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir has in vitro antivirus activities against some philosos, pneumos, paramicso, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutatis mutandis that can cause more disease and transmission.
Some initial studies of the pauji-test show that remdesivir may have a high genetic defense against resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, including two clinical trials performed by the University of Cleveland Hospital, one for people with illness, and another for those with severe diseases.
There are three clinical trials that are undergoing intravenous vitamin C for those treated with severe COVID-19 disease, namely two controlled placebos (Tiongkok, Canada) and one uncontrollable (Italy).
New York State began testing for azitromysin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Health and Global Medicines Centre (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (cyclosonide) Teijin, inhalation corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of new pharmacolytic Coronavirus infection.
For a type of angiotensin reverse enzyme 2, Phase II test is going on with 200 patients who will be recruited from the worst cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to learn about the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of coloxisin in reducing inflammation and renal complications in patients suffering from COVID-19 cancer.
The study, called COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had a mild fever that did not require adequate care.
A woman who is pregnant or breast - feeding or who does not use effective contraception is not satisfied.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin had a low molecular level that was used to treat patients so that the Italian Medicines Department had to issue a complaint about its use.
A multi-posted study of 300 patients who studied the use of enoxaparin sodium at the dose of prophylactic and therapeutic data was published in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, many scientific attention has been focused on providing new medical targets for approved antiviral drugs, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Tiongkok version 7
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Tiongkok dose of 7
Some antibiotics identified are potential as a medicine that can be given new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor IL-6): agreed by Tiongkok.
In addition, trials were also carried out in Italy and Tiongkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine that completes clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to improve the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, this infectious virus would not be available for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in the phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A global news campaign in 2020, involving investments and major research activities to promote vaccines.
Many organizations use genome published to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative announced in April that the thing to be observed in developing vaccines was speeding up, production capacity, preaching on the required scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI’s expert reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during the early 2020s to make effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform objective of the advanced phase I security study, including:
nuclear ass (DNA and RNA) (Fase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
vector virus (Fase I growth and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, vector adenvirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, the total 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milk Institute), and 37 others were published, but with little public information available ( deemed to be in planning or planning).
A phase I-II test performed a safety test and initial immunogenicity test, usually performed on a random, controlled placebo, and in some places, with a more accurate effective dose determination.
Phase III test usually involves more than one percent, including a control group, and tests on the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while assessing the side effects on the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in the human evaluation (particularly in the "praklinis") research.

On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported a partial development similar to that of the Coronavirus with partial involvement of Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine is being studied in the laboratory, with a test on humans scheduled for July or August 2020.
At the outset, The Guardian reported that President A.S., Donald Trump, had offered "a large amount of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which the German government interpreted.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop mRNA-based vaccines together.

On April 2, 2020, researchers at the PittCoVacc University Faculty of Medicine reported on the vaccine test, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, at the tick; they said that "MNA that gives sub-subunit S1 SARS-COV-2 introduces a potent antigen-specific antidote response that began to appear 2 weeks after immunity."
On April 16, 2020, in Canada, the University of Waterloo Farms has announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential candidate.
Using bacteriophog, DNA is designed to apply in human bacteria to produce harmless cirrhosis particles, which can induce immune systems to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, government, industry, and three U.S. universities collected power sources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with the source of adverts from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
That means that these vaccines can benefit from the disease they are preventing.
A further test in Australia attempted to track 4,170 health officials.
There may be no safe or effective vaccines in the developing world.
Early studies to examine the authenticity of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenics, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primate, show that protection steps are needed to achieve the level of biological health 3 in the management of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard health procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested in human form.
By 2020, there was no cure or vaccine for SARS that proved to be safe and effective for humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new medicines to treat SARS is a priority for governments and social health institutions worldwide. In addition, the vaccines that have been shown for MERS have not yet been found.
When MERS become prevalidated, confidence-based SARS research can be a useful model for developing vaccines and therapy for the infection of MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, there was one METS vaccine (the DNA database) that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines were in process, all of which were virus vector vaccines, two adenovivirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media postaging the conspiracy theory that claims virus back to COVID-19 has previously been known and that vaccines have been prepared.
The patents established by the various social media posts refer to the patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus glaucoma, such as SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a manic disease caused by the Coronavirus syndrome of acute weaponization 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
A common cold, a cold, and even a breath.
Other diseases include obesity, brain pain, diabetes, constipation, loss of appetite, and kidney disease.
The time from sunset to sunset is about five days, but it can range from two to four in the next four days.
Although most cases are mild to moderate, some develop viral pneumonia and have failed to control the body’s immune system.
As of April 17, 2020, over 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, affecting more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568.000 people have recovered, especially when they have a close contact, often through small surgery or droplets produced through stones, urine, or speech.
Although it was produced when the breath was released, the droplets usually fell to the ground or to the surface and did not travel long distances.
A person can also be infected by touching a surface that is contaminated with the eyes, lips, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last for 72 hours.
This virus spreads very rapidly for the first three days after gestation, although the preaching may occur before pregnancy occurs and after the next stage of disease. The standard diagnostic method is with the response of the polymerase reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) in the nasopharyngeal system.
The benefits of the mask are encouraged by those who are suspected of being infected with the virus and those who take care of it.
Recommendations on the use of masks by different public authorities; some authorities recommend that they not use masks, some recommend their use, and others encourage their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local disease transmission has been reported in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
A person infected with a virus may experience flulike symptoms, such as fever, fever, fatigue, and nausea.
Injury including breathing difficulties, pain or injury in a continuous chest, swelling, difficulty in getting up, and face-to-face or sweating; medical treatment is immediately recommended if these events occur.
A weapon specially designed to attack, such as a snake, a snake, or a snake can be found, but it is rare.
Gastrointestinal disorders, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are common.
Some of the cases in Tiongkok were initially only with the clinical images of the liver and palpitation.
In some cases, disease can develop into pneumonia, stroke, and death.
This period is called the period of incubation.
Incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can break from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who have been infected will experience pregnancy within 11.5 days of infection, and the report shows that not all people who have been infected have experienced pregnancy.
The bearing of this uncanny in the container is not yet fully known; however, initial evidence indicates that they may have contributed to the preaching of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of unaccompanied infected people who are not yet known and are being addressed, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all cases remain confirmed without pregnancy during hospital care.
The Tingkok National Health Commission began to issue a case without a complaint in its case on April 1st; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) did not show a case in case of a trial.
Sputum and lubricant can carry the virus in a large scale.
Talk with ease and ease of voice and ease of voice are more likely to be compared to normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that unclosed stones could cause droplets to rise to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is not usually broadcast through the air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and the air collecters that are located on the floor outside the room produce a positive example for RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and heart attack (RJP), can cause the secret of the drug to become aerosol and spread through the air.
Although there is some concern that the virus can spread through the fesses, this risk is considered to be low. The virus is most likely to spread when a person reaches it; even though the preaching may occur before the attack occurs, it is a low risk.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person in general infected two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on the cardboard/card, up to three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and cardboard (AISI 304), and up to four hours on the 99% sheet.
However, this variety depends on the size and the quality of the plant and the heat.
The soap and detergene are also effective if used properly; the soap product reduces the weight of the virus protection, deactivation of the virus, and release it from skin and other surfaces.
Other ingredients, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, water samples are taken in the median for two days after the beginning of the autumn.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus level, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus level in the second day test.
Coronavirus acute drug syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute drug syndrome Coronavirus, which is first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the acute drug disease cluster in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus is on a coronavirus that's fighting in the world.
Outside of the human body, this virus is killed by a spouse's cousin, which destroys its guardianship. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the first SARS-CoV.
Paru is the most affected organ of the COVID-19 because the virus accesses angina cell through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzymes, which is the most common in type II parous alveolar cells.
This virus uses a particular glycoprotein, called "spike or anchovy" to connect to the ACE2 and enter the inhaler cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of the infected people treated in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more often in the form of severe diseases.
High cardiovascular disease rates are due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders during the development of disease, but acute myocardial infarction may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptor is highly high in the heart and is involved in the function of the heart.
Thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in COVID-19 infected patients in ICU and possibly associated with poor prognosis. Otopesy to those who died because of COVID-19 found an alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphoma infiltrate in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropical epithelial cell that expresses ACE2, patients with COVID-19 have severe systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, the T cell that suppresses GM-CSF pathogenics has been shown to interact with monosistic seizures that suppress IL-6 inflammators and poor renal pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Limphosic infiltrate has also been reported on the octopsis.
WHO has published a number of test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is the reaction of the polymerase transcriptic reverse-time (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on the basis of a method used by the nasopharynologist; however, it can also be used by an anesthesiologist or an ass.
The results usually last only a few hours until two days.
A blood test can be performed, but two blood samples must be taken for two weeks so that the outcome could be of short duration.
Tingkok's scientist is able to isolate this coronavirus and to alter its genetic sequence so that the laboratory worldwide can develop a polymerase response test (PCR) independently to detect the infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibodies test (which can detect active infections and if a person has previously infected) was in progress, but not much has been used.
Tingkok’s experience with this trial shows that he was concerned only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States agreed to the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. Diagnostics published by the University of Wuhan University of Zhongnan Hospital suggest a method for detecting infection based on clinical images and risk of epidemiology.
Major multilobar ground-glass oppositates with peripheral distribution, asymmetrics, and posterior distribution were found many at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominasi, crazi paving (seven years with variable alveolation), and consolidation can occur frequently in the development of disease.
Some data is available on the microscopic list and the pathology of COVID-19.
The main pathology finding in the ocean is:
Macroscopic: fluorescence, pericarditis, parus consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of pneumonia virus infection can treat:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumositis hyperplasia, large-like pneumositis, interstitial inflammation with lymphotic infiltrations, and a high level of hepatic cell clearance
severe pneumonia: adhesion of the alveolar (DAD) with adhesion of the alveolar.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the growth stage: exudation in alveolar and interstitial lung fibrosis
Blood: intravascular disemination (DIC); leukoirebroblast reaction
The dangers to reduce the risk of infection are to stay at home, to avoid many places, often to wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, to practice good hygiene, and to avoid touching eyes, noses, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with a tip when it is pressed or washed and recommending the use of parts in the syringe if the tip is not ready.
Hygiene’s right hand is restored after a stone or a stone has been blown up.
CDC recommends the use of the cover cover of coffee in public places, part of which limits people's independence. The social exclusion strategy aims to reduce contact with people infected with many, by shutting down schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
The closing ceremony also included at least six feet [6.8 m] or eight feet [1.8 m] long.
There is no known effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. While the vaccine is not yet available until early 2021, the main part of the treatment of COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemi peaks, which is known as "square kurva".
CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after toilets or when their hands appear dirty, before they eat, and after washing their teeth, stones, or salt.
Further CDC recommendations the use of alcoholic hand mills containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand mills are not available, WHO provides two formulas for local production.
In this formula, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help eliminate bacteria' track in alcohol; this is "not an active substance for hand-sepsis".
Glycerol is added as a vaccine.
People are treated with support, which can include breast - feeding, oxygen support, and other vital organs that are affected.
CDC recommends that those who suspect them carry a virus to wear a simple face mask.
Oxygenesis has been used to address the problem of bone failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Health care, hygiene, and nutrition are recommended to enhance mankind’s health.
Support management may be useful to those who have low levels of infection at the beginning of the infection. WHO and the National Health Commission Tiongkok have issued recommendations to deal with COVID-19 diseases that are not adequately monitored.
Intensive and poor management in the U.S. have recommended the treatment of various institutions as a source of free energy, i.e. IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For pregnancy, some medical forces prefer parasetamol (asaminofen) to be compared with ibuprofen for the first line use.
Prevention should be taken to minimize the risk of virus spread, especially in health care care when performing procedures that can produce aerosol, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For the health of the COVID-19 patient, CDC recommends that the person be placed in the Tular-Udara Insolation (IIR) Room (IIR) in addition to using standard prevention, contact prevention, and anti-traumatic prevention actions. CDC arranges for the use of self-defense protective devices (APD) during the attack.
The recommended device is APD, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection, and medical care. If it is available, the respiratory (not face mask) is better.
Respirator N95 was approved for industrial treatment, but the FDA authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the U.S.
N95 respiratorys are designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use not mentioned on the label.
If the mask is not ready, the CDC recommends using a mask or, as a last resort, a mask.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too serious until they need to ventilating or alternatively, but most of the cases are very serious.
The type of emergency support for people who have experienced COVID-19 respiratory failure is being actively addressed to those who are being monitored, and there is evidence that intubs can be avoided by high-end or biopositive air pressure.
It is not yet known whether one of these methods brings similar benefits to those who suffer from a chronic illness.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive ventilation, when prepared, because this technique limits the preaching of aerosol particles compared to high-favoured breast cancer. The more serious cases occur in adults (ages over 60 years, and especially those over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have adequate capital hospitals, which limit the capacity of the health system to deal with the number of cases of COVID-19 that are sufficiently bad to the extent necessary.
A study in Tingkok found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tiongkok, about 30% of COVID-19 patients who were finally treated were finally admitted to ICU.
Ventilation mechanisms become more complicated by acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occur in COVID-19 and oxygen becomes more difficult.
Ventilator capable of operating pressure control mode and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen transmission once the risk of tooth decay and the related ventilator-related pneumotoraks is underestimated.
A high PEEP may not be available on a long fan.
Studies on treatment potential began in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are being studied in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising one.
Although new medical developments may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or have been tested for further tests.
Antivirals can be tried in people with severe diseases.
Volunteers recommended WHO with and in a trial of efficacy and potential treatment safety. FDA has granted temporary authorisation for convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in a very or very or very dangerous case of life.
Convalence plasma has not yet been studied in a clinical study to confirm its safety and efficacy.
In February 2020, Tiongkok destroyed all its applications to treat this disease.
Users are requested to enter their name and ID number.
This application is able to detect 'links' using surveillance data so that it detects the potential for infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk potential is identified, the application not only recommends quarantine standing, but also informs local health officials. Analysis of data on the telephone, facial technology, telephone surveillance, and professional skills is used to track the infected and those who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security bodies to track the phone numbers of people who were suspected of being infected with coronaviruses.
It was used to carry out the quarantine and to protect the person who might have been infected.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed a telephone number to the German federal board, Robert Koch Institute, on a range of research and prevention programs.
Russia uses face-to-face technology to detect the corruption of its citizens.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by the telephone operator that "40% of people still move around".
The German government made a 48 - hour final decision by over 42,000 percent.
In addition, the Estonian President, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global effort to create a creative solution against the spread of cancer.
A person may experience stress caused by carantine, travel delays, side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, health degradation, stress, and economic stability is a perfect barrier to mental health and social health."
This disease can pass through the skin with little or no teeth, which may be the most common respiratory disease, such as a pellets.
The practice of breast - feeding usually lasts for two weeks, while those who suffer from chronic or chronic illness may need between three and six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still low. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs to cause pneumonia.
In the most vulnerable, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) which is due to a lack of weaponization, septic shock, or failure of the immune system.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and heart damage, kidney, and heart.
The incidence of blood clotting, especially the increase in prothrombin time, is estimated at 6% of patients treated with COVID-19, while the risk of renal function is seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 images show an increase in heart enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the period between pregnancy and death is ten days, with five days spent in the womb.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a period of seven days between pregnancy and death.
In a study of initial cases, the time of noon began from the beginning to the end of death is 14 days, with a line full of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, men had 2.8% deaths, while women had 1.7% deaths.
A study of postmortem paru histopathology shows that alveolar damage is caused by fibromyxoid exudation alone in both pairs.
Changes in the immune status of the virus have been observed in pneumositis.
The image appears to be an acute breath syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Tingkok National Health Commission, heart damage, with the rise of thrombonein or heart disease.
According to U.S. Maret's monthly data, 89% of those who were under surveillance had a drinking problem. The availability of medical and social resources in a region can also affect mortality.
The estimate of mortality from the variable conditions is due to the differences in the area, but also because of the methodological difficulties.
At least a brief divorce may result in the death of a loved one.
However, the fact that death is the result of a past case can mean that the death rate is now too low.
Perocok may have 1.4 times greater experience with poor COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death compared with those not smoking. There are concerns about how long this disease is.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some patients who were cured of the disease, and the diagnosis of lung cancer shows organ damage.
This can also cause intensification syndrome after resuscisive.
Until March 2020, it has not been known whether an infection has previously given effective and long - term immunity to those who recover from this disease.
Imunes may be considered to be used, if they see other coronavirus behavior, but they have been reported to be a COVID-19 case followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
This case is believed to be a serious infection, not a rebirth infection.
This virus is naturally expected to come from animals, through spreading infections.
The origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the preaching of the good news had reached almost every corner of the earth.
A study of 41 cases confirmed by the COVID-19 first, published in The Lancet in January 2020, revealed the first anniversary of the first anniversary of December 1, 2019.
WHO's official publication reported the first headline on December 8, 2019.
In general, a number of abortions are used to calculate the mortality rate.
This figure varies according to the region and frequency of time, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, choice of diets, time from the first time on, and the character of populations such as age, type of safety, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established the ICD-10-order U07.1 code for the death of SARS-CoV-2 who confirmed the laboratory and U07.2 for the death of COVID-19 diagnosed with clinical or epidemiology without confirmation of the laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to the University statistics of Johns Hopkins, the death rate for cases worldwide is 6.9% (155.822/2.240.191) for 17 April 2020.
Other claims include case fatality (CFR), which represents the percentage of terdiagnoses who died from certain diseases, and infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of those who died from terdiagnoses (terdiagnoses and non-teragnoses).
This statistics are not limited to time and are followed by a particular population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all people are infected with antibiotics, the immune system can provide information about the number of people infected.
At the Italian epicenter, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, this disease is spread through the Karnaval festival, which spread to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and probably not all deaths COVID-19 are classified as death COVID-19.
More and more, the German health system has not yet developed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as tested by blood donors.
69 people (0,004%) were confirmed dead because of COVID-19.
See the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher than men in studies conducted in Tiongkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is 50 years old, with a clear risk between new men and women not seen at 90 years of age.
In Tiongkok, death rates are 2.8% for adults and 1.7% for women.
There is no doubt that differences based on such factors can be resolved, but genetic factors and behavior may be factors.
Immunologists vary according to the type of safety, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, in younger women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of people infected were men and 72% died because of COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track the type of safety data for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that virus diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of health officials who have a higher degree of female safety, especially caregivers, and they have a higher chance of being infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghereyesus explained that CO is a prescription for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time identified: December 31, 2019.
This name is chosen to avoid references to certain geographical locations (e.g. Tiongkok), animal species, or groups of people, through international recommendations for prevention of stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus syndrome severe 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsibility virus" in public communication.
Good disease and bad virus is called koronavirus.
At the beginning of the campaign in Wuhan, Tiongkok, this virus and disease are called kronanavirus and Wuhan virus.
In January 2020, WHO recommends 2019-nCoV and acute 2019-nCov infectious diseases as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to the 2015 ruling that induces not to use the name of the place in the name of the disease and virus.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Because of the limited capacity of the standard feed chain, some digital products print health care materials such as naphtha and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital desperately needed a ventilator lock, and the nurse could not give it within the necessary time scale, a local company would turn around and print 100 needed locks in the evening.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 release, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and information exchanges about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the replication of the virus on babies, babies, and dogs.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved to treat this disease.
International studies on vaccines and COVID-19 are being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "SOLIDARITY Trial" to examine the effect of four of the most promising antiviral treatments.
The vaccine is not yet available, but various agencies are actively promoting the development of vaccines.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV were used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccinated vaccination strategies.
First of all, the researchers aim to produce a complete virus vaccine.
The use of that virus, good non-active or dead virus, aims to quickly eliminate human immune response to new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, this study focuses on S-spice protein that helps the virus to subsume an ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nuclear as vaccines (dNA or RNA vaccines, new vaccine techniques).
The experimental vaccine produced by this strategy should be tested to find out its safety and authenticity. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-hazardous genetic code derived from the virus that causes disease. Antibodies have been developed as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing in April 2020.
The seven tests test evaluate the treatment agreed upon for malaria, including four studies on hydrochloric acid or chloroculins.
The new antiviral drugs have formed a major part of the Tiongkok research, with nine phase III tests tested in resizvir in some countries with a slow rate of reporting at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic survey of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 is available. Some antiviral drugs that are being evaluated for treatment with COVID-19, which include resizvir, chlorokuin and hydrochloric acid, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir/ritonavir were combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there was a temporary proof of resizvir truth.
The clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with resizvir in the treatment of kidney failure.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the US, Tiongkok, and Italy. Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was registered in Tiongkok in February 2020 with initial results.
However, there is a need to make an honest appraisal of the facts.
The Korea Health Authority and Tiongkok recommend the use of chloroculins.
However, the Institute of Virology Wuhan, although recommending a daily dose of one gram of grams, notes that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be eliminated.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued authorisations for the use of chloroquine for hydrochloric acid and chloroculins for doctors who were treating COVID-19. The 7th edition of Tiongkok also distributed interferons, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
The initial data show that the high dose of ribavirin is required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro.
Nitazoxinda has been recommended for further in vivo study after showing SARS-CoV-2 distribution in low concentrations.Pensions show that initial priming against protein derived from the transmembran 2 (TMPRSS2) protease series is very important to enter SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The study of chlorokuins and hydroxycloquins with or without azitromysin has a large limit that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The complications of sitoquine can occur at the COVID-19 very closely.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquinin may have anti-sitokin properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment discourse by the Tingkok National Health Commission after a small study has been completed.
This medicine is undergoing phase 2 tests at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe diseases.
In combination with a serum fertilization test to identify sytokin cells, this medicine is intended to fight sytokin tumors, which are expected to cause death to some infected individuals.
In 2017, antagonism of interleukin-6 was agreed by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractor sytokin, induced by various causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no evidence that tocilizumab is a successful cure for CRS.
Transfering clean and improved antibiotics produced by the body of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it is being designated as a non-vaccin passive immunosuppression method.
This strategy has been tried for SARS with unconstitutional results.
The neutralisation of the virus is the mechanism of work expected for passive anti-bodies therapy to mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as single cytotoxicity based on antibiotics and/or fagositois, may also be.
Other passive antibodies, such as monoclonal antibodies produced, are being developed.
Convalence cell production, which is part of the blood of patients who have recovered and contain specific antibodies to this virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of syndromes associated with fever
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Center, who later fell and died because of the COVID-19 after completing his mission to preach the virus.
