New questions on the California Water Supply Project
Critics and Stattaires say they want to know more about what is paid for the 16 billion US dollars project supported by Governor Gerija Brauna after the management of the California Water Supply Administration said that the Brauna Administration offered government funding to complete two massive water tunnels.
Critics claim that the Government's financing described in the Los Angeles metropolis water supply management can be opposed to the long-term state claims that various local water supply management, not California itself, would pay for Brauna's vision of two equal 35-year-old tunnels to refurbish water to the south of the Sacramento River, mainly central and southern California.
The initial expenditure for the construction of tunnels in the amount of US$ 248 million, which is still to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already been initiated by the federal audit investigation.
On the third day, the state legislators also ordered the state audit of the construction of the tunnels.
On Thursday, the state speaker Ms. Vogel said that, despite the Losanjelos metropolis water supply management account, the current planning phase of two tunnels will not be used in the general budget of the state.
However, the opposition of the tunnels and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the representative of the Assembly, Sūzan Ega, one of the statutory state of the audit ordered last week, requested clarifications on Thursday to the state.
"It's a game with the buyers," said David Volfs, the legal director of the Association of Taxpayers of Howard Jervis.
In my opinion, this is related to the evening audit (request): there are many more questions than the answer.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically effective water supply management and water consumers in Central and South California.
Supporters claim that the tunnels will be a good environment and will provide calibrated safe water supply.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the state will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the San Francisco River, harming North California and further threatening local species.
Metropoles and other water supply managers intended to receive water from tunnels still have to be obliged to pay for the uncertainty of whether the investment in soft resources actually brings enough water to repay it.
The same water supply management also announced this year that it would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project was first authorised by the supervisory authority.
On Thursday, a monthly report published by the Management of Water Supply in Los Angeles on a tunnel project states that "the state has indicated that additional funding will be allocated to the completion of the planning phase by state or federal budget."
After all that local water supply management has spent on the project, including 63 million US dollars from its water supply management, "it is expected that the state will use the state money to complete the planning," said Bobs Muirs, director of the Los Angeles Water Supply Management Board.
He then asked Vogeli, a member of the state, questions.
Vogela said that the state is planning to grant money for the completion of the tunnels' planning from the current half-year-old water network, the Čta water project.
However, the construction opponents point to a regulation issued in 2009 which, they say, allows the state to spend money on the construction of tunnels until the water supply authorities from which it will benefit will not accept payment obligations for them.
"The project contractors have agreed to pay for this project and have used financial tricks to cover these commitments," said Patrice Šiferle, an environmental consultant and an old-planned tunnel opposition.
This raises questions about where this money was immediately found.
Business group conversion to China's cybersecurity law
The coalition of international business groups has moved to China with a request to change the proposed cybersecurity rules by warning that they will harm trade and the island countries.
The letters to the Prime Minister of China Li Kecjana have signed 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, expressing global concern that the rules could restrict or impede access to the market for information security products in China.
The signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Service Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products operate and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter dated Wednesday states that this data collection could make it easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical solution in Thailand: since tragedy last year
Zhangs Mengfan claims that the company has won to know what happened in Thailand.
The Chinese leaders plan a series of memory measures to mention a wide range of chemical explosions involving 173 people, the first year, but not all agree.
John Sadvorts reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world would be the anniversary of such a disaster as the people remember and remember.
However, not in China.
Although in the city of Tajikistan a memorial service is held for the memory of some dead fires, such memorials are excluded.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been given what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as members of the family who have been injured, have been warned not to speak to foreign press.
However, 23-year-old Zhangs Mengfan doesn't want to listen.
"This year's society should know something about what happened," he said to me.
I don't want to hear it.
On August 12th, Zhangs was a radio operator in the military firefighting Brigade, just a mile away from the explosive epicenter.
"Shut up tomorrow at 22.53 p.m., and we start sending my team members," he says.
Instead of the event, they could come in within 10 minutes.
There were also teams from other parts of the city to live in a large fireplace.
None of them drew attention to the fact that a large number of light and toxic substances were illegally stored, significantly exceeding the permitted quantities and also without proper supervision.
The Ugunsgreek began when it was authorised to allow nitrocellulose - the chemical substances used in the neck of the neck - to be swallowed up by the party and then to be in the middle of the summer.
Then it spread into a wide area - to 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate in the mouth.
The explosions were discovered and the fireplace where Zhangs Mengfan was waiting for news from the event site, the storm broke in.
This information was not received either.
"When I woke up in the shadows, I cried out," he told me.
I knew what that would mean to my friends.
Eight of his 26 firefighters who were sent to the explosion site were never returned.
Many others find themselves in serious straits and other obstacles.
The largest of the two major explosions were compared to the earthquake, and the sound of the explosion was felt many miles away.
The total amount of losses is estimated at more than $1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
In total, 173 people were killed, of whom 104 were burned alive.
The remains of eight people have not been found.
The investigation authorities of the official government have made a significant contribution to the agreement on corruption, political ties and official secrecy as a result of the provision of rules and the ignorance of security systems.
First of all, I had no need to build such a place to live close to home.
More than 100 officials and company management representatives have initiated some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
So while the Government can point to progress made - thousands of homes and compensations for the population, these sensitive issues remain relevant.
The tragedy has been detected in a broad system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
Its night of fear and duty is no doubt, but without burning like a fire, it is not always an exciting song.
It has a fire extinguisher like a serpent that has been sent out to war without warning to prevent a man’s natural disaster.
Zhangs Mengfan no longer works in the fire-fighting service, but will visit the memory service in Tianjin.
He will bring a message of hope into the hearts of those who have gone astray.
Most of all, I want to tell them: I've kissed your parents and they're doing well.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I will fulfill your duties as a son.
The golden spring could affect the season of squeezing of the swabs
The Scottish Red Cross season will begin later, as the number of birds has decreased over the course of the summer this year.
Several specific shocks have been eliminated because many of the new rubies have not survived in cold weather.
Noting the beginning of the season, the Scotia Game Managers Association (SGA) reports that the shooting of mines provides more work than the Edinburgh festival.
However, the OneKind Animal Protection Fund calls for the end of the "broiling of birds".
The director of the organisation, Harys Hüwtons, said: "The work that is being invested to ensure a large number of birds intended to be killed is huge and inevitable to include some of the most controversial activities."
There is no surprise that the company has avoided this so-called sport and calls on the government to prevent the unsatisfying, unnecessary work that only a very small part of the Scotia population is doing.
The owners of the land also claim that they are committed to maintaining the number of birds and that mining is important for rural economic development.
SGA President Alex Hoggs said that the sector provides 8,800 full-time jobs in the less-favoured regions during the year and that it has been a "best job break" in uncertain times.
He said, "In comparison with many European countries, Scotland has not been so deeply affected by the culture of "medium" and most of the population do not know how the shooting season affects the economy of the country."
Hogs said that the number of jobs provided during the strike exceeded the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, the Fringe Festival, the Tetovation Festival and the Vecgada Evening Festival together.
He adds: "The employment situation in Scotland is now all worrying, especially in the oil and gas sectors, so the players and their families want to see the increase in the sector.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hard workers can rely on these jobs in the future too.
RSPB Scotland considers that at least eight golden stars have been killed in the vicinity of the marine habitat.
Many players recognize that noise is not generally popular, but SGA claims that the industry "have taken significant steps towards better practice."
The day of the opening of the Rubins shooting season is traditionally known as "The Holy Twelve."
However, there is still a lot of debate on this type of sport, and the management of rabies shooting sites is linked to the infringements committed by some natural protection authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that in less than five years, in the mountains of Monday, on the south-east of Inverness, there have been eight golden jars lost.
The Natural Protection Fund considers that they have been illegally killed near the place of strike and their satellite approaches have been destroyed.
Scottish Minister for Environment Rosanna Kanningema said these reports are "very disturbing and exciting."
Ms. Kingemas commissioned officials to analyse evidence of some 90 survivors and missing scars with the drivers to determine whether there is a significant trend in criminal activity.
The clean-up group or RSPB on attempts to raise anti-smoker feelings prior to the beginning of the round season, also said that there was no clear evidence that birds had even gone into the ruins of the Montalita Mountains.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Briony Peijža United Kingdom deserves to be struck in the trampling line
The representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Peijža, cuts the powder in a tramlin line
Briony Paedža became the first British woman to become a medalist in the Olympics in the tramlining of Rio.
Peijža (25) to gold missed 0.425 points because the Canadian representative Rosanna Maclenana had already removed the second Olympic title by order with a result of 56,465.
The World Championship, China's representative Lī Dana was at the bronze, while the second British finalist, Ketrine Driscoll, finished in sixth.
I can't believe I broke the Olympic medal.
I'm so happy," said the emotional Paige.
I didn't realize that it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the training and hard work had been paid back.
I am so happy that I could finally start with Ketu, already a representative's participation would be a historical one, but we were two there.
The highest achievement in international competitions prior to the Olympic Games was the fifth place at the 2015 World Championship in Denmark.
Tramplining in the Olympic Games was introduced in 2000, and this is the first time British women have been given to become final.
Medal reaction.
The representative of the British team, Nathan Beili, the only representative in the competition for men on the tramlining Saturday, was in the exhibition.
Hannah Velana, who participated in the Olympics the second time, soon began to celebrate the achievement of Beijing.
Peiža has been awarded a baarau biology with excellence at the University of Cheffield.
Rio 2016: Figgy fani swirling gold medal in regbi-7
12-year-old boy to see the game, hits half the senses in both the sugar field and the nearest television
Fiji's history of the first Olympic gold medallion in its history has yet to show its degree of popularity
Banks closed, shop closets and prayerers took Suva’s tracks by smoking, smoking and liquefied
Fiji gained gold medals, at Deodoro stadium regbija-7 final with 43-7 saving Britain.
Thousands of people throughout the island country have ceased to take on historical activities.
Fiji's song is a story of the first Olympic medallion
Many of the neighbors were dressed in Fiji’s colors and dressed in crevices, wearing a national flag, and encouraging the team.
When the game ends at the end of the sludge, the sneezers went in the streets, swimming and dancing.
"Many people even stopped their vehicles in full Suvas streets and joined the Fdigy Wars, which did not cause minor injuries to them," reports Fiji Times.
The celebration will certainly continue at the end of the week and next week.
Ireland Premierliga: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron Mackenefs is the first two - half - hour prison in good condition in Finland.
Derry City has gone on to the second one in Premierly, finding a convincing victory with the result of a 5-0 battle with Finn Harps.
Aaron Mackenefs set up a "conferencing fight" under the leadership of the two first half-time sentences, which were awarded for crimes against Lukas Zubert.
Nathan Boils introduced the names at the beginning of the second half of the season, and Šüuberts defeated the opponent in the fourth quarter before Kita Varda won the win, ending the opponent's battle in Finnpark.
Derry is about one point in front of Cork City, and both teams will be in the decisive game on Friday night at Brandievel.
It was Derry's first victory over his northern rivals this season, and I was disturbed by the Harps side.
Mackenef joined the opening stage of the game at 17 minutes after Kirana Kola went out against Schüubert, although the crime appeared outside the prison.
There was no doubt about the second sentence, the former Barijam Moloam's fifth-year-old "Caramel's fight" by letting Sübertam down on the ground and Mackenef's outcome in the third minute after the interruption.
Boys added the exact point after Dinah Jervis's game with the back in the eighth minute after the game started.
Derry City värtsargam Gerard Dohertijam was a quiet evening, but he made a great deal of hiding the words by overcoming David Skallio's guests in the best game to discover.
Schüubert was shot at the bomb in the waves of Kola before he appeared at 83 minutes, and soon followed by Varda's wisdom retreating over the Harps Center for the protection of Richard Brašu.
It was Derry's greatest victory in the series and great preparation of the final game with Cork.
Inverness College of Higher and Island University (UHI)
All 20 students' courses could be missed in the UHI High Media Course of the Inverness College.
Most of them were 17 - and 18 - year - old students who wanted to use the notes received from the studies to attend the university.
Inverness College UHI argues that the quality assurance process is being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) investigates this case.
The SQA press secretary said that the 2016 highest media assessment available throughout the country is "notice as planned".
Inverness College UHI enrolled twenty students at the offered and evaluated course.
Many of the students lived in rural areas for young people who had been taught online, but they often had to be sent to the Inverness College from their places of living, such as Lochéiberas.
One student’s father said that after his daughter’s publications in the social media that he had not received any evaluation of his work, at least 10 also came to the table with a statement that he had not received any evaluation of his course’s work.
He told BBC News Scotland directly that about five more people who received this course in the Inverness College last year, and who were able to contact them, said the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that her daughter cannot provide a place at the University of Glazgov, but she will be able to accept another university offer, thanks to the qualifications received at school.
However, her father said that there were others who visited college organized media courses that were not conducted and who were now "forgotten" and uncertain whether their course work would be reviewed and evaluated with a sign to enable them to attend universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Upstijen and the island.
Dean Rovlinsone, director and executive director of the UHI College of Inverness, said: "We are very important to the results of the exams and the achievements of the students."
It also confirms the vast review of His Majesty's Education Inspection (HMIE) received this year, as well as in comparison with the improved levels of achievement in both secondary and higher education.
As we have done every year all the published results compared with each student predicted.
In this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were taken, and the evaluation body recently reported on "the essential improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "assessments were consistent with national standards."
The SQA is now investigating this case at our request.
The SQA press secretary said: "We are pleased that 2016's highest media evaluation has taken place as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and have seen a slight increase in A-C performance compared with the same qualification last year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and evaluation specifications.
Brothers placed in prison for samurai teeth "assympathies" in Kilmarno
Jason Braidenam is used or used as a serpent, nose, and as a serpent
Two brothers were put in prison for the murder of a man with a samurai tooth after drug-related surgery in Ireland, which was assessed as "in the spirit".
Upuris Jason Bradens (38) was arrested several times in his home in Kilmarno on 5 July 2015.
James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being sentenced to prison.
His brother, John (38), was sentenced to ten years in prison after a minor trial for blasphemy without a previous sentence.
When the two men were sentenced to prison, Judge Bill Danlops told the brothers that they had committed a "severe, painful and vengeful attack."
He rejected any admission that Mr. Braidena was deaf and waiting for them, armed with samurai teeth.
Justice Danlops adds: "You together plan to enter illegally with at least one nation and the innocent."
Jason Bradens may have been a drug dealer, but he was a son, father, and friend.
You gave him up.
After two men were arrested in prison, the criminal police inspector who conducted the investigation said: "John and James Clark have been working hard and dangerously to cause Jason Braiden's death."
In her case, at 38 years of age, there is such a heartbreaking situation that the family must survive.
The court heard before that the brothers from Kilmarnok decided to arrest Mr. Braidena for the gold they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Two alcohols and drugs came to her house, masked her eyes with shelves, and fought with Nazi and Eastern warships.
It is considered that the tooth used in the spleen belonged to the deceased.
The families said that they had seen Clarks crashing down to Braden when he sat on the couch at the bar and heard their screams.
Prosecutor Richards Godards said at the court hearing: "The attack on this man was sustained, hautish."
After that, the place of burial was described as "a spirit".
In addition to the injuries from the two of Braidens during the attack, there was a strong trauma with a long subject.
Three days later he died at Kilmarnos Croshaus Hospital.
The two brothers did not recognize each other in the dark.
In giving the evidence, James Clarks, who has already been tried 38 times, including the attempt to commit suicide, said, "I didn't want it. It was an accident."
John Clarks, who has already been tried 23 times, said that he was only involved in helping a brother who, according to him, attacked Bradens."
A man will be punished for his child’s rape and murder
David Sinclairs met his son in his home in Estklibraid in 2012.
A man who had been beaten and killed by his childhood was in a coma because he did not want to eat, was sentenced to seven years and three months ’ imprisonment.
David Sinkler spent four months at the age of Josué when his home in Estkilbraid, South-West, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of the disease was explained only after the medical examination.
Sinkler (34) was initially charged with fraud, but was recognized as a criminal in a bribe without a prior intention.
In the High Court of Glazgovs, judging him in prison, Judge Lords Breiseidl Sinkleram said: "You threaten your child's son by beating him, creating the wounds he has suffered."
When you beat him, you needed to know that, but you didn't.
Only after basic medical examinations you will know in the affected person.
Your wife believed you.
Now her feelings are gone and you can't support them anymore.
Lords Breiseidll described the consequences of Joshua's death as a disaster to all and added: "Nothing will come back to Joshua."
In the past, the court found that on the day the child died, Sinclairs and his wife, Karstiya, had given Joshua a chance to dance and buy in Eshkilbraid.
At 7.30 p.m., Karstija Sinklere had to meet his mother and grandmother.
Only 11 minutes later, she met Sinklers, who listened to the "schooted".
He said to her, "Joshua won't come as soon as he comes home."
Then he finished the conversation and called 999.
The Jews were immediately taken to Hermiary’s hospital where she died.
At first the cause of Joshua’s death was unclear, but he was looking at the court’s team of medical experts, which had recently been identified as the cause of death’s trauma in the eyes and brains, and such traumas were impossible to achieve.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richards, John Redclifa Hospital Consulting Children in Oxford, said: "This has happened because the child has been injured and thus has found suicides, as well as stopped with greater force than daily."
The defence representative Jans Djügids told the court that Sinkler's "very sorry" was done.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Hloja Tatone Threatened Julija Jefimova's Positions
To the representative of Britain, Tatonou is released from the arms of a bronze 200 m long
The British representative of Hloja Tatone criticises the participation of anti-estimated athletes in the Rio Games after the Russian representative holds them at 200 m.
Jefimova, who was allowed to participate in the games after the complaint about the ban on participation due to doping, was shocked to leave Tatoni in the fourth place.
"They would have wanted them to be completely pure games," said a 20-year-old white fan.
I don't know what you're doing there anymore.
I'm not satisfied with it, but it's what it is.
Jefimova, who moved to another location, learned about her participation in the games just three days ago.
I don't want to see how people get out of sports, but I don't think that's really right.
She was not required to participate in the contest, and a 20 - year - old British representative had to fight a medal.
Rie Kaneto defeated Japan's seventh gold medal in 2016 in Rio, defeating Yefimov, who was on the silver medal.
The Chinese representative Jinlinga This was at the bronze, only for six percent of the remaining Tatoni in the fourth one.
Her British team member, 20-year-old Molly Renšova, finished in the sixth.
"Living in the fourth place is a little bit boring, the same thing that's in front of you," adds Tatone.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little excited about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and that would have been a dream.
However, the final meeting is already a great experience that I will take with me in the years to come.
It was a little bit nervous, but in the long term it will make me strong, and it keeps me going after the medal, so hopefully I'll be closer to it next time.
Tatone only returned in 0.01 seconds from the British record at the end of the 200 m women's dance.
"Every man has to give another chance," said Jephthah.
Yefimova, who said that she had already been moved to answer questions about her doping past, defended her right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was sentenced to 16 months in prison after she was diagnosed with anabolic steroids.
The Sports Solver (CAS) stated that athletes cannot participate in Rio games because they have already been subject to sanctions.
CAS looked at my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and someone has another opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it was definitely not my fault.
Each person has to make a different choice.
When you go and write your sentence, no one gets you in jail.
Bens Prauds takes place in 50 free-style swimming
A British record was previously installed to eliminate the location of men 50 m free of style at the end of the landing.
The Union’s stop at the start of the campaign (21) lasted 21,54 seconds to make the fifth most qualified final of the five days (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is innocent and rude
Indian Sports Minister Vijajs Goels Rio Olympics has been a very busy person, often held in tribine, encouraging Indian sportsmen and taking loans after their beginnings.
However, he and his large company have apparently caused the tension of the Olympic players because of their unmanaged behavior, re-examined by trying to escape to the gymnasiums without adequate accreditation and by reacting with a response by the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Travel Goels, photographed in July, corrects his behavior.
On the third day the Olympic Games organizers threatened to cancel Goela's accreditation if his behavior did not improve by sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter the restricted access to the winery competition in the location and aeronautical location.
"We have received several reports that your sport minister has tried to enter accredited competition zones with non-accredited people," said Sarah Petererson, director of the Rio 2016 Committee of Organisations.
When the staff tried to explain that it was not allowed, the people who were with the minister became aggressive and aggressive, and sometimes they were angry with our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of any such conduct, your sport minister's accreditation will be cancelled and his privileges in the Olympics will be cancelled," the letter continued.
The head of the Indian delegation called this case "from the bridge's escape Zion," and Goels himself said that he did not do anything wrong, writing it all as "responsibility".
On the contrary, he wrote: "As far as I know, we have observed all the rules.
We maintain the Olympic Games and support our Indian sportsmen.
In other words, this Olympic Games are all dreamy in India, and there are no medals in the past.
Those who lost hope in social media indicated that Michael Femps has lost as many medals as India’s history.
A number of prominent candidates have already been excluded, including Mr. Abhinev Bindra, who was awarded gold medals in Beijing in 2008.
This time he stayed in fourth place.
The house is full of money and opportunity," author and author of the Sardonian Twitter article Shoba De.
However, some hopes remain, as there will still be in the competition box, golf, tennis, lightball and, yes, in the bathroom.
The only Indian Winner Dipa Karmakara will concentrate on the final Sunday of the season, showing its bacon double circle "Navas leciens", the Produnovas race, which has tried only a few other Winners.
The country where 1.25 billion people live has always been a cause of confusion.
Analyticals say that there is an unlimited reason for it.
National tourism is a cricket that is not an Olympic sport.
India has not made a major contribution to infrastructure and the training of the Olympics - the first carmamara winning tool was prepared from the spare parts of the old ski resort.
The parents have always emphasized the importance of academic knowledge for sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport are taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has set up the Indian Olympic Association for the violations of its Statutes in 2012 because it has been elected by leaders who have been proposed to be criminalists.
Three Indian black Olympics were even forced to represent their country, carry a flag or wear any national symbol.
They said they were independent sportsmen.
For people with self-sustainment, turbulence is forced to take place in South Dakota on the JetBlue airport route in Boston-Sacramento.
JetBlue was forced on Thursday night to perform an emergency landing after 22 passengers and two crew members were attacked during the storm, reports CBS Sacramento.
Travel 429 from Boston to Sacramento was cancelled in Rapidsiti, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 a.m. after local time.
The airline reports that the injured have been found in a hospital for testing.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to assist the injured, and to Rapidsitija has been banned by the reservation engine to hire other passengers to Sacramento.
The Agency for Drug Control (DEA) has developed a long-term approach to medical marijuana
The answer is unfortunately: little faith.
This is an opportunity for further delays in the delivery of treatment to countless people.
To date, there is only one scientific source of medical marijuana at the University of Mississippi at the federal level.
It seems a little more positive today, the DEA also announced that it will now also allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
There is hope that the available scientific objectives and diversity of marijuana may increase.
Although it will attract attention as a focus on a good study, it will be largely symbolic, because regardless of how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it is not significant.
Imagine a product that is very demanding but is kept behind closed doors.
In response to a request for a goods which makes a difficult decision to produce it more than once, it will never close the door.
This product is marijuana and its contents are in list 1 of these closed doors.
In such an unpleasant situation, there is medical marijuana.
Since marijuana is a substance included in list 1 (relevantly, after the definition of "not currently approved medical use and there is a high potential for its use), there are significant obstacles to the shut-down of the doors.
Potential researchers usually lead to DEA, as it grants permission to start scientific studies.
Even if authorisations are issued for the investigation of substances included in list 1, institutions must comply with very strict safety rules and establish high-level safety systems that may be expensive.
There is also an even more subjective consideration of the receipt of authorisation from its academic authority for the first time studies on the substances listed in list 1.
Even if individual college representatives want to carry out this study, university management may not want problems or potential near results due to negative press reports.
This was done at Arizona University when Dr. Syu Sisli was released from office after trying to face medical marijuana trials.
Finally, Sislija came to seek private funding for her project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was proposed, her project became the first approved DEA medical marijuana trials to prevent post-traumatic stress in the vets.
Then, after years of fighting with bureaucratic obstacles, the National Institute of the Dependence of Drugs has held its last key key.
It is now the largest federal beneficiary of marijuana research and is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if there is an increase in the volume of medical medicine in the free circulation of studies, the institution will still have to approve all the studies it has funded.
However, the problem is, in its name, 'use of bad luck'.
The representative of the University of San Francisco, Dr. Donald Eibrams, who interviewed his documentary film "Marihuan", said that the main task of the institution is to study the substance's potential in the context, not as a medicine.
He will draw attention to an important fact.
Even if the study will overcome all the obstacles listed above, the door can still be closed if the purpose is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than its damage.
Note: In the U.S. National Medical Library, a search for fast (and, to be recognized, unscientific) found 1,434 works for medical marijuana in the last five years.
In this same search, only 57 jobs were for the benefit of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about the damage caused by marijuana, such as "Drug travel due to the anticholinergic effect of marijuana", "Marihuan pancreatitis" and "Marihuan use and risk of lung cancer."
Such a disparity results in the entire disintegration of the soul.
The way to use a medical marijuana is complicated with surprises and silences, where the eye is still visible.
As long as DEA is in line with list 1, regardless of the medical effect, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs maintains a wide range of cannabis patents for medical purposes.
DEA continues to identify marijuana with heroin and LSD as a high-reliance drug potential, even though the very main administrative law of DEA is opposed to it by Judge Francis Jang.
The strict medical significance of marijuana is safer than many widely consumed food products.
For example, the opening of 10 fresh cartridges may cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, it is physically impossible to open so many marijuana to put death in place.
Marihuan is one of the safest known therapeutic active substances in its natural form.
Reasonable analysis of marijuana, as monitored, may be safe in your doctor.
It must be said again that it was proposed by the same DEA judge.
Yet, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we know it or not, all of us in our daily lives accept a certain dose of time.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to say it aloud, or we're so tired or we're upset that no one seems to notice it.
With regard to fraud in the context of the federal medical marijuana policy, there must be persistence in order to present the facts without delay.
The lives of patients, for example, Charlotte Fiji, whose joints are reduced by medical marijuana, and many other lives are dependent on it.
It is worth talking at the highest level about the fact that the mountain can provide so much goodness and still find itself behind closed doors.
Bloody Beethroots: Donalds Tramps "Blondis Berlusconi"
Bloody Beethroots is known in the context of electronic music
Music says Tramps dominates media like Berlusconi
You know, in Italy, we've been at Berlusconi, and I'm looking at Tramps after Blonda Berlusconi, "The Bloody Beethroots, the founder of the electronic banking union, said CNN.
The candidate of the President of the Republic and the political media of Italy, both known to their overskilled persons, the ability to attract press attention and to change history through the media.
"Bloody Beetroots" consists of Rifo is known for his electronic music and has worked with various artists, starting with Lieutenant Seru Polu Makartnija and ending with the electropopist poet of the Greek Svabo Bešu in 2013 in the song "Cronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo is born in Basano del Grapa, Italy, near Venice, in 1977, which is about the time of the birth of the pancreas, and the number "1977" has been added to the music on the chest.
"The English language is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," said Rifo, hiding behind the black taxes he has known.
I'm trying to study, and I'm trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited the Americans to look at "Videocoratium", a documentary film that studied Berlin monopol over the Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made the Italian track," said Rifo, adding that Trampam had a similar impact on America.
"You see how a man can completely turn the system and put everything out... by himself," he said.
I think Tramps isn't good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors were placed in prison for drug trafficking of more than 500 million stars
Two Turkish men have been sentenced to more than 500 million Starlings worth of cocaine contraband on a ship in the North Sea, each being sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mamin Sahins and Emins Ozmens were recognized as the victims of a court trial in the High Court of Glazgo, after about 100 Jews from the Aberdian coast to the "MV Hamal" were found three tons of A drug.
Detainment in 2015 is one of the largest cocaine-contained goods ever held in the sea in Europe.
Maminam Sahin and Emina Ozmen will discuss his role in drug trafficking
One of the largest in British history is the ancient cargo of drugs found on the ship
The drugs were found hidden in a specially designed hiding place on a ship registered in Tanzania, which sailed from Smbang to Tenerif and then to the North Sea.
It stopped the British fleet frigate "HMS Somerset" and a border guard "HMC Valiant".
Sahins (47) was sentenced to 22 years, but Ozmen (51) was sentenced to 20 years in the Supreme Court of Glazgova.
Justice Lords Kinkleiven told men that the amount of drugs was "not only important but desirable", and drug smuggling has "a disturbing impact" on people and the surrounding society.
He said, "You were involved in the most commercial operation, including the carriage of cocaine with ships, the operation that crossed international and really intercontinental borders."
He said that Captain Sahins was not a "drug tree final" but had played a significant role in the crime, while the other Captain Ozmen's role was "something smaller".
The inspectors landed at Hamal, following information received from the French customs authority DNRED, and when it arrived in Aberden, they ran through the steel plate, accessing a secret section where 128 songs with cocaine with a weight of 3.2 tonnes were found, as the average value on the black market is 512 million stars.
In the past year, MV Hamal tested the nuclear fleet.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
In the investigation of ships, it was found that in its balsam trunks the drugs of Class A have been contaminated by tons of drugs.
The ship was on its way from the coast of the Bosfor Sea to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this site was opened under the cover of one of the crew’s compartments, and the spray was sealed.
Sahins and Ozmens were recognised as guilty of the carriage and storage of cocaine during the vessel from 20 February to 23 April last year and of the supply of cocaine from 21 April to 23 April.
Two previously unappointed men who had worked in the shipping sector since the end of school continued to claim that they were innocent, but they accepted the contested judgment.
There is a lack of evidence for charges against four other men.
Sahina lawyer Jonathan Krovs said that the father of two children was "the glorified mouse".
He said, "Someone who was involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to lead the ships.
In view of the drug hierarchy, Sahins certainly is not a drug at the end of the tree, but somewhere below.
The sweet amount of cocaine on the ship meant that it had to be removed by the road screen
The police went through the whole ship a long time before the drugs were distributed on these boxes.
When Sahina turned to questions about his captain's work on Hamal in February 2015, the court listened.
Mr. Krova said that he was "skinned" because of the need to lay down the important events of the girl (9) and the child (13) and "only wants to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since the arrest in April 2015 because their families are still fighting to obtain visas.
Ozmena lawyer Di Morus said that he wants to see his family, but he knows that in the future it will "not be possible".
Speaking of the judgments read today, Professor David Hharviz said: "The international drug trade is not bordering, and we, who have the task of concealing it, work ever harder together to realize that we are one step ahead.
"Scotian achievements in the pursuit of criminals are indeed global, and in this case we have caused significant economic losses to organized crime."
The drugs were built all over the ship, including under the walls.
This Contracting Party Pack Inspectors finds a hidden ship’s cargo space
Mr Härvija added: "Hamal" was identified by reference to the French authorities, and after rapid cooperation with Tanzania, where the ship was registered, the general prosecutor who was also allowed to sail on the ship.
"Our investigation was then given from Giana, who provided access to essential data on consignments, to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information on the ship's detention sites in the Canary Islands.
We also cooperated with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to collect specific evidence together.
Despite the basic investigation that Hamal is wearing a large amount of drugs, representatives of the British authorities in international waters could hardly stand on it without the authorization of the Tanzanian government - something they had never given before.
Sū Pētina, Head of International Justice and Organized Crime Prevention, said: "As soon as the CPS Criminal Justice Council has issued an authorisation of the authorities of Tanzania to board the ship within 24 hours of the date of receipt of information.
According to international maritime law, British officials do not have the right to carry on in international waters on a ship that is under a flag of another State unless that country has a special legal permit to do so.
Without our criminal justice, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we would never be able to call these people responsible.
Photographer Braiens Romeijs's Vulnerable "Austroma Express" train
Photo by Braiens Romeijs from Rotterdam has taken pictures of the train in Belgium
Photo of the railway-based interior, flat-screened seats, flat-screened logs and narrow car cabs
It has already been designated an East Express van, but it belonged to the Belgian National Railway Company
The mayor has taken these remarkable photographs, where the remains of a passenger train, once one of the best moves, have been taken.
Its winter times have been past, and the train wagons and trucks have been left to sleep in a train deck in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photography and experience search engine.
Photographer Brians Romeojns, 40, has taken these horrible photographs, which are seen in the corner of the train's body, buried seats, with open windows and a tight driver's cabin
The Vilcina wagon and lomotives have been left to sleep in a train deposit in Belgium, where they have become an object of public photography and experience searchers.
These wheels were a symbol of gravity when they worked with a legendary name between 1883 and 2009.
A national railway company in Belgium was employed by Lomémotives about 50 years ago.
After 126 years of skiing, the last train to work with an Austrian express name came from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, completing a famous history phase.
The East expression was famous on the Paris - Smong route.
When it started in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as "Express d'Orient".
In 1891, it became the language of the East, and by the 1930s, it had been regular throughout Europe.
It should not be mixed with a private 'Venice Simplon-Orient-Express'.
There is a very small "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury wagon.
In this photograph, there are still measuring instruments and open-air management equipment in a black machine cabin with a type of equipment.
The novelist said that the machine's cab is "in its own way claustrophobics, and the truck trolley must have been unsustainable."
The main vehicle and wagon have become the object of a popular photography and experience search engine.
After visiting the lost train in Belgium, Romaigengs MailOnlineTravel said: "I can really feel how it used in its Jewish times."
Ladies and gentlemen, on the way to the high skies, they join the ladies in beautiful clothes.

A father in Lancashire is born from a school of children about the discovery of T-crekle with a good name
Two children's father was expelled from school for entering school on his sport day in T-crack with a devastating inscription.
Cregis Makbets (36) from Bärnli City in Lancashire said that he was "new" being attracted by the cricket with the title "Lajjam and Dr.am!"
Despite the fact that when he noticed his dream and took the second T-crack, the next day he found that he had been prohibited from entering school territory.
A single father who has been working for four years as head of the Park School in Kolné, Children, was unable to go back to the children because of the ban, and the staff even called social services and police.
Kreig Makbets (36) from the Children said that he was not admitted to school territory after having gone to the children's sport on the T-crack.
Mr. Bjärlija, the school director, accused Saru Midjlija of overreacting too much.
He says he's unreasonably punished because before you look at his two children's adventures, you're wrong after a quick t-circle.
My father, who no longer works as a school manager, said, "There was a mistake and a lack of attention on my part."
I don't think about the sports day and the fast when I get it.
Toward the end of the event, we had a father's consent, and the director noticed my T-crack and said that this was not appropriate.
I went down and threw it on the other side, and that's the end of the matter.
The 36 - year - old man, however, said that he had received a letter from the president of the school that he had been invited to attend the meetings with the director the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had repented.
"Then the school director called me and said that I was forbidden to enter school territory," Mr. Bärnli added.
I learned that after the sport day, some of the parents on the Facebook page were worried about their fears and that many people were interested in them.
Any reasonable person would say that it is overexpressed.
Mr Macbeta, who is editor of the online journal Love Mini, said that he was, of course, unable to come back to the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this was for reasons for calling from school and social services.
On the T-crekle was a Greek Čarlza painting Lister from BBC culture comedy "Sarkanis gold" with one of his iconic words "Lajjam and Dr.am."
He said, "I thanked them that I wasn't there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then she called me from the social services and asked why I was not going back to the girl.
The school also called the police because I didn't come back to her for 40 minutes."
Mr Macbeta said that he was told that he could no longer go to school rooms and that the ban would be in force until further announcements.
He also said that he had been warned that he would be able to apply 500 silver coins if he was caught in a violation of this provision.
Ms. Midjli, Director of the Park Home School, said that this is now over.
Ms. Midjlia, head of the Park School, said: "It is my pleasure to confirm that Mr. Macbeta has left the office and is no longer our school manager."
This case is now over and I hope to return to school in September."
The city councillor John Küniys said that the schools have clear policies and guidelines.
"We all need to bear in mind that taking such titles as counsel or leader applies to you higher standards, and unfortunately he does not answer these standards this time," he said.
In addition, Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school required him to apply a ban and that he was saved from the bridge.
Mr. Nixon added: "This T-cracking was boring, and he also regretted it."
The Lancashire police confirmed that they had been summoned from school, but they did not leave.
In recent times, former VEF facilities in the area of Freedom have been renovated - there are several IT companies, the sector has already begun to call this area the local island of Silicia.
The other VEF territory, including Bárzaunes, has also been developed.

Legal protection: Demagogy on the compulsory health insurance model with additional financial burdens does not hold any criticism.
Any demagogy on compulsory health insurance that would impose direct and increased burden on the people of the paying house is not held in any way critical, shall be considered by juris Janson's lawyer.
Today, Janson met with Health Minister Andu Chaksu to discuss the health situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, Janson's journalists said that the Minister of Health offered a sustainable and developed health care system would make it more accessible to patients.
He also noted that additional funding for health care should be discussed in this case, as it is currently insufficient.
Janson also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance that would impose direct and increased burden on the people of the population is not critical, particularly when the Dutch model is called.
Janson said that the Netherlands's health is 11% of the total domestic product, while Latvia is only 3%.
Therefore, the Government and Parliament must be responsible enough to understand that the point of this reconciliation must be taken away, given legal certainty and added that the model offered by the Ministry of Health (VM) will not work.
The Czechs thanked the Ombudsman for the support and indicated that the main concern was that the patient should be contacted by a doctor, which means that the health care system needs additional funding.
The Minister also pointed out that the planned additional EUR 35 million would be possible next year only to make the most urgent cases for oncological patients and birth specialists.
Therefore, VM has developed a plan and submitted an additional EUR 41 million request for health care to reduce interest rates to specialists and research.
"The question of priorities, whether or not the means will be found," said Chucksche.
This amount does not include an increase in remuneration for doctors.
Commenting that the doctors are not surprised at the fact that all three health care funding options for VMs are addressed by the government to the government, including those that provide additional payment for patients, Czechs said that the government is given the opportunity to develop all three models.
Janson also adds that it is possible to demonstrate clearly that Latvia is not ready to put extra burden on the population by driving all three models.
It has already been reported that VM will defend the option of the health care financing model, which does not provide for an increase in the overall tax burden, but calls for a part of the social tax to be addressed to health, as set out in the summary of the concept report on the change in the model for the financing of the health care system in Latvia.
At the same time, both the Ministry indicated that the best funding model for health care would be selected as a result of the discussion by the end of September.
Locals are already ready.
After this year, you will recognize Grobin's new wife, a former Arajian farmer, Rolands Dambis.
We're probably already on the Liepaja market.
By creating several early varieties, but the preferred bubbles have been well stocked, the letter’s regional newspaper Course Time.
"Now it's better to grow than in the past year," says the builder of a large cave in Rucavas village, Artis Kousis.
In the long run, this is much better than in the past when it was hot and windy.
Starts the Lisbon theatre hotel in Riga.
On 12 and 13 August, the Riga Theatre will be visited by the Lithuanian Theatre, offering viewers both the "Game Night" awards, as well as the bright inspiration of the Lithuanian theatre director Herbert Laukstein's monostherapies, informs the "Delfi" portal of the theatre.
On the evening of August 12th, viewers will be shown the "Ziloņciman" of the human drama studied by director Laura Groza-Kiber.
This is the story of a real historical person - John America - who lived in the Victorian era in London and in his body, born with a deformity of the disease, was named Zilongman.
In the study, an actor is represented by Egons Dombrovskis, who received the title "Gada Actiers" for the role of America.
As the critic of Normand Akots described his actions, Merik is a "cour heart-breaking" role in which the birth picture is not repeated."
On 13 August, viewers will be offered a study "Portraits".
The exhibition has received six "Game Night" nominations, including "Gada's big show".
The director designed the study as a unique portrait gallery, as important as giving each style of play, so that each of them has a centre and a background.
The exhibition consists of several minutes of exhibitions that finally concluded in a single universe.
It is an observation of a person’s nature, where the main conflict between true emotions and austere calculation, often revealing how a person changes in different situations - each one of the guards is a wolf who, because of his greed and his goodness, is buried in the surroundings, sometimes a sheep that is buried by someone else.
On the other hand, both of these data will be played in the Mása medicine in Liepaja's theatre director Herbert Laukstein's monoise exhibition "Man who differs from the lift" in the Galinian Polišchuka regime.
It's not funny, but humor is full of stories about how a person's only friend becomes a lift.
Despite the capsylist, which dominates the visual appearance, the dominant intuition of the study is clear and even optimistic.
"People who are different from lifts" is not about loneliness and age, but about that life is worth loving.
Also, if it seems that there's nothing about what's going on, the critic Ligga Ulberte wrote about the show.
Tickets on all studies can be purchased in the "Biljes Paradises" box and on the Internet.
Detective Olga: My work is not a series but a real life.
I am already in the middle of waiting for Olga Zelíka - the owner and investigator of the Riga Detective Agency.
His brain smells and leaves a very positive person's impression.
The white biscuits and the white jacket - a very elegant woman who covers all my ideas about what must be a woman's detective.
She's waiting for me with a champagne from which I'll be able to answer.
I'm sorry I talked to him because I think it's interesting that women are working with such unusual things.
This is always the work of men.
Olga is the highest legal education - the degree of master.
I've been working in the criminal police.
You know, you want something you want and you've built your company.
It's been known for five years.
"I really didn't want to go back to the police," says Olga.
It's routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated matters, collected information.
We're dealing with suspects.
"Now I've been in Sweden for ten years, a press release for the Riga Detective Agency."
She's calling for a party party: "There won't be a party."
All are faithful people.
Asked about her business, Olga says, "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I was a team.
After that, I realized that sometimes working on a team is dangerous.
It's a business when, now that someone is not working professionally, it can happen in a very bad situation.
If the journalists are five, then we're second.
Sfera, of course, is not simple.
Many try to get us into debt because we are dealing with the mistakes of others.
Let people think about it!
Many come and ask if you can put the hearing equipment, touch the dogs.
Many have seen films.
The detective business is serious.
"It's a collection of information," says Olga.
If there is a crime under the law, I need to be warned about it.
In summer, the grass is green and green - so that it is at least the breast to which the conversations are held and the roots are broken.
I've been a client who's a man who's always on the site.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was a man.
At first everything is beautiful and good, but then it begins.
"It's the most dangerous thing," says Olga.
Psyche is secreted, and it happens that you can stand up against the thief.
That was the worst thing I've ever done.
God does not give himself.
That's very dangerous.
People become vampires at some point.
"Many women try to move away from their families and then come back," she says.
I'll reject the last order.
"That was the first time in my life," says Olga.
There was such a bad situation.
The woman was pregnant, she had a son.
"She's a boy's seat and made an invaluable," Olga recalls.
I believe that a woman has a mother instinct and, firstly, she needs to protect her child.
When it all happened, she came to me asking to be in her husband’s house.
There are people who have been hurt by cruelty.
The most dangerous thing is that my mother looked at it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now invaluable.
We couldn't find the lake once, and the lake was very helpful.
In the drug section, no dogs can be seen without dogs at all.
"I understand that there are right people and there are those who are not healthy psyhe," she says.
Of course, the facts are current.
The family is also divided, and information needs to be collected.
It's clear what's the worst part.
The last thing I’ve ever heard about is the fact that other friends have become friends.
That's interesting, because sometimes men laugh, now they're women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women's "take" friends for 100 and over a thousand euros.
Women need to be careful to go to foreigners because they can sell them.
"Latvies women are intelligent and very trustworthy," Olga says.
There have been cases when you go abroad to be appreciated again.
That's not legal.
Olga says that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
It's getting bigger, it's getting dead.
When I was 22, there was a tragedy.
He had a serious headache.
He came back as a completely different person.
"I'm taking her out," Olga remembers.
It could be compared to a ball, it was dangerous.
The question is, what is the most extraordinary thing that has come up with, Olga says, "It's all special, but it's the most important thing where trust is used."
When the stolen "take" is stolen.
He's taking over and doesn't give money.
If you have legal education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is just like a detective, the other is it," says Olga.
Situations when facing a crisis of mistrust are likely to be tragic, since women are often not prepared to deal with the situation.
She's not ready to accept the result.
This is an unexpected situation, since a person is not ready to lose his family.
Not every woman is ready to accept reality.
Often, young girls who feel the urge to spend money spend on wealthy men.
One man who followed his wife said that he could not be that she was not in love because all the women were wrong.
"He was a merchant three times," Olga recalls.
At that time, there is a man's problem if all the women are wrong.
Olga tells us about the case when a man left his wife and all the children, and she asked him if he ever had a hand on him.
I've always sat him down, he's answering.
In such cases, I will be responsible for working.
I think it's interesting how things are resolved - or they're taken to a photograph and a life story, if there's evidence of fraud.
How is this happening?
"There is protection of data for natural persons in parallel to the work of detectives," says Olga.
This is a provocative question.
One law allows you to do everything, the other doesn't allow anything.
For personal interests, we may take such photographs and videos, but there is no public view.
If there is a matter that does not comply with the law, there may be serious problems.
In order to become a detective, lack of education and experience, there must also be a mental health and meet the criteria.
We don't take the press, the police are working on it.
I'm saying to customers - turn off the serials, here's the real life!
In fact, when I worked in the police system, dogs were also used, they were very helpful.
"No dogs can be seen without dogs at all," says the tale of Olga.
Some customers approach me about the search for secrets, but I don't like to take such matters.
They're very serious.
Now there are more and more clients of men, because women may complain about men.
There were times when it was different.
Now the women are going out, but the men are sitting at home with the children.
"Of course, most people are suffering properly," says Olga.
I like Deil in Kärnege.
He says - stop and start living real.
We all know that if you follow one child, you have to push the other but you can't!
You have to say that you don't like it.
It must not be done.
There is no need to worry about losing one’s life!
You can't become a minor, and we're going to do what we're allowed to do with ourselves.
Yes, my first case was directly related to the man’s mistrust when the woman was not ready to accept the fact that the man was wrong.
She called all the time and asked what to do with her.
"I'm now asking all customers whether she's willing to accept the situation when she knows that a man is really wrong with her," Olga says.
It's not an explanation, it's a life.
If you're here and a loan detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theatre, it's a theater, it's a real life.
I also need a specialist.
It's the heart thing and it's related to Japanese medicine - treatment with hands.
It's very interesting.
Why did I start working with that?
This is associated with a large amount of adrenaline, and you need something to smell.
The needs are not only designed, but they are renewable, enlightened.
"People leave my office positive and satisfied," says Olga.
She has a series of signs at the wall office, and Olga tells her that it is written, not with the help of the door, but with the keys.
I didn't just get it until I got it, the book about my needs was literally put in my hands.
I'll feel it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
More than you need to know here.
Olga's crying, too.
It's her haircut.
We're all afraid of nature.
From the age of 11, I played guitar.
I've recorded the sounds and the clips.
I'm positive and funny, but I need to rest to get back.
Others save alcohol, I need it.
Alcohol's on the floor.
The police use it a lot because the work is full of stress.
"It causes aggression, and the journeys can be unpredictable," she says.
I'm interested in sports and games.
15 years is nodarbees or tennis.
I still had to go with the pigs.
I'd like to write a book, of course.
The detective work has a narrow limit when the job comes into your life.
"It's a job that shouldn't be put into life," she says.
The question of how to combine work with private life is, Olga says, "My dear man is in Italy."
We have a very strong feeling.
It's the most loving thing in my life.
I'm tired of thinking about him, and I'm feeling better already.
Detectives don't usually trust me, but he's taken my job.
I actually cut off my job from my private life.
I didn't get into this business the same way.
I've got a lot of stuff in my mind.
When I was a child, I saw more than anyone else.
Due to the needs, open intuition.
There's a lot of detectives, but really working -- little.
In any case, it's work with the brains, and it's hard to turn off.
You need some rest, too.
"That's why you can't come back," Olga admits.
The worst case I've ever worked with is the story of Constanti.
I've been working on it for years.
The man was deliberately jealous of his wife.
I did so that my mother and I, however, moved to England - beyond the threat.
Please select another option.
We shouldn't be sorry for ourselves.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
We have to agree on every day that we have.
Thank God.
Three good things must be said every day to someone else.
A good work should be done or a day should be given to itself.
We shouldn't have opened it with men.
It's a big mistake.
Of course, we have a man, not a child, and he needs to take care of us.
If it's not good, you have to push and move forward.
You can go to the church, it's very helpful to me.
You don't have to be a fan, but do what you like and help.
Nothing will change if not changed. You have to move forward and change your way of life.
In no case should you put yourself and your children in danger.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
Humans are created to do good and to support one another.
If God has created us, we are already needed and are no part of this world.
You must never sit on the spot!
How to prepare for the family photosession.
The summer is still in full swing, and it is a long time for the regular year of learning that families are going to burn in the photos.
To make the picture look happy and beautiful, it is worth considering how to prepare for the photograph before.
"Ihappyma" offers a multi-year-old mother, Aleksandra Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
You have to photograph it in nature because it's much more natural and harmonious.
In the study, children find it much more difficult to get in and out.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style for the whole family, which is in one color.
For example, Alexandra relates that she chose clothing for all six of her family members so that the clothes were not more than three colored tones and possibly less written on it.
Don't forget about good luck.
Feel comfortable, play, but do not lie or think if the child is not as obedient as you would like.
And, look, the next advice is already taken from the professional photographer's office!
You need to understand what you want to do during the photosession and tell about it.
Some of them will be beautiful, loved children and ideally formed family image, others - "life is what it is", i.e., in the pictures you want to see the real, real emotions, or how you like to say the photograph yourself, - "fleet mugures", "swift eyes", "scared deugal".
Of course, it may be that someone wants "two in one", but it happens rarely.
In any case, it must be understood that it is only a few hours away from your life, and it will be less effective because it is better.
You are yourself - not even a strong mother who works, ready to eat, a garden, and still, and not always taken by a father who speaks harshly on the phone.
Nor is he the man who lives next to you a stranger.
Be a family, remember how great it is to share one another’s thoughts, feelings, and feelings.
And then the task of photography will only be to convey the real miracles to the emotions that govern you.
If you've chosen a photograph, you'll trust him.
There are 250 times left to ask to show what has happened, when she has made her choice of clothes, instead of the best frames.
Keep and wash all the clothes needed before the photosession day should no longer work with it.
Plan the route and think about how much time you will need to get to the site of the photosession (especially if the photography takes place in the study and the time is limited).
If you have small children, choose the photosession time that corresponds to the departure day mode, so that it will not occur during the time when the baby usually sleeps on the day.
And, of course, it is unforgettable to take with children food, vegetables, water and the most loving roulettes (butts and salts only in extreme situations).
He prepares his father that he may have to wear a jacket, but it is usually not written in such subscripts, and only photographs know what it is about to recognize Marina.
A few times a lot of water before and before photosession.
And it would still be recommended after photosession to gather all together some explanation.
Go to an attractive park, get some ice cream, get acquainted with the craters - which has a more network for the family.
It will bring you great pictures at the same time and pleasant memories of the day spent together.
Krasnopjorovs and Fadejeva: Creating a minimum wage - for the economy of the country or the brems?
The question of the establishment of a minimum wage in the public debate is almost either the status of the holy cow: whether it should now be supported by an increase, or the absence of any unsolicited, general phrases.
Given the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (only the buttons avoided from technical recession), it is important for us to stress that the creation of minimum wages is not a surprise that will reduce the inequality of income at home, close to the Western European level and will complement the national budget.
On the other hand, if the minimum wage is too much, it results in more damage than benefits, as its creation reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, particularly in sectors and regions with low income.
In the first pillar, it appears that, despite several minimum wage increases in post-crisis periods, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that the creation of some 10 euro-year-olds would significantly lower the competitiveness of companies - only EUR 370 while some countries in the European Union (EU) have a minimum wage of approximately half a thousand.
However, compared to the average wage country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
As the share of the minimum wage recipients in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6% [1]), a similar share of the minimum wage is linked to most companies.
According to the findings of the Latvian Bankings’ survey, each fifth Latvian company replied that it was important or very important to increase the prices of the products by increasing the minimum wage at the beginning of 2014.
This means that, firstly, the minimum wage levels were partly financed by consumers (i.e. the inhabitants of Latvia); secondly, the increase in prices meant a loss of competitiveness for many companies both in the domestic and foreign markets (i.e., increased imports and limited exports).
Because of increased competitiveness and the volume of production of sugars, it was important for almost every fifteen-year Latvian company to select workers (which means greater unemployment and immigration).
In addition, almost every one-hundred-and-a-half-year undertaking was responsible for restricting the employment of new workers in the impact of the minimum wage creation.
It is worth noting that the minimum wage in Latvia has not changed in 2011 - 2013.
Therefore, even if, on the basis of the 2014 minimum wage creation, each 5 undertaking has noted the importance of improving productivity, it does not yet mean that similar results could be expected in 2017 (the fourth minimum wage increase could result in a series of production opportunities).
Another important result is - due to the scale of the minimum wage, it was also important for several companies to increase the wage of employees who benefit more than the minimum wage.
The impact of the minimum wage was thus important even for undertakings where no minimum wage was received by any of the employees.
In recent years the minimum wage increase in all three Baltic countries has exceeded the nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
Thus, the further increase in the minimum wage (even though at a low level in the euro as a whole) will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
In assessing the justification for the establishment of a minimum wage, analysis of the average economic rate is not sufficient.
It should also be assessed whether the establishment of a minimum wage is in the sector and regions where the minimum wage is most commonly used.
The results of the Latvian Bank’s argument show that the minimum wage employee is the largest concentration in small enterprises (number of employees from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the proportion of workers in the industrial and service sectors with minimum wages was higher (16% and 19%) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latvia, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), can be affected more quickly by reducing the demand for labour (i.e. maintaining its high unemployment) and promoting the economic stability of the lakes.
Some indications show that the minimum wage deficits implemented in 2014-2015 (over 27%) have weakened Latgale's development.
For example, Latgale is the only Latvian region in which unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there is no region in Estonia and Lithuania that would be so much left to the average wage from the rest of the country.
For example, in Estonia, the average wage in all regions exceeds at least twice the minimum wage in the country.
The lowest wages in Lithuania are in the Taurages region, but the minimum wage was 54% of the average wage in 2015 (because of two fast minimum wage increases in 2016, this figure could reach 58%).
In the public debate, a temporary call for a minimum wage up to 68% of the average wage country (e.g., here) is lacking economic justification, and this is not implemented in the short term, not in the long term.
Firstly, such a high figure from the average wage or even so close to it is not in any EU country.
Secondly, this would mean setting up a minimum wage on average wages in several sectors of the economy (which would mean the release of banking and mass of these sectors), such as clothing, the production of leather products, the processing of fish, food services and veterinary services; and this is more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
The creation of a minimum wage from January 2017 to EUR 400-410, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make a minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average wage) one of the highest EU.
If nominal productivity is higher than 4% but the minimum wage is at least twice as rapid, there is an obvious negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
Such negative effects will most likely be spread in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage has already been used frequently, such as in Latvia.
The fact that significant minimum wage levels cannot be allowed at present means that other mechanisms should be used for low wage beneficiaries' support.
The effect of incentives can be achieved by travelling with citizens' income taxes to a minimum unfavourable (budget limits).
Insufficient level of education, inadequate quality of education and poor quality of education, as well as poor health conditions (which often occur, not due to the expense of medical services and the length of the line) between income inequality.
During the investigation, 521 replies were received from the Latvian company to the minimum amount of the salary that occurred in January 2014.
The survey took place under the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project of the European Central Bank system.
These figures represent companies with a staff population of not less than 10.
It also explains the specificity of the low staff with minimum wages in construction.
11 fires registered in Latvia on the dedicated day show operational information from the State Firearms and Rescue Service (VUGD).
In the spring, the larger fires of the Ogres had emerged in the west of Ogresgal, where an 80-quarter - square - mile [80 sq km] unit was burned in the uninterrupted house and in the Jäzcelmala Valley, where the open fire was clearly filled with a 30 - square - square - square - foot - wide stream.

Legendary editor Hafington calls "The Huffington Post".
Arianna Hafingtone, the assistant editor and chief editor of the influential US media holding "The Huffington Post", announced his release from the company after 11 years of work.
The Huffington Post, founded in 2005 and awarded by the Pulicer Award, which offers every day a serious policy and economic journalist and an online sensor display, is considered to be a media development target during the rapid development of digital technology solutions.
The media, already starting work in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for their time in situations where there was still no Tuesday, but the feisbux gained popularity only among students in the national colleges.
Not long after the re-election of the representative of the Republical Party, George Bush, the President of the United States, did not hide that media journalists represent liberal values, and with such a global view, they will also prepare information materials.
Now Hafingtone has found on Twitter that he is ready to start a new business - his plan to set up a "Threive Global" initiative that would address the health and burden of employees.
At the moment, we don't know what could be in her place under "The Huffington Post".
During her work, the portal rejected anonymous comments, stressing Hafington that freedom of speech is granted to people who are aware of what is said and who do not hide behind anonymity.
In addition, in her management, a decision was taken in February 2015 to publish reports on the US presidential candidate Donaldu Trampu in the statement section.

Four people were killed in Thailand.
During the last 24 hours, nine disasters have occurred in Huai, Thailand’s capital and southern provinces, killing at least four people and several tens injured, the power authorities reported on Friday.
In southern Thailand, two explosions occurred on Friday about eight hours after local time.
One judge exploded in front of the seabed police building, killing government officials and attacking a man, reported in Surathana, governor of the province Vongsiri Promčana.
"I think it's related to the explosions in Huhai," said the governor.
The second blast occurred in front of the provincial police station.
On Friday afternoon, two events took place in the tourist village of Phóketa.
On Friday morning, in Huahai, two prisoners were fired at the bell tower, killing one and killing three people.
It has been reported that on Thursday evening, just before midnight, two explosions in Huahin, the capital city, killed one woman and killed 19 more people, including foreigners.
On Thursday, the murdered woman was a farmer.
Of the 19 injured, three were in serious condition, and seven of the injured were foreigners — four women and three men.
In Huhai, Bomba was hidden in two holes that were 50 meters away.
The brakes were detonated with mobile phones with a half-hour interval.
Four days earlier, a man was in a tragic accident that took place in the province of Tranas in southern Thailand.
Police rescue babies from traffic; parents will find safety in the courts.
Last night the local police rescued the children from the car they were in, while the children’s parents threatened the police with court cases for the car glass that had been set up, and the agency informed the Riga State Police (RPP).
On the afternoon of the afternoon, a man who told me that the trading center of Spice had noticed a car in the parking lot, where there was a bird in half an hour without an adult presence.
When entering the location of the event, a car specified by the driver was found, which was located in the sun.
There was a child sitting in the front seat of the passenger seat where the child was found.
The sun went directly down on the child.
The Jewish voice was loud and loud, and her voice was heard thundering and lightning.
In view of the fact that the owner of the vehicle is not located, a decision shall be taken without delay on the rear of the vehicle to prevent the health and life of the child.
The child with all the seats is derived from the interconnected vehicle and called medicine.
The child breathes cells, the skin was red and hot, so before the medical intervention, the sacrament of the procedure was made on the surface of the skin.
At the same time, doctors and parents have been involved in the event.
The father of a deaf father, who built a room for his car, remained aggressive and did not expect the child to be present.
The discussion with the parents has been conducted and it has been explained that children under seven years of age are forbidden to leave alone without supervision.
In addition, the child was left to health and life at risk.
After the discussions, the doctor examined and found that hospitalization was not necessary.
On the other hand, the children’s parents categorically refused to provide any explanations about the incident and threatened with court proceedings for the vehicle’s construction.
During the interview with the parents, there was no evidence that they were in the habit of alcohol or, like others, could harm the child, so an elderly child was placed in both care for less than four months.
The material was sent to the Children’s Legal Crime Prevention Section, which staff will assess the parent’s responsibility.
The RPP reminds us that even if it is not very hot outside, the engine is left in the sun to rise very fast.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, it may endanger their life.
The LPF members could ask Poni to be installed.
The members of the Latvian Federation of Pledging (LPF) could, in the near future, request the President of the Federation to withdraw its current leader Kasparu Poni, the agency of the LETA informed the former vice-president of the federation, Janis Dzines.
In view of the recent criticism of Poni and his activities in the federation, several LPF members have signed a letter requesting that the LPF meeting be convened by the highest federation institution and that it is entitled to resolve any issue raised in the LPF Assembly.
The members of the Federation were not satisfied with the style of the Pones leadership, and his arrival to the Olympic Games in Riodezáneiro, where he had no opportunity to give the Latvian record to the well-being trainer Alonas Ribakovas in the Olympics, German Jakubovski, is considered to be an unethical and disrespectful act of the President.
The day indicated that the LPF members, as well as the federation Secretary General Avar Platonovs, have achieved a great deal of work for the development of the federation and sport, but the dosage of Pones to the federation is not highly appreciated.
The day I worked for a long time in the federation made it clear that the federation had been trying to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
Accordingly, the members of the federation could also be required to amend the regulatory statutes for the operation of the LPF which would exclude such a possibility in the future.
The day explained that the discrepancy with the Pone's work in the Federation had lasted longer, however recent events have served as the members of the "last pillar" federation to make a decision to be taken.
The former Vice-President of the Federation indicated that during the activities of the Pones, there was a very low level of training and the work of the Council of Judges.
The day explained that in order to ensure the speedy process and decision-making in the federation, LPF members at a meeting had decided to authorize the board of directors of Pone and two vice-presidents to conduct the federation.
However, as June acknowledged, the Lord invited the members of the Federation.
The members of the federation relied on Ponem, believing that the federation would be able to make decisions more quickly.
"He encouraged the men's confidence because he practically took the power in his hands to create an inevitable hole," Dzis said.
"This attitude cannot be from the person who should serve as an example to other sports representatives," Dzis admits.
In the opinion of the Vice-President, Mr Dana, he has tried to satisfy his ambitions, which also does not favour him as President of the LPF.
The Permanent Secretary-General of the LPF, Vladimir Maslovski, informed the LETA that a letter to the federation could be submitted the following week, so that the meeting of the LPF should be held within a month.
In his view, there are "all the issues that have been affected" at the meeting and should be decided on a future action.
Mr. Friday was not yet informed that the LPF members are planning to call a meeting in which they might decide to leave their home.
At the moment, I don’t know anything about holding such a meeting, so I don’t have a comment.
As for the fact that the members are not satisfied with my work, so far there has been only one case, with the already mentioned coach Jakubovski, when there has been some discontent.
Before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he joined the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) with a complaint and called on Latvia not to send any sportsmen.
"After this case, Jakubovski lost the senior trainer's team because his action was not in line with LPF's interests," said Pone.
He also pointed out that the LPF members of the meetings in which they referred to the action had been taken did not so far receive the translation.
"On the contrary, we have acknowledged that the quality of the federation's work has improved," said the LPF president.
Mr President, I also made it clear that the Olympics in Riodezáneiro should not be explained but worked.
Most people in Latvia are not clear and do not understand what the role of the federation presidents is.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these fields, and for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) we do not receive wages.
At the same time, we need to make sure that the sport type federation is eligible for funding, as only 10% of the necessary amounts are received from the country's LPF.
During the Olympic Games, I have had a formal and informal meeting with representatives of international federations and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"There have also been negotiations and I have worked to make Riga one of the world's causes in 2018," Mr.
According to the Portal's "Frimas.lv" data, in 2015, LPF revenue totalled EUR 249,444, which is less than EUR 36 000 more than in 2014.
Approximately 40% of these amounts have only been set up for targets, with an increase of around EUR 10 000 compared to 2014.
In the form of membership, membership and other annual contributions, LPF also received about 43% of revenue or EUR 109 442.
In the form of grants and grants, the federation received only EUR 35,532.
The federal spending compared to 2014 increased by around EUR 70 000, totalling EUR 263 876 in 2015.
The higher expenditure was not linked to the payment of money to persons, neither to material expenditure, nor to payments - EUR 215 733 as "other expenditure".
Money payments cost people €20,549, while pay is €14,684.
If the 2014 federation was closed with a positive balance sheet, the 2015 LPF concluded with a negative balance sheet.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) asked the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) for an explanation of the participation of LPF President Pones in the Olympic Games in Riodezáneiro, which had not yet been forgotten by the Latvian coach Ribakovas.
Latvia's state-owned victims in Thailand are not suffering, reports the social website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (AM) on Twitter.
The Ministry indicated that, according to the Council of Latvia, the information available in Thailand did not suffer in the Latvian state-owned disasters.
LETA has already reported that the AMM invites passengers to regularly follow along with information on the developments in the country's political and security situation, as well as to ensure the safety of the place of residence, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvia calls on the AMA to avoid human trafficking, to be particularly careful and fair, to maintain public places, and to follow along with the instructions of local authorities.
Travellers located in Thailand’s districts or planning to continue their journey are invited by the Ministry to contact travel operators or airlines by specifying whether the travel path will be carried out in accordance with the planned plan.
The Ministry also invites passengers to regularly follow along with information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to ensure the safety of the place of residence.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.

However, the Mes will not be able to read Argentina football.
After a short sale, however, the football superstar Lionel Mesi decided to return to the country of Argentina on Friday, the player himself announced.
In July Argentina's second year after the fall of a series of cities failed to complete the Copa America tournament, re-examined the Chilean transition.
Immediately after the loss, the Messiah announced that he would be able to return to the country, but then he was told that he could return.
"I seriously consider the possibility of getting out of school, but my love for Argentina and reading is too much," said 29-year-old Messi.
Spain's Great Barcelona shooter in the Messian national line total of 112 won 55 words, which is the best indicator all the time.
Along with the adult education, the Messiah has not been a great success, although in 2014 Argentina has become a world champion.
Mesis five times called the world's best football player.
For the Chinese, the Son and Dzelina have doubled Rio 20 km walk distance.
The Chinese explorers Vans Dzeņs and Cai Dzelins crossed a 20-mile highway on the fifth day of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Olympic champion was crowned by Jenn, who spent the distance in 19 minutes and four seconds at the end of 12 seconds to arrest Djelin.
On the other hand, Australian poet Deins Bärds-Smits, who lost Jenna 23 seconds.
The family's favorite Kaju Bonfims improved Brazil's record, but he missed five seconds to climb to the beautiful 5th table.

At the same time, he had two medals in the world champions.
Judo coach Baskin: Nikiforenko is not a real force.
The Latvian killer trainer Olyegs Baskins warmly acknowledged that Arturam Nikiforenko Rio Olympics was not as difficult to overcome as the most powerful Azerbaijani athletes, Uzang Kukauri.
In practice, it was not only minimal if it had been issued to pull it to a method or party.
We were already planning on it.
He was prepared for the right fight, as well as for the right fight, but the enemy was stronger.
The opponent was well known because Nikiforenko had already fought him twice and lost both Arthurs.
But he's worse.
The art is artificially transferred to the worst weight category in order to enter the Olympic team.
The weight category has already been taken up to 100 kilograms, so Arturus used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
Arthritis weighing 100 pounds [100 kg] was fought against a killer with 140 pounds [140 kg] and several times had already won a heavy tournament.
In the heavy weight category, however, there is a very small moment of discomfort.
If you were in the light of weight categories in years, then you were very rare.
On the question of whether Nikiforenko would be better able to fight one step in the lightest weight category, Baskin replied positively.
I think it's best for Arthur to fight in the category up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not a real force.
65% of Venezuelans want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are willing to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to reinstate President Nikolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Elections Board announced that "no time" this year for the withdrawal of the vote that would take place in the power fields by 2019 - people in Karakas have continued their early days as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't know it because I saw Olympic games and how Michael Femps gained two more medals," said Rafaels Deeans, 36-year-old office worker who spent three days in Altamira's village.
At the beginning of 2014, the Altamira area in the east of Karakas was an infamous epicenter protesting the Maduro regime.
However, now that opposition has to exert greater pressure than ever to achieve the referendum this year, people throughout the country are no longer displaying such energy.
"I would like a referendum, but for security reasons the protests are not shared," said Deans.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, but recognize that the Russians are not so motivated.
The president of the Board of Appeal, Tibijes Lusena, made a statement that the government is stopping the withdrawal process.
I protest only when opposition calls for protest, but I know that some of my friends are in danger," Roberto Reyess, (60), said Fox News Latino.
Thus, in addition to all the bars that the government has set up to stop the referendum, the opposition is now faced with a new challenge: to motivate people to go out and protest.
More recently, the referendum initiative had a wide range of support - people have entered the summit in the capture phase.
However, when it comes to protesting the government's efforts to block the efforts, the number of candidates is smaller.
"Many people are focusing on the development of food chains, while others are at risk for many after 2014 arrests and deaths," said Cipriano Eredia, an opposition lawyer.
After Lusena announced that, until the next step in the referendum process - even more than a few more signatures in the whole country - those against the Socialist Government will have to wait until October, they say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to remove the Russians from danger by letting them believe that the vote is practically impossible today.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum was held in 2017, Maduro could be dismissed from office, but he would be allowed to appoint the next president.
If he is allowed today, he is obliged to make a general choice.
The Department of State of the United States will address this issue on Thursday afternoon by calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee compliance with the constitutional rights of the Venezuelan people.
"The remaining steps for the implementation of the president's withdrawal referendum should be made clear, concrete and immediate, thus contributing to the rapid and effective solution to the current political, economic and social difficulties in the country," it was written.
Luis Salamanka, a political analyst who was a member of the Governing Council during the period 2006 to 2009, that changes are not expected as soon as possible.
"I believe that this year's referendum will not be until social unrest and protests become stronger," he said FNL.
He said that Lucene and the government violated the law, but as a result, they would achieve their goal if people did not protest.
The opposition called for a broad demonstration in September. Firstly, in Karakas, to ask for speeding up the process so that the withdrawal could take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilized in the capital today.
The government will feel pressure," Eredia said.
On the other hand, Salmanka feels that in this situation it is impossible to wait so long.
"They should respond to the Lusena Communication faster and stronger, as it actually kills a referendum," said expert FNL.
Congressman Eredia acknowledges that some opposition parties want to achieve a more rapid demonstration, but more time is needed for the organization of another group.
The opposition must be cautious at the moment.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the activity in the second signature gathering campaign will be low," said Salamanka.
In order to enable this to be activated, the national electorate, which is almost 4 million people, has to receive support from twenty per cent.
Salamanca and other analysts are convinced that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Šavimus will be delayed.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political changes today.
"If the government closes the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legal opportunities," Eredia said FNL.
In time, LNSC Director A.Pukieti will be released.
On 12 August at the emergency meeting of the House of Commons, the majority of Members supported the resignation of the Director of the LNSC, Ainara Puíšės, from the discharge of duties for the duration of the service examination.
In the near future, it is intended to clarify the conditions of a sports doctor’s visit to his municipality.
In fact, during the visit of the trainer, the LNSC client acquired a headache.
The building is located in the centre of the new sports centre.
In view of the seriousness of the situation and the possible appeal of the client to the court, the Commission was set up by the Vice-President of the House of Commons, Vitas Volontes.
Its task is to carry out a service examination at the Sports Centre and to give an opinion by 16 August this year.
The next Tuesday, it is planned to reconvene the emergency session of the House in order to decide on the next action.
It should be noted that during the particular incident, A.Pokoitis was found at the time of departure.
The Director of the Sports Centre's responsibilities from Friday to the service period shall be the Director's Deputy Director's Training at the work of Oksana Grimalíka-Nazarova.
Orres are sacred sports for the elderly.
Today, the celebrations of the Orgres pensioner company were held at the stadium of the centre of Sport.
In the old stadium, the director of the development work of the Orgres Sports Centre, Sanita Taurin, who had prepared a special program for the members of the Sport.
The individual results will not be assessed at this time, but the participants of the sport will be divided into four teams.
"Each participant's contribution will be paid as a result of the team," explains S.Tourinja.
The participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball fast, the construction of the Eiffel Tower together with a memory game, the staff of the Florbola activities, summer cover.
In order to succeed in all four Christmas programmes disciplines, participants had to carry out the tasks of engagement - the "Sunity Age", the "Rinnō dance", the "Expletnis", and the three staphethes - to work with the horse, to meet the elements of frisbium and Badminton.
All the tasks were prepared in an attractive way, and the athletes did them with joy, joy and satisfaction to comment, others to support others.
A special feeling caused the darkness of summer, which caused the organizers to suffer the costs they had made.
The competitions followed closely with the volunteers of the Orgre’s new Sports Centre, who conducted the tasks, determined the results and ignored the advice.
There was also the Ogres symbol Čiecurus, who inspired the Holy Members of Sport.
The elderly have shown that they are good, attractive, and good in sports.
The green team's representative Peter Zeps spent an eight-minute period in exactly the amendment of the bomb basketball, only for one productive year his team member Janis Staudžs returned.
The pensioners are active in the area.
The bus is always full, and about 300 people enter the halls.
"Two times a week we will meet at the Family Support Centre, where we can play a novel, table tennis, trainers," says the President of the Orgre Pensions Society, Janis Staudžs.
At the end of the sports holidays, all participants received thanks from the Orgres New Centre for the participation, but the greatest benefit is fresh air development, good storage and shared time.
2016/2017 Premierly provided No.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian Journalists predict item 14 (Note: it is not only Alana Smith's forecast, but our journalist's general advice)
Position 14 of the previous season
Appearances to win the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
For the past week it looked after a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will be again fighting for the fun or stagnation, depending on how much "glass" is still more pragmatic tonia pulse.
However, Jeremy Font sold 88% of his club's shares to Guocchian Lai and Pulasam, in a fairly secure hands that the bookmaker immediately made in favor of the first unfathomable release of the manager.
The situation has undoubtedly changed the Balack Country - and not only Hawthorns, but also some of the feelings on the north-easts of Volverhampton, where young Chinese owners have not been able to spend their time, turning their backs on Kenya Jäcket services.
The police, however, confirmed that his work was not immediately threatened, and the company has also expressed its desire not to change the club culture.
"I don't want to change the club's beliefs or start an inconsistency," he said, taking on the responsibilities.
I want to be a good owner and to invest in this club for a long time.
First of all, our goal is to ensure that we stay in Premierly and then go further, I would like to see the club stabilized at the top of the dividends.
I think it's the best deal in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
This is the achievements of Pula, and the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to go up to the top of the table, but to the new owner and the increasingly focused fan base, it will be important to expect a quick presentation on the top of the table to know that this is an extremely difficult task, taking into account the fundamental work that has recently been invested among other teams near the table.
To be more than 14 places in the past season, there will certainly be more work to be done.
Only Aston Villa, which is located in the lake, has a smaller name, and it is worth remembering that the Christmas Albion averaged less than one side by the names in 90 minutes, almost or twice the worst.
They didn't get names for 13 of the 38 games, and put more than one of them in nine games.
Of them 10 won no game won more than one words, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As already expected, a total of 34 letters were received from the standard positions.
There is no wonder that the Hawthorns team was in trouble, possibly most notable after the shocking 0-0 was not separated by Villa at the end of January when the hotel team looked better.
On the other hand, only the six best teams were better in protecting - although no club has been issued to include four centre side guards.
These protections are often not sufficiently assessed, especially by John Evanss, whom you would like to become Arsenal, taking into account the recent crisis of the players.
The international team of Northern Ireland had a great start at the European Championship, and Albion would have to spend a lot of money on selling.
Bens Foster's names are reliable, and they are well integrated in the middle line.
Darens Flechers, a large-scale like Evansam, demonstrated in a large measure that he was still able to play at a high level at the age of 32 and that Claudius Jacob was not appreciated enough.
It is disturbing for all sides that the story of the future of Saido Berahino is still not clear.
In writing the owner's order rates from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected, but they still maintain peace and Mark Hüdz is ready to extend.
After the last season close to the liquidation, it is appropriate for all parties involved to act.
The triggerer, of course, is talented, but, as Paul has said many times, by turning you to one, to the other, for a long time, it has been seen that such relationships do not work.
Albion argues that it is necessary to sign the exchange documents before the former English U-21 member of the U-21 election will go, but his 15 million-year-old tour with Diafru Saho spent a few days before he was transferred to the club claiming that he had gone out of medical check and had all agreed, but he had a magic spell that would mean he would be able to read the beginning of the season.
This causes great pressure on the Venetian of Solomon Rondon, who in the past season had looked very cheap, but he had to improve the supply of his nine names, especially if Ricky Lamberts continued to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Victor Anicébi and Stefan Seseignon also appears retrospectively in the devil.
The pool in its entire career is a great glory with its slow new players driving up and up to three tones - Jonathana Leko, Sama Filda and Taylor Roberts' performance last season in the game with a unique 1-1 with Liverpool, quite or become a norm.
He will return to the already tested and tested, but Leko is worth keeping in sight.
The 17-year-old half-year-old was a total of five games in the previous season, becoming the first-born Premier player in 1999, which is also highly valued in the English youth football system.
Met Philips, with a 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be quick, but he is the only new player who participated in the first weekend of competition.
This would not have been assured if the end could have been quite steady.
"All," said the last couple, Express and Star about what would improve.
Any position you see.
We need to strengthen backgammon players, middle players in the field and players in the previous positions.
The goal is, we know what we want.
They may appear much more difficult than expected, mainly because of a lack of clarity about the acceptance process.
The season could determine how they have started with seven large-scale games before the complex competitions with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
The pressure on Pulis will then be less or less persistent.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will find a new club.
Ta Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue transaction after authorized change in pensions
According to Tata Steel UK, the pension authorities said that the scheme could be restructured without the pension protection fund (PPF) by increasing the company's appearance of closing the rescue transaction.
The British steel industry's pension scheme is a commitment of 15 billion stars and, according to estimates, at least 700 million stars' weight deficit, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of the rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Vels.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of its British business, which employs 11,000 people, ensuring the future after negotiations with the Minister for Economic Affairs and Pension Regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the British business with ThyssenKrupp, the German Conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the UK steel sector pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the retired president of the pension, said that this scheme would avoid PPF if the benefits received by the staff were modified.
Although this is well funded in comparison with other schemes, with a deficit that has been reduced to 300 million stars for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its commitments.
Johnston said that the authorities admitted that it was "not real" to the joint venture or to any Tata Steel Uk who purchased responsibility for the financing of the current and future deficit.
The modification of the benefits resulting from the scheme was much more binding than the addition of the PFF, he added where the workers should accept more favourable conditions.
Tata Steel's sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel users since the negotiations on the future of its British business have been started in March, and it has been believed in the case as a short conversation with the British government.
Košik in Čaterje, the Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said that India's conglomerate wants to make its steel business more "sustainable".
Speaking at a culinary meeting of Tata Steel in India, Čaterj said that negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes were moving ahead, but he argued that the scheme was well funded.
"We speak with various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the German Government, etc.," said Čaterje, reports Times of India.
There is a view that pensions have a known impact on goods such as steel business, so we need to find a structural solution that will not delay business progress.
The mandate of the pension is to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme in support of Tata Steel.
The potential changes in the scheme include addressing how the increase in the annual inflation-based aid is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as limiting future pension payments to the minimum laid down in law.
Johnston adds: "The Commissioner and his advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and pension regulator with evidence of the ability of the scheme to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period and with low risk levels outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not affected the recent market distortion of securities in the same way as other British pension schemes. We are still convinced that the scheme has the ability to provide benefits at an adequate level.
The CBS commentator enjoys Michael Pelpsu and Rainenu Lohti at the end of the competition
The Canadian Broadcasting Organisation CBC Olympics' Commentary on the night of the Thursday night caused a wave of tensions between Michael Filps and his competitor Raienu Lohti.
Eliots Fridmens both enjoyed the entire 200 meters of individual relief during which he won the Felps, cutting off his 22 Olympic gold medal.
When Pelps crossed the line, Fridmen held him as Lohti, the people of Pelpsa, and already the top of the world’s competitors.
And he said, "He will do it."
Raiens Lothht has defeated Michael Felps in this competition!
In fact, phemps could not even go to a nice pedéstala.
However, Felps won, but Lohthe finished fourth.
As soon as Pelps was at the gold, the CBS broadcasts were introduced.
In a wonderful way, he immediately admits his mistake.
I'm sorry, I feel like a road.
Femps with gold," he said.
A Canadian comment, which was widely appreciated after an error, reconnaissanced his error and reconnaissanced observers in doubt within an hour of the event.
I'm sorry.
I'm surprised.
"No justification," he wrote.

Russian hackers attacked the former NATO commander's computer.
Hackeri published the list and data on one of the Sorosa funds.
The same hackers, who may have been carrying out an attack on the US Democratic Party e-mails and published their lists, may also be reluctant in the new attack series, report to the Bloomberg Agency.
Following the information it received, these cybersuppliers attacked the former NATO Commander General Filipa Brídlova's list of European forces and the services of the Open Society Institute, which is part of the millions of projects supported by George Sorosa.
The user has published the information obtained on DCLeaks.com.
There is a list of Brídlova and data on the activities of the Open Society.

The news agency claims that this is about the same hackers that launched the attack on the U.S. Democratic Party computers and led by the Russian spy.
The U.S. Inspectorate has already warned the Congress's senior officials about the possible attack by hackers on the Democratic Party.
The news agency "Reuters" reports that it has information that the inspectors have reported a number of policies at the time - cyberattacks are coordinated by two Russian investigators or controlled organisations.
However, the congressmen were unable to pass this information on to the victims of cybercrime because it was a secret.
The scandal of attacks against the Democratic Party's computers began after about 20 thousand e-mails were published online by the party's representatives during the presidential campaign.
The party's candidate Hilarija Clinton announced that the falsification of these letters was organised by a Russian spy.
The Russian President's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said that Russia is not talking to cyberists.

Two thirds of its inhabitants will have to agree to the smoothing of the house.
If the owners are very expensive and specific about the technical situation of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and build the building in any way possible, then it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is the fact that EU co-financing from this year will be possible for any multi-sanitary house, the only condition is that the building phase needs to be closed.
In the past, only the homes of many people could be used.
The most common cause for home managers is the organisation of meetings of housing owners.
A crucial problem where the process is currently being pursued is that 67% of the residents' consent is needed.
"The previous programme required 51%," says SIA "The Manager of Liepaja's House" (LNA) Project Manager Tom Cyrus.
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because in most of the communities, the number of owners of such housing is not limited," says the project manager Gint Lochmelis, the company's "Home Service APSE" project manager.
The largest housekeepers in Liepa - "Home Service APSE" and LNA, which serves around 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 homes in the new planning period by 2020.
They do not exclude the possibility that at the beginning of the work it will be difficult to convince people to vote on renovations, but the behaviour of the citizens of each project should be improved.
I also needed some bank credit, 76% of the population of the house.
"When talking, explaining what will be - but I will sign it of nature," notes the most energetic buildings in Latvia, the oldest Vita Isalniece.
She agrees with Janus, who also lives in the anointed temple.
Well, it can't be that part thinks, and the other part plus one person doesn't agree.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agree to all the action," said Janis.
The representatives of the financial institutions of the ALTUM have proposed a change of these rules.
They make it clear that 51% of the number of votes in banks is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has been experienced in the past planning period.
The majority of the commercial bank has the necessary proof of the owners of two thirds of the dwelling.
As one of the recommendations for home managers, the Head of the European Union Fund of the Ministry of the Economy, Anda Lagzdiņ, has been able to identify people with existing examples and various benefits that will occur by renovating buildings, such as energy saving.
In his youth, Aaron was long - suffering in the face of his mother’s death.
A potential suicide bomber's arrest operation in Canada was worthy of the pressure film.
It all started when the Canadian police received a video from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, the Canadian Royal Police have received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained a video from the so-called "mocec" video that was recorded by an unknown person who was clearly present at the stage of the final attack.
"And he was preparing to work with a real judge," said Canadian police officer Mike Kabana.
The video recorded a black masked man in English and Arabic spoke threats to Canadians and insisted on referring to all they had done to Muslims.
For about three hours, using the face and voice recognition computer, the Canadian police have been able to get to know this man.
This was 24-year-old Aaron Drevers.
He has already found a trial service to monitor the celebration of the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
The Court ruled that Dreveram was prohibited from doing so further and also from taking part in any radical organisations.
However, the authorities did not until then consider that Drivers could create some physical threat to the environment.
When the police arrived at her home in the city of Strathros in Ontario, the young man was outside and sat at the taxi station.
At that time, the court officials tried to arrest him, but Drivers, sitting on the back seat, had acted as a judge.
To prevent the detonation of another judge, the police called on a new man.
He's dead from the trauma he's caused.
There's no pressure on the cabometer.
A non-terrorist father, Wayne Drevers, told Canadian television that his son had been exposed to Islam in the middle of the 20th century.
This helped him to break free from drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron had a problem with his father, who had been a long - standing rival for his mother’s death.
Only when I heard the video today did I realize how much he had left.
I didn't realize he was so radical.
"And I didn't know he was so good to speak Arabic," said Aaron's father.
The Canadian police recognize - if they had entered a few hours later, the development of events could have been a bit different.
Raděviča to Rio will be a tourist and will support Latvia's facilities.
In a former Olympic and Lightweight Ineta Radévica LTV in the Olympics, seven sportsmen told Laura Ikannieces-Admidinja that the fifth day's performance in the first two disciplines was not bad, given that the athletes were traumatized.
At the same time, Laura had a good foot beat, not a crease.
Radjevica pointed out that this is comparable - just like a person who has the ability to write with a good hand, it would immediately be forced to write with a cross.
Therefore, the outcome of the Inconsistencies-Admidinjas, taking into account the trauma, is not bad.
Raděvica discovered that she had not recently contacted Ikonanici-Admidin, but actively followed her at the beginning and felt with her.
Ineta was informed of Laura’s trauma recently and gave support to the athlete, stating that she did not begin to create her own security mines, but showed a character and a period of fighting.
When talking about other types of sport, Radévica believes that the Olympics are very high, so one of Latvia's sportsmen translates him into Rio de Janeiro as a tourist is wrong.
She remembered that even when she moved to the first Olympics, she was called a tourist, and this led to negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers its beginnings, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results," Radévica opened with her experience in sports.
She told me that it was always important for a person in the tribe to have a man who would give the co-in power.
Even Radévica will be a tourist this year - she will be going to Riodeženiro next week to support Latvian athletes in the camp.
She points out that you will definitely be on a light-lighted competition.
Ineta Radévica won the European Championship in 2010.
In 2004, in the Olympic Games in Athens, she took 13 places in the distance and 20 points in the triangle, but in 2008 she did not start a sportsman because she was waiting for her son.
In London, as already mentioned, Radević was on the 4th floor.
The walls will show the film "Quanta Code" with physicist Kacheev in the main part.
The film annotation says that parallels to the scanning of electrons in the laboratory Kaščejevs are a fan, a teacher, a socially active and urbanly thinking man and father who is looking for connections with Vsvarenno.
In the case of Latvian TV, "Rīta Panorāma" pointed out that taking the film was an interesting experience for him.
I knew about how to go up the movie, how to film it, how to record the sound.
"And really great work," said the physicist.
He admits that the film's been underway for two years.
The biggest difference with the director was the title of the film.
I'm categorically against that name.
No quota code.
"There is no secret which, by reading the film, could be known and is all clear," added the Associated Professor of LU.
Kacheev admits that he likes to have the film at first glance just at Murian's free movie tonight.
They are organised by friends from the "Viegli" fund, and these cinemas will be held every night until 9 September.
Four people were injured in bomb blasts in the tourist areas of Thailand
After the people of Thailand voted for the adoption of the Constitution supported by the military, on Thursdays and Fridays in the five provinces of southern Thailand - in the destinations of popular tourism - a number of bombings took place, where four people were injured and many people were injured.
The first two explosions in the coastal coast of Huahin on Thursday evening, the next Friday morning.
The city is about 200 miles [200 km] south of Bangkok.
The police reported that in the first sentence, one woman was injured and 20 people were injured, 10 of them being aliens.
The authorities confirmed that other developments in the cities of Phuket, Tran and Suratthān in the south.
Two bombs forced Pūketa to enter Paton and two more in Phhana Province - in the region of tourism to the north of Phūketa.
In the last 24 hours, 11 bombs have been dropped in Thailand.
On Friday, the Royal Police officer of Thailand, Kristana Patanachareans, announced that the explosion was not related to Islamic extremists and is considered to be local saboteur acts.
"There's still to make conclusions," he said.
"But we are absolutely certain that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, that's actually a local level suicide, and we're trying to find the victims."
On 12 August 2016, after a small power bomb explosion in Huhai, the investigators collected evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people were killed in the bomb explosions in the major tourism areas of Thailand. The competent authorities tried to establish a motive and find the victims.
There is no conflict in the country as a result of which terrorists could be found in the country.
"Therefore we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet taken responsibility for the attack and the competent authorities have not challenged any specific group, but the resolution took place on the same week when the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phūketa and Phhanna - rejected the military-supported referendum, and in the provinces of southern Thailand where most of the people are Muslims, more than 6500 people have been injured since early 2004.
The events took place on the day of the birth of the king of Thailand, which is the day of the national festival in Thailand.
The city of Klai Kangwon is located in Huahai, or "a long way from the roots" where the Thai royal family often lives.
King Bumibols Aduljade was the longest monarch in the world.

Porgius and Besa, which we have already won!
There are a lot of operations that have never been performed in Latvia.
It's very rare.
However, it seems ironic that since the 17th century, George Géršvina opus Porgis and Besa has not been studied or rescanned, unless it is counted as a chrestomatic solo number such as the Summertime periodical survey on viewers (including the summer festival of Ines Galantes).
That is why - since Latvia is a civilized country in the Western world, it is bound by the rules of the family of Gheršvina and the licenses of copyright in respect of Portugal and Besu until 2030.
The harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, during the course of the full study, the author wanted all 14 students to be black people.
In Latvia, of course, the ongoing discussions and contexts of the United States of America in the field of race are somewhat known and the wish of the composer would be difficult.
The concert carried out by the compromise was held by four artists of melancholy melancholy Americans and their Latvian amateur brothers and sisters on the 6th of August, reminiscent of the music of the Czech Art Festival on 10th of July, in the remembrance of the music of Gheršvina, in which its classical music traditions with American poetry rhythms, games, the 20th century fashions and the hemispheres of the early 20th century, portraying the beautiful Ubaya Prussian and the beautiful Besas art of music in that musical quality that would have filled the record of the life stories of the music.
First, because of LNSO and Director Andra Pogas.
For a hard-to-consultly difficult venue in the open spaces of the city of Céssa, the orchestra is located near the view of the sun and the sound (and great dance!) race While, the overall scan was stylistically nansted, contrasted with rich and precise both strong and metal instruments and the piano party (Martínš Zilberts).
Second, they're clear because of the team.
The charismatic dramatic baritones, Lester Linčs (Portugal), is a popular singer in Europe and America, whose repertoire has both baritone and Basbaritone parties, particularly in the Valdi operas.
Portugal has played an unprecedented role, and more often Kraunu - he feels like a fish in this opera and has also encouraged viewers even to wake up in concerts the suffering of the poor people’s emotional climate of solidarity.
In his second Portuguese and Bessa concert carried out by Latvia (the first event in 2012 was no more, not less than with the Berlin Philharmonics and serum Simon Retlu) opened as a vital plastic combination of different vocal styles with dramatic tones and fantastic pianos at the top register.
She is no longer one of the most beautiful of today's Aids.
For an attractive German-born tennis player, Jeremy Smith, whom Andris Boga once referred to in the Boston study, the role of a drug dealer in Sportinlaifa is a company in four continents.
In it he shows his synchronous performance and singing skills as a well-trained musician.
Smits is one of the rare sightings in which the voice seems to still conceal unopened vocal opportunities as before 15 years ago when the opera voice has not been found, trying to seduce the young.
It is unlikely that even from row 24 and relatively dark German Smita’s eloquent tongue allows her to swallow a mixture of garbage in her hands even if it is not there at all.
How can Besa not follow such a mefistophilic liar who, in an empty place, gives the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The crown was a symbol of the temple’s temple dedicated to Rodney Clarks.
The greatest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team in the Czech study was Sonora Vaices, the famous top register of Sirina, a skilled balance between the spoken and sung text, according to changing the voice position, the vocal acrobatics and dramatism of both Sirina's prayers in My Man is Gone Now, and the Stylized President's general prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
In the classroom, the voice of Margaritas Wilson was well chosen, but at the beginning of Summertime, the symphony was quite a bit noise and nervous, with its real character gained in the repression.
The colors and colors were produced by the parties entrusted to Mihallam Čulpajev, Rihard Mačanovski, Andrim Lapinj (especially by the seller of Krabje placed on the walls of the city, Irmas Pavar was responsible for the excellent sales of the land.
Written by Ilonas Bagelles, Richard Miller, Emila Kivleneek, as well as in the speeches delivered by Ivo Martinsona, a researcher and a white lawyer in the form of Arčdeil, an unexpected director and actor of the Cessian festival, and Juris Žagars.
At the concert hall of the village of Kariša in the spatial concept, the choirs worked on the steps, mostly on the prosthesis, sometimes by climbing or walking on the steps.
In sufficient dynamic activity, a small number of commissions were made in the hands of the Latvian soldiers.
Its existence is entirely a procedural explanation.
First, some soloists played several episodes (sometimes it was difficult to track their visual identity).
Secondly, there are many dialogues in Portugal and Bessa, where I would like to ask for phrases, a reply that is easier to follow.
The ears of the audience were deeply moved by the operation of the railway station in Cessius, which was a great help to the titre machine.
The weather was over and the first part of the concert took a very long time.
However, it did not stop most of the audience to stay until the end to attract artists.
Nine o'clock in the evening, there is quite a start time for full-time operations, especially if it is expected to be a long way from Cessium, but the opera Porgij and Besa have returned to Latvia’s musical apricots and will probably become one of the most exciting musical experiences of this summer.
Also in Liepa, where it emerged at night and in all other acoustic conditions.
In the Rīga game field, the man feared children with a fever.
On the evening of 11 August, about eight o’clock at night, the State police received a report from an audited child’s parents who had been delayed by the fact that there was a man in the village of Lomonosova, where the children were in fear.
The lawyers immediately responded to the call and the incident, where they also met this man with a fever, which was a very large amount of alcohol at the time of the incident - 3.07 prom.
It was made clear that in 1962, a man who was born was already breast - feeding his children so that they would not grieve.
This time, however, an aggressive man used a bullet that was placed under the child’s care.
The man was arrested.
In the context of the incident, a criminal process has been launched on the deterioration of the social order which appears to be in obvious danger to society or in ignorance, ignoring accepted standards of conduct and disrupting human peace.
Such offences shall be punishable by the deprivation of liberty for a period of up to two years or by the withdrawal of temporary freedom, or by forced labour, or by the punishment of money and by the supervision of the trial for a period of up to three years.
The presidents of the Federation usually use guest accreditations in Olympic games.
The presidents of the sports federations usually enter the Olympic Games place for a few days and use the guest accreditations that may change their names, so there are several owners during their competitions, the LETA reported to the agency to the representative of the Latvian Olympics (LOV) by Marita Vilcina.
On the third day, a large number of asylum seekers came to the attention of the Olympic coach Allonas Ribakova, Germana Jakubovsk, who discovered that the last time the trainer had decided to go to Riodezáneiro Olympics to the Latvian Federation of Pledging (LPF), the leader of Kaspars Pone, while the trainer was to stay at home.
Later, it became known that Mr. Brasilia had come up with a trainer's accreditation, which the president himself gave a surprise because "now there is no one inside."
As told by Vilcina, only two presidents of the Federation - Pone, as well as the leader of the Latvian Vieglatlattic Union (LVS), have lived in the city of the Olympic Games in London.
Sportsmen live in the Olympic City, as well as the official persons involved, such as coaches, doctors, delegation administration.
Similarly, it is likely that in London Ponem, there was a trainer accreditation.
"The former federation presidents enter as guests, and their accreditations are changed - enter into a few days and then another one is used," Wilcina said, explaining that the federation president is not even living in the Olympic city.
Mr. Riodezáneiro has already arrived at the end of July and will leave Brazil on 13 August, so he will most likely be there from all the presidents of the national federation.
It is unlikely that Latvia's opening-up to the strike started only one day on August 10th.
Latvia will be represented in 11 sports in the Olympic Games in Latvia, and the LETA calculations show that six or seven federations will take the most important competitions every four years.
The medicine will take place in Brazil on Saturday, the President of the Latvian Ritengreukting Federation (LRF) Igo Japinš will be at the BMX competitions scheduled for next week, the Latvian Windserfing Federation President Ansis Dále on Riodežaniiro planned to fly on August 16, when Ketija Birzulei is already closed, but the Latvian Chinese Federation President Dintars Urbančiks - the day before.
Also, the next week, President Karlis Krēslinz of the Latvian Saching Federation was planning to enter, when the launch of this Danish Upelnik has already been completed.
The Latvian Federation President Raimonds Rublovskis at least during the Latvian sports competitions did not find Riodežanero, although his appearance was planned, the Latvian Federation is not currently president, but the Latvian Olympic Committee continues to be involved in the conflict and its sportsmen are at the international competitions of Latvia.
Until the President of the Latvian Federation of Volyebola Atis Sausnitis and the leader of the Latvian Union of Tennis, Juris Savickis decided not to take part in Riodezáneiro.
Vasilev evaluates the natural breast of Latvian women.
The world-class Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, scriptographer, book author, lecturer and collector Alexander Vasiljevs has been very often visited in Latvia over the past year.
Recently, he finalised "Miss and Mysters Latvia 2016" competitors and recognized that Latvia's role in contrast with Russia's share of sex can be favored with natural breasts and lips that are not improved with silicon and botulin injections.
In a conversation with "Vakara News", Alexander Vasiljevs reported that for years, the president of the jury has been in the popular "My Russia" concert.
That is why he also took a keen interest in the assessment of the "Miss and Mysters Latvia 2016" participants.
Looking at how different Latvian beauty competition standards differ from similar competitions in Russia, Vasiljevs stressed that Latvia and the Russians have a completely different figure: "Russia beauty contesters have a lower strength than Latvian competitors."
However, young Latvians are well dressed and groomed and can also be beautiful with natural beauty, not with plastic surgery.
This is why I particularly congratulate the Latvian parties on their natural beauty.
With regard to its professional activity in Latvia, Vasilijev has many plans.
The exhibition of the fashion historian's collection "The Applied Nature" is currently seen in the Decorative Art and Design Museum.
In Ventspil, in the Lebanese Order, Vasiljeva exhibition "Cazu Tower 1860-2010".
Vasilev was so impressed by Ventspil that he also spent a few days enjoying the city’s hospitality and taking steps along the sea.
I like Latvia very much.
It is especially now that there is a threat of terrorism across Europe, here is a real paradise storm.
"In Latvia, spending time and rest is a good thing," admits the fashion guru.
In addition, on November 23, Aleksandr Vasiljevs opened a private fashion museum.
Please help!
We ask our son, brother, to take care of the baby.
We, Rinalda’s family, are grateful for the wonderful people around us and for God’s ability to save Rinalda, but, unfortunately, it is not now possible to fully report medical costs to their own strength.
Ronald Grinbergs is 11 years old and has been diagnosed with brain tumors at the end of July.
This year he graduated from the 4th class of Milzkalne at the beginning of high school, a strong sportsman and a very talented artist.
It's like everything helped him.
A healthy, healthy, independent, eager and active child.
Always funny and slow.
On July 26, our family will remember forever.
In the last few weeks, he was bedridden with nausea, headaches, but his doctor wanted him to have a brain tumor.
And at first, they thought it was, too.
Because someone might have thought that such "unsanitary" symptoms at the waist are much more serious than the mind is not understood.
The diagnosis received on 26 July - Rinaldam is a major brain tumor.
The rapid storage fluid in the head of the brain, but everything that your doctor may help in Latvia is to perform a healing operation to modify the fluid of the fluid of the fluid of the fluid, as it is not practically available for direct surgical operation.
Also, it cannot be determined whether the plant is good or bad.
The following state-funded plan: start shooting and see what's going on.
It's like being in such a bad mood - we're going to experiment with you, we're going to study the results.
The results of Rinalda's studies were successful in showing a doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice-President of the World Neurosurgery Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgery.
He accepted an operation and showed that he had to operate immediately.
The brain causes a tremendous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the plant is good or bad to develop plans for further treatment.
The parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
On August 8, Ronald was in Spain with his mother, Eviu, and was operated on August 9th.
A very difficult operation was performed for more than 6 hours.
The operation was performed in Santa Elena's clinic.
The outputs removed most of the plant, reduced the pressure, obtained samples of analysis.
Rinalds are already on the way from the bed and as a good half-way, asking for evening potatoes.
The results of oncological analysis should be expected now.
Thanks to Dr. Araeza and the management of a clinic that understood the situation and operated immediately without receiving a full prior treatment fee.
They hoped that the remaining amount would be paid only EUR 10 000 for the first contribution in order to operate and save Rinalda's life.
6 000 euros for parents were spent selling techniques, but the other amount needed for road expenses, housing, hospital initial contributions were taken away from radios and friends.
But at least EUR 24 000 is still needed to determine the first treatment phase in Spain and to pay the money we have borrowed for the first contribution.
Please help us reimburse Rinalda's health so important, surgery.
Each euro is important in order to help cover the costs of the operation already carried out and to enable Rinalda to continue its treatment successfully.
The negative signs in Ukraine raise the question: What is Vladimir Putin's advice?
We have been able to discuss the truth of this statement.
Ukraine prohibits them, whereas the United States and the European Union argues that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has identified some signs of six-day pollution, but very little to stop Moscow's major plans.
Russia is known for distorting or misinterpreting events for political purposes, in particular because of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
In the past year, Ukraine's opposition forces have broken down the power stations that have been operating with the Crimea, and some of them have also been involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempt to strike in Crimea remains a topical issue, although there is little basis for the belief that the Ukrainian Government would sponsor a scenario of such events.
In any case, the opening picture of the open-ended analysis shows that Russia has continued to increase its military presence since at least six days ago - before an attack was expected.
These include the movement of heavy weapons on the side, including rail systems intended for the protection of the coast.
Remarkablely known Russian essulation
In particular, reports show that Russia’s forces in Crimea had already been planning a rotation that could help explain activities, although it would be very bad that it was just expected to take place in one of the most complete times since the annex 2014.
In spite of what has become known at the end of the week, Mr Putin will no doubt be more concerned with Ukraine, choosing to use this episode to the extent that it would also be for a greater purpose.
The analysts point to the disturbing parallels with how Russia held directly before the previous military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar talks and military maneuvers were ensured to free members of the Crimean opposition to take a side that was still controlled by Ukraine only to discover that they were indeed the Russian special units that started military occupation.
In August when Russian-supported separatists did not exercise their powers across the border, Putin warned them that they might need the "protection" of the Russian civilian population in Ukraine, which he said was attacked.
He organized an aid package for the region, which, according to NATO information, was only a barrier to Russia’s invasion power.
What is Mr Putin's plan to do in Crimea?
Some commented on whether Moscow only plans another military invasion.
Wars in Eastern Ukraine have been slowed down, just as it was before the attack in August 2014.
But this seeming parallel could be this point when it is intended to introduce fear from military action rather than from actual action - it brings Putin short-term relations with Ukraine and Western countries.
Marks Galeoti, professor of New York University who studied Russia, pointed out that Crime would be of little importance as a point from which to start military action against Eastern Ukraine, which is limited to Russia's eastern part, not Crime, and that the other country is better protected.
"There is a very small chance if the Russians really plan a large amount of offensive," said Mr. Galeoti.
We can soon "be able to observe classical Russian strategies in creating pressure."
The international peace talks on Ukraine, which was once the mechanism with which Putin's contacts with the leaders of the West, who ignored him because of the crisis, are increasingly viewed as ineffective and unrealistic.
By suggesting that there is a threat of a conflict that can happen again, Putin gives new meaning to the negotiations: perhaps his legacy from the silent mouth.
"There is standard Putin tactics - he wants to try to start from a strong position," Galeito said about the next peace talks planned at the beginning of September.
"And the only strong part is to say, "If I wanted, I could do everything more, much worse."
To reach agreement with the Courts
Putin also said this week that during the crisis, there was no significant point in continuing the negotiations by letting the other parties convince him to return to the table and go to the centre of the process.
What does that really give him?
First of all, it allows Russia to continue to strengthen as a world power, although its economic size is smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it is in the position of Moscow as a legal person with regard to Ukraine's sovereignty, to a certain extent by maintaining the country in Russia's control.
This can also be a good thing for Putin for long long long long long long long-term expectations for a broad agreement with the United States, which would resolve its disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, with the conditions favourable to Moscow, of course, also ending the Western sanctions against Russia.
This objective has been repeated several times since the deterioration of the national economy in 2014, mainly due to a decrease in national oil and gas exports.
Since the attack in Syria in the past autumn, he has repeatedly called on the West to join him in a great coalition against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may consider it necessary to provide such an agreement before the end of President Obama's mandate in January.
The Russian authorities are of the view that the next president will be Hillary Clinton, which is more favourable to Moscow.
Donald J. Tramps, although he is friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
In contrast, Obama is considered to be the one "seeking solutions, not conflicts," Galeoti said.
Thus, it is wise to close the window of opportunity to make sure that something is done quickly.
Until a broad agreement is not reached, Putin appears to have been satisfied with maintaining a poor Russian neighbor by saying what will happen next.
In the earlier edition of this letter, the year Russia invaded the Crimea from Ukraine was wrong.
This happened in 2014, not in 2013.
At the convention on the street, the White House turned its weapons against the Zika virus
On the fourth day, the Obama administration said it would turn 81 million US dollars from biomedical research and anti-navigation and health care programmes to pay for vaccines against the development of the Zika virus by turning to emergency measures because the Congress did not approve new funding for the fight against virus.
Silvia Metjūsa Barvela, Secretary of Health and Human Services, wrote to the Congress that the National Institute for Health and Advanced Research and Development of Biomedicine will remain free of money to combat skin disease by the end of the month.
Therefore, it is important to stop the development of vaccines at an important time, by increasing the number of cases of Zíka disease in the country.
In the United States last week, 7,350 cases of Zíka virus were recorded, mostly in Puerto Rico (in accordance with disease control and prevention data).
Ms. Barbara said that 15 infants were born with birth defects related to Zika virus.
The virus may cause brain development anomalies and other serious defects in pregnant mothers.
The spread of disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were registered at the end of last month, has increased the political rate of the federal government's reaction.
The second day, Hillary Clinton stopped in Vainvud, Miami, where the local level was observed to transfer the number of Zika virus cases, and pressed the Congress to return from its five-week suspension to confirm emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have been at a standstill on the issues of the Zika virus for the most part of the year.
In February Obama requested an emergency funding of $1.9 billion.
The Republicans stopped it by requesting more detailed reports on what money will be used.
For months, legislators have argued about how much money should be given and how much should be spent.
In the past month, democracy blocked the review of the action proposed by the Republicans when $1.1 billion was given to fight against the Zika virus but included conditions prohibiting the allocation of funds for family planning to ensure contraceptives in relation to a virus that can be transferred to a sex cell.
Because of this stroke, the White House was obliged in April to devote $589 million to the war against Ebola virus, against the Zika virus. About two thirds of the funding is intended to be used within the country.
On Thursday, Mrs. Barvelav said that her department had spent most of its money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The failure to make a decision on emergency funding to fight the Zika virus has allowed the administration to choose between the rest of the major vaccine development work and the creation of other valuable national programmes to avoid it in time," wrote Barvela.
Democrats have been given this notification in order to transmit to the Republicans an additional amount of money to the war against the Zika virus.
At the press conference, the representative of Ninsia Pelosi from California, the leader of the minority, called on the representative of Paul D.Raien, the Member of the House of Representatives, to remind the Congress of the continuation of this measure.
"All the opportunities have been exhausted, and now we are addressing the National Health Institute," said Mrs. Pelosi.
Mr Raine said that the shift of funds was a step that had to be taken long ago and that Obama's administration had failed to put the problem of Zika's virus at the top of the political benefits.
Last week, the National Health Institute announced that vaccines have begun clinical trials with 80 people with Zika virus, and that the second phase "Zika virus epidemic countries" was launched in early 2017.
However, as the officials claimed on Thursday, an additional funding study will cease without delay.
Barvela said she would turn against the Zika virus against $34 million from the National Health Service, intended for the search of medicines to treat other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Another 47 million more will be listed for the Biomedicine Advanced Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of medicines and vaccines in response to emergencies in the public health field.
This money will come from several accounts, including $19 million from the programme in which small-scale households are entitled to care, and $4 million from the material dependency programmes, such as opioid dependence.
Even as Barvela said, with additional money will only be five in the next month when the agencies are going to "mainly disrupt their action" in the fight against the Zika virus if Congress does not.
In the last four months, the Disease Control and Prevention Centre has spent 60 million dollars to help the states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their preparedness for Zika virus and plans to fight against it, and $16 million to help it develop data recovery systems to quickly detect microcephalia and other symptoms associated with Zika virus.
Thailand's leader links attacks to tourist destinations with constitutional changes
On Friday, the leader of Thailand’s dogs called on the public to be patient until the researchers discovered that the number of fatal bomb explosions that took place in Thailand last week.
General Prajuts Čan-Oča, the leader of the dog and the prime minister, said that the criminals had been "bad people" protesting against the new Constitution, which was approved by the voters in the referendum on Sunday.
"There are still bad people, and they were already working before the referendum," he spoke to the people.
The bomb blasts took place in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Huahai, between the tourist destinations, killed four and wounded people.
The authorities claim that the fires of fires in another country are related.
Analysts claim that the goal of the bomb explosion was not to kill many people, but to harm the tourism sector, one of the outstanding points of the Thailand economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were attacked in Huanhin.
"In order for some to be motivated, explosives and fire-fighting attacks, the dog claims that the post-reference situation will be stable," said Sunajs Fasuk, an organisation's oldest researcher Human Rights Watch.
These attacks have led to the distributive effects of power institutions, terrorizing society and harming the tourism sector on the basis of the economy.
Photo of Thailand's rescue services staff are taking care of the bomb on Friday in the explosion in Huhai.
The police claim that in their view these developments are not related to international terrorism or to the slow-downs of Islam in southern Thailand.
They consider attacks on "local character satellites" rather than terrorism.
A strong political symbol for the time and place of the chosen attack.
The events occurred on the fifth day when the people were ready to celebrate the birth of the king of Syria, which is thought to be the day of the Festival of Booths in Thailand.
Four events took place in Huaihi, a city of the Caribbean, about 125 south of Bangkok, where the majority of the victims were also injured.
The Constitution prepared by the militarists will reduce the influence of political parties and give the military greater powers even if the government is again in control of civilians.
Hunta helped to ensure its victory without allowing opposition to campaign against it.
Murejs Híberts, a South-East Asian expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, pointed out to the military's suspicion that the attacks had been carried out by people who were not satisfied with the vote.
The events were "precisely coordinated, but the eyes were clearly intended for the creation of fear and confusion, not for mass destruction and damage and injury," he said.
Last year, 20 people, mostly tourists from China, were killed at the popular church of Erevan in Bangkok.
Thailand’s officials were bound by the charges against Uighur, who were not satisfied with more than 100 Ugaroos returning to China.
The General Bureau, which has been taking the lead since 2014 when civil government was established, said that this week's tragedy "increased the hearts of the natives."
Why is it now that the country gets better when it gets better in the economy and the tourism sector gets better?" he said.
We need to ask why and what they did.
Green Reaction: How Simones Manuel's historical miracle appeared
This time, at the start of the war, I try to remove the weight of the black township that is something that I don't have with myself simply to stand in that position.
I hope, however, that this will be all right.
I am more than happy about the fact that I can serve others for inspiration and, hopefully, differentiating this kind of sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to be the day when we have more, and it is not Simone, a blacksmith, because the sign of a blacksmith makes it look like I shouldn't be able to cut gold medals or that I shouldn't be able to review records.
This is not because I worked as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and I want to win the same as everyone else.
War on students - lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (L.G.B.T.) - protection in Colombia
Two years ago, 16 years ago, Sergio Urrego moved away from the shopping center in Bogota before leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook by quoting Pink Floyd the song "Goodbye Cruel World" ("Ardieving Bad World").
His death was the beginning of the protests that took place in Colombia last week, where the rights of L.G.B.T. were seen in the wider political wars that have divided the country into two camps.
After his death Urrego's mother, Alba Reijesa, filed a complaint against school officials, accusing them of excluding her only child when it was discovered that she and her classmates had had intimate relations.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia gave her a favourable ruling calling on schools throughout the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a legal victory for the movement of gay rights in Colombia.
However, this week they were fighting for equality with the barrier because the Minister of Education, who is open to gay, received a scandal regarding the application of this provision on the scandal.
The scandal began when social media began to round out the content of pornography, telling people that it was part of the literature published by the Ministry of Education.
Perdia did it to the atoms.
Although the Ministry also offered school assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with a view to helping them pay attention to the regulation, it did not try to emphasize the standardized rules.
"What we want for schools is a tool for resolving conflicts," said Mrs. Perdodias in the interview on Thursday.
The discussions began before the national debate on the future in a country where peace talks between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or the FARC, were held.
The political coalition and the Catholic Church leaders in the Government's opposition have been very rapidly mobilized, accusing President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting a gender union and gender change.
In order to make everyone more difficult, the government delegation participating in the negotiations with the FARC in Havana recently reached agreement on gender and the equality of L.G.B.T., with which the Government is invited to adopt more inclusive policies.
The government's criticism and peace negotiations, which took place 42 years for the old Perdija, the Colombian policy-making star.
They have demonstrated in the games the parades and some have also threatened to resort to violence against him and his partners, Sesylya Alvaresa-Correa Glen, former trade minister.
Peradija maintained all the obstacles for a whole week of peace, trying to correct the mistake and to resume the debate under constructive conditions.
"Something what leaves me standing and keeping my head clear is the knowledge that there are children who will only be discovered," she said.
This is a very complicated field of work and a very unique time.
She also pointed to the link between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
As the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of the FARC transaction, which would be a point of reference for the earthquake in the country, they must consider the origin of the conflict, she said.
"You are a peaceful country that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it the one in which everyone has the same opportunities?" she asked.
Even though she was not pleased to have the goal of ridicule and transfer this week, she is happy that today there are good students in Colombia who can take an example from her and think that they can also try some day to become ministers.
"I am very important that they are calm and know that they can fully realize their potential," said Mrs. Perdia.
We can't expect a new suicide to start to change something.
Keep a vote - The New York Times
"ASV is looking for ways to keep hackers together from the elections" (information, August 4th)
Minister for Internal Security George Johnson said that the Obama administration was thinking of further protection of the security of the national election system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
In various statements and recent disclosure that the external forces, perhaps national countries, are increasingly interested in the impact of our elections, require the federal government to pay additional attention to our choice of systems and possibly consider them part of our country's important infrastructure.
Johnson should immediately contact the thousands of national jurisdictions that help to make the election and to offer assistance, advice and management to the Department of Homeland Security.
As long as our voting infrastructure is varied and the various nature of the effort to ensure it, it sends us a message that the process must begin as soon as possible.
The writer, a democracy from Mississippi, is a member of the National Security Committee.
A son in Pennsylvania in a wheelchair, a third case already this week in a parking lot
The fourth day, hiding from the castle, the funeral of a boy was taken to the Pittsburgh hospital. The emergency relief service and the park officials say this is the third incident this week in the United States detention parks where the children were injured.
A child whose name is not revealed was transferred to a child hospital in Pittsburgh, about 50 miles (80 km) west of the Aidlwailda and Soukzona attractions park in Laidzónjär, Pennsylvania, said the representative of the quick relief services in the Westmoreland area.
A three - year - old son who had been visiting with his brother while he was being helped on site was aware of the fact that a representative of the park, Jeff Krushørs, was e-mailed.
The Krushhurs said that the "Rollo Coaster" attraction will be closed at the time of the investigation.
For children with disabilities, at least 3 feet (91 cm) lengths should be available in a wheelchair, and those who are shorter than 4 feet (122 cm) should be adults.
The attraction, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938 and the Department of Agriculture of the State indicated that it was checked in August.
The hospital representative of the daughter’s health comment on her refusal.
On Sunday, a 10 - year - old son died of a car accident that took him from the world’s highest water level in Kansas, Kansas.
On the first day of the hospital, three 6, 10 and 16-year-old girls, who were separated from more than 30 feet (9 m) high, reported local media during the changing traffic in Grenville, Tennessee.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe Second World War will not visit a shrine in honor of a war-torn memory: Jiji
The news agency Jiji reports that Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abbe Japan's statements in the Second World War will not visit an antiquated Tokyo shrine in which the memory of the war is celebrated.
On Thursday, Jiji reported that Abe, however, planned to send Jasukoni to the Christmas ritual gift for the year.
The festival also commemorates 14 Japanese soldiers who are judged only as war criminals, and China and South Korea consider it a symbol of the Japanese royal military.
Both have not visited the shrine since December 2013 when he announced that he visited to show respect for those who care for his family.
In the new Japanese Defence Minister Tomomi Inada has not answered the question of whether she will visit the shrine, explaining that it is a matter of conscience.
Inda - close to the Abe public and a supporter of Japan's pacifist constitution - has regularly visited Yasukoni in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that Minister Masahiro Imamura of the reconstruction of the areas affected by the disaster in Japan visited the shrine on Thursday and said he was praying for peace and prosperity in Japan.
The relationship between China and Japan, the two largest economies in Asia, has become stronger after the increasing protection of China's coastal coast and the presence of other countries' warships near the South China Sea, which is called Sankaku, but in China, for the Diaouds.
Two suspects in the Rio Olympics plan terrorist acts: police
The fourth day, the police stopped two people who were suspected of supporting the Islamic State in planning a possible attack on the Olympic Games during the Riodzejaneiro.
Before the fourth day, the operation police had already arrested 12 people, all suspected of cooperating with the Islamic state prosecutors.
The Brazilian Federal Police report that three more persons were understood and subsequently released.
Both Thursdays are arrested in Brazil, but the police do not disclose their names and other information.
Although the history of Brazil has not been in conflict with known gangs of warriors, the Government reports that the Olympic Games have made the country more targeted, in particular because of the participation of countries fighting against the Islamic state.
They control certain territories of Iraq and Syria, and the US-led coalition has launched an air attack on them.
The group is supported worldwide by victims of civilisation and exploitation.
An official complaint is filed against a newly suspected French priest
In the past month, during the investigation of the hypocrisy of the French priest against the men arrested earlier, a formal complaint was filed on Friday, and Reuters reported the source of information to the police.
In his 21-year-old suspects, research on terrorist cooperation has been carried out, and he has planned to attack people, the source of information said.
The man was on the phone with Adel Kermić and Abdeu Malik Petitdjan, who stopped the church service at St.
Both police stopped.
The suspect had left his home, located near Tuluza, on St.
The new man who had not previously been criminally punished realized that he had spent the night there, but told the investigators that he was on the move the next day because he had not had a good relationship with Kermicu and Petitjan, the source of information said.
Researchers were trying to determine whether Kermić and Petitjan were participants in France and whether they were associated with the Islamic State that has taken responsibility for the attack.
At the end of last month, Petitjan’s brother was sentenced to trial before trial.
Doruss de Vriess before moving to Celtic for medical examination
Nottingham Forest Club värtssargs Doruss de Vriess went to Glazgo, because he wants to conclude an agreement on moving to Celtic.
De Vriess was tattooed, and we went to Roshol's hospital before medical examination after Hoops agreed on conditions with Sky Bet Chempion's club.
The head of the park club, Brendan Rodgerss, is looking for the protection of the experienced centre to present the first number of Crete Gordon competition.
However, Rogers was 35 years old at the age of Vriesam because he worked with the Dutch at Swansea Club together.
He played 51 games in Swansea's composition, which in 2011 he was entitled to move to Premierlugu.
He has changed the shape of the wild to add "Vilkie", and has been City Ground since 2013.
During his career, he also played in Scotland after the Dunfermline season, after his return in 2006.
His stay in the Eastendpark ended with a pregnancy, however, by surviving a double agonist, being "sended to a trimda" from the highest level before losing Celtic Scotia.
According to the contract, there was still a year's stay in the Forest, and Celtic was reported to have to pay only a nominal fee in order to become his signature.
Macy's gonna lock up 100 stores.
The Great Giant Macy's Thursday announced its plans to close 100 businesses, which is a dramatic step towards helping the business chain to face potential cumulative problems: America, it claims, is a free online shopping area too many.
Macy's regularly reduces its business portfolio, often spending several pounds on less profitable business immediately after a year's free drink.
However, in the light of its summer announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 trading venues, business chains, it seems to have taken a much more aggressive position than that of many representatives of the retail sector with regard to the reduction in the number of their businesses by adjusting the very variable purchasing environment.
Farmers and buyers give the wind to Macy's business in New York.
The retail giant announced that it is planning to close 100 businesses.
Macy's has many reasons to try to change what: many of its shops are located in the smaller regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has particularly affected the demand for e-commerce.
In general, the high-quality category has been more difficult, as buyers will increasingly choose less price traders, such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion workers such as H&M.
These factors, leading to short-term difficulties such as the ever-increasing cost of international tourism and the inadequate weather conditions that Macy's has established in an unstable situation that has grown more than a year ago.
On Thursday, the company reported that its relative sales volume in the last quarter had fallen by 2.6 per cent, the entire weak indicator, which was nevertheless an improvement, taking into account very bad 6.1 per cent of the year's crisis, which was found in the previous quarter.
A retailer's income was $5.87 billion (Canadian dollar $7.64 billion), by 3.9 per cent less than in this period.
Macy's said that the closure of the business would cost it about $1 billion in the year's turnover.
And the closure of such a large number of businesses could be considered to be the recognition of the cause of the retailer at the same time.
However, the company’s share value dropped by 17 per cent on Thursday, which shows that the investor is considered to be a proactive measure which is sent to Macy’s stronger future.
In my opinion, because Macy's reduces the number of businesses, it shouldn't be surprising.
Mr Lundgren, Director-General of the Small Trader, has already said that there is too much business in the chain.
At the highest level, the managers said that they have adopted a new strategy, with a special emphasis on 150 of its most profitable businesses, trying to achieve greater sales in already profitable trading sites.
Jeff Janete, Director of Macy's, who has been appointed in place of Lundgren since 2017, said in his statement almost all the companies that the company is planning to close are those in which sales volumes and revenues fall to the ground.
"We are aware that in these places of trade we are not yet able to obtain adequate return from investments, and often there is not a level of buyers' purchasing experience that reflects our efforts in connection with Macy's brand," said Janet.
The company announced that it would be listed in the list of business to be closed later.
Macy's said that we still have a decision on closed companies and that therefore we don't know exactly how many employees will be released.
The retailer is not completely out of the main markets where he is currently active, but he is thinking of closing the shops that are less active.
This route will not always be suitable for the purchase center managers, who will account for large customers such as Macy's, so that their purchase centres will be connected and maintained by other smaller businesses.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, milk from refilled bottles can be "more bad than slowing down your dog's wheelchair", taking into account how many bacteria you will encounter.
The Home Page Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to check 12 four different kinds of water bottle - with a swirling corner, with a left corner, with a pressure frame, and with a salmine.
Each bottle was used for weeks without washing.
Your refilled water bottle may be as dirty as a dog's wheelchair.
"On the basis of the 12 of our checked water bottles, we have found that there may be a considerable number of viable bacteria cells in the reuses: more than 300,000 colonies forming units per square centimetre (KVV/kv.cm.), says Treadmill Reviews.
In bottles with abandoned containers, the maximum amount of microb was found for more than 900 000 colonies forming units per square centimetre (CVV/kv.cm.)
The bottles had microbes that could cause skin infections, pneumonia or bleeding.
Bottles with strong corrugors were the worst of 162 000 KVV/kv.cm., but the train with propellers contained only slightly less than 160 000 KVV/kv.cm.
"Dert water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your pet's pain," is indicated on the home page.
The best quality is observed for bottles with salmon, in which only part of the bacteria in the other bottles were found - only 25 KVV/kv.cm.
This could be because the water runs up to the top of the forest, not to the edges of it, and thus to attach the moisture to the lovely microbes.
Microbes with salmon are described as "increasing safely."
"On the basis of our test results, it is recommended that we select bottles with salmon and small bacteria and because of the absence of harmful microbe," is mentioned on the home page.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, the non-smoker steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, the water bottles without dust and hard-cleaning places will be less microbe.
Home readers are advised to lower the bottles after each use, ideally with a weak washing solution.
Religion must become modern or forgotten
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently appointed Hillary Clinton as its president's candidate.
If the final outcome of the debate will also show the same wish, in January the United States will launch its first president - a woman.
Last week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Teréza Meja discussed the release of Britain from the European regulations with German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Women raised in Western society are raised to know that, thanks to education, ambition and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity.
And today, young girls can be targeted at several existing role models, working in the field of higher leadership.
So has the war really been over for a long and hard time about women's equality?
Hilaria Clinton is ready to become the President of the United States at any time, but the leadership of women in the area of religion is still a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
Women’s leadership in the religious field is still a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the establishment of a new commission with a view to assessing whether women would be introduced as diagonals in the Catholic Church.
The Church of England adopted Libya Lein as the first woman in January 2015, but it was only after an unsuccessful attempt in 2012.
While reforms in the movement of Jewish women have been organized in the rabbinic order since the beginning of 1970 and in the conservative movement since the early 1980s, the idea of the Orthodox Jewish tradition of women still remains very serious.
In November 2015, the Council of the American Orthodox rabbinics, in its third attempt to stop the growing wave of support for the proper order of women, published a very serious message that the concept of women-rabine is contrary to the law.
Not without ironic, when Hillary Clinton was appointed as president's candidate, a group of U.S. leaders, who opposed the women's order, started several "debates" on this issue.
Why is such a difference between time and age?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be long-term traditional values.
This would be an expression of the ability to resist pressure to adapt to the changing society.
Those who oppose women's order do so on the ground that it's not "traditional."
However, the acquisition of traditions in this way is its price.
And the price of such a monopolistic thinking can be paradoxically incorporated into the tradition of itself by withdrawing from the traditional community oxygen that it needs to sustain life.
In the book "August Shooters", in the history of World War I, Barbara Taczmena stresses the danger of giving priority to tradition to what has become known as "the tragedy of sarcano bikis."
Until the beginning of World War I, when war broke out in the near-war distances to the worst artillery, which is expected from the next distance, it became useful to hide the chariots as long as possible.
The British and German troops responded to these changes by replacing their heavy uniforms against their long - standing arrows and bows.
However, French soldiers still wore the same red hats and hats that made them easy targets.
The French Minister of War Adolph Messima's proposal that his troops in his custody might act similarly was perceived with suspicion and opposition.
The armies were represented by the army’s lightning and thunders, and the military traditionalists were not prepared to reject them.
On behalf of France, former Minister of War Eigen Etjéns spoke on behalf of the parliament.
"Reject the fear of the red?" he called out.
Sometimes!
"There was an inexhaustible and idiotic annex to the most visible of all colours," he later wrote to the Messiah, "it was supposed to have bad consequences."
The leaders of the faith who fight for women’s membership in the clergy could be included in the same tracts.
Focusing solely on the "traditional" religion rather than asking the important question, "What changes are necessary for religion to rise?" They risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also attract the entire community of talents, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise give.
It may be traditional to assume that men continue to sow the seeds when they talk about religion, but as it shows the root of the raccoon, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is the founder of JOFA (Sievies Orthodox feminist Association) in the United Kingdom and an Orthodox rabbinic student in Yeshivat Maharath New York.
The newborn baby in the womb gained new skills.
From 1 to 6 August in the centre of Rojupe’s children and young people’s initiative, the so-called "Varavíkskas et al.", during which participants produced, played, and acquired new skills.
On the day of the end of the camp, the children had a great sense of humor as they were surrounded by glass jars.
A youth expert at the centre of the Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative told Mrs. Folkmane that this was one of the activities that the participants enjoyed most.
It was a great pleasure to also make a visit to the "Mazbebriņi" of the Nyera Kalnīna shipyard.
Most of the children liked lasergrave because it was possible to see how the label on the computer was placed at the lower levels.
E. Kalniņš told us what subjects at school should be taught if you want to work in the shipyard, namely mathematics, in particular geometry, computer knowledge, and technical marking and generation.
He also stressed the need to work more on this profession than on the muscles.
There are individual orders on a small street, and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know someone else better, participants took part in various games, as well as jointly formed the "gerbones".
On the third day, the crossing of the sea from Russia to Scotland, natural materials were collected on the way, which were later used for the production of maps.
Sports games that are especially important to participants have also been developed.
We went to a multilived house where we had sports and restrooms, played football and a network bomb.
Children like sports activities, we have many children who play football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sports.
Girls like more peaceful jobs.
The next day, with the help of self-adhesive mass, the decoys that will later be used as marker holders.
There was also a Saturday evening, the children made their own choice, and one evening they were assigned to the front.
The board games were also played, each in his knowledge was able to show the photo during the orientation, where objects were to be found and photographed.
The task was to meet differently in each picture.
We also color almonds - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one job that will please everyone - the next one is sports, the other creative activities.
"Now everyone seems to be working out with glass coating," explained Mr. Folkmane.
At the end of the term, diplomas were issued for creation, sport, and aid - many children were directly involved in economic activities.
The designation "Varavíknes tilts" has been created because of the participation of children from three associations - the centre of Rojupes and Melsila's children and young initiatives, as well as the new Roja's multifunctional centre "Strops".
They are so uniform.
If parents think things out quickly, we'll get the ideas; if the second, they'll get away from us.
We're sharing our experience.
This year, 30 participants - children actively engaged during the year.
"We had planned that there would be 30," says Mr. Folkmane.
It's been five years since the wedding.
It began in 2010, when the social service of Russia renewed its decision that families and missing families need to organize shelters in summer.
However, the situation in Russia has improved over this time, and the housing is now intended for new people who come and work in youth centres.
The goal is to spend time in a contented and comprehensive manner.
Two abortions occurred before, and 20 children were involved in each, and now because of a reduction in the number of children in the country in general, only one abortion is performed.
Similar activities take place during the last year.
In the children’s brand, surrounded by glass, Einar Kalnijš, who learned to burn wood, to build machines from wood, started in different forms.
There's also a new technique - enkaustic, it's coloring with hot wax.
The teacher, Ilzes Šelkova, was involved in the production of polymer materials, made bricks, and various obstacles.
To make candles from natural materials, interesting almonds from apples, birds, lichens, reddish leaves.
We're trying to use what we have around us.
The youth centre works in the winter from 15.00 to 20.00, while in the summer - from 14.00 to 20.00.
"In the center of Sweden, 15 young people visit the centre on average on the day," says Mr. Folkmane.
She points out that much support is given to Russia’s new idea, which understands that it is necessary to give children the means because they are preparing for our future.
Charlton Athletic fan "may be season tickets only if you sign a contract of conduct" and agree not to criticize the club's social media.
While we also recognize that everyone has the right to his personal opinion, the publication of mulsinic comments on such sites is not good.
In the area of administration, he was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from the senior police inspector, Clifa Eger, who joined the club in the last month after 35 years of career police force.
The letter continues: "I need to inform you that the award of the season ticket will be renewed under the condition that you sign "ABC" (ABC), which will provide that you will continue to refrain from the dissuasive or mulsive commentaries published on the club or club representatives of all types of social media pages or any other kind of behaviour that might be considered antisocial."
Speaking to Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after the season ticket fee that was not received, and two days later the letter was received.
At night he went to the front of the club and said, "They told me that I was too "stupid" by letting others laugh too."
Freedom of movement in the course of the course of the Dalmian
What do you think of the word "crazy"?
I drove you out of all the power," said Colina, an former U.S. Navy commander, who just pulled 25 sailboats across some unfathomable part of the central part of the island of Croatia, without leaving anything there, except the Spanish voice of wild and wild seamen thrown out of the fun mountains.
Some bikers play in the sky or the number of children’s activities to make it easier to be in the mountains.
Colina’s friend Petija recommends "The Small Energy That Cool" (The Little Engine).
Other numbers or simply suffer in silence, thinking what it requires to go through a transamble similar to what the rhizomers are talking about.
Colin is more fertilised than varied.
Bringing some gardens to her in front is what it's like in the back of Hyu Grants as a film at the beginning of the "Frequents and One Child".
She and my mission are a long week's "lusus" yacht and ritengbruciens en route to Croatia's North-West Coast and Islands, organized by Freedom Treks.
Rising in summer heat on the mountain floor such as Croatia may not meet every understanding of gravity, but I say that North-West is easier to get out than South-West, our seeds are soft, and when we completed the booking form, free and convincingly before all those months, there was a ship that could not have been able to provide us with a battery loaded with e-vesipated aid.
Part of the deal's luxury is our beautiful home for a week, a whole new Melody.
At the end of Braucena we can gather our bicycles in front of our guides Ivana and Ivana and the ship on the shore to lay their ears in the blue water, without encountering sea ice, rocks and other people on the narrow rock slopes, which are called flats.
In June the water temperature in the sea is perfect, all agree: enough sand to relax, but not gold.
Melody has masks and breathing holes and some things, if someone feels energy after heavy tomorrow on the rocks.
Instead, most of us return to our cabins with air conditioners, where Helen, the ship's mask - I am not able - will be able to cover our beds, add our minibial stocks and leave on the table a new box with chocolates.
Ivan says that it's very important to get out after riding, and on the afternoon we'll learn to blow on our pants or with the brightly-opened clothes on the upper floor with a baby Antonio, who's always ready to prepare one of our cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 beds and a half beds, not a superheated, but a small cruise ship.
It is a struggle against small island ports between fishing vessels and fleet fleets, and we are pleased that we belong to them.
Colina and Petija belong to a group of friends from Washington, Colombia: to sports and public activists after 45, as they themselves call themselves.
Last year’s big and white holidays in the Netherlands were so expensive that they decided to try something even more rich for their experiences, and now they are in Croatia.
The competitive cable from their church is a boat and a bicycle on the free days of Provans, and every afternoon the competitive Facebook publication of pingpong rallij.
The element of holiday experiences can be overemphasized because our graphics is nothing unless a specific regime is established.
"Broxes and the evenings are eight," Ivan announced to the new participants at the opening meeting when we started our journey from the beautiful old Trogir port located near Split.
One ship's call signal shows that the buffet is open, while the other ends of the meal calls for a listening and careful listening to the following information.
"Good!" is a cultural context that may have been lost all but not in the British continent.
Some difference is that the survey has already taken the surroundings that arise from the flood stage, while Ivana has issued a day's trip map, but we all feel that we are afraid of the noise, the explosion of the structures and the profiles of the waves and crises, even though there would be any other surprise in Croatia's orbit, which begins and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Not recommended at all.
Ivan is conducting an information meeting in parallel, free of charge from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to end up with dozens of different people, but we are a simple group - Swiss, Swiss, German, American and British, who are easy to meet on boards in two English languages, but one - German.

We're going ahead, there's always a bridge, but when Ivan gets to stop, there's always a big window, and small holes are like a treasure to those who get in faster.

"Do you think Ivans realize that he doesn't talk to a group of children?" asked the Swiss trainer when we stand on the road and wait for a signal when we can break it.
Not all afternoons we can afford temporary rest.

Lurda's ready to take the saints in the scene of the attack
During the annual celebration of the Catholic Church, people flocked to the church of Lord Lords.
The French security forces are at high risk in preparation, as thousands of Catholics are meeting at the Lord’s Evening Meal on the annual celebration of several terrorist acts in the shadow of the Lord’s Evening Meal.
On August 15, each year tens of thousands of people flocked to the holy mountain of Pirene on the steps of the Festival of Booths to celebrate the celebration of the new Mary in heaven.

After three large attacks, many French citizens are cautious about visiting public activities within 18 months.
The number of tourists declined rapidly, and the authorities felt that this year’s number of pilgrims could be baptized quickly.
However, fear of Massive References was not materialized -- and some organizers say that the application of visitors' applications has been observed lately.

"To Thursday morning at the shrines, armed guards were found, and then through the walls (with metal bars) could only enter one, as well as search for soms," she said The Local.
"This all shocked my three children who have grown up in Lurda, and it was hard for them not to stop when they asked why it happens," she said.
It didn’t ruin my impressions, but I was shocked that it was necessary, and I realized that many people had designated these measures.
The fifth day's opening process has also been interrupted - instead of starting in the city of Lurda and moving further to the shrine, it will begin and end at the shrine.
Other measures include the closure of the airspace for flights over Lurda, the closure of the streets near the traffic hall and the replacement of the waste walls against passing plastic masses.

"The earthquake in this region, as we know, is not unusual, nor is it unusual in the last days of the activity," said the oldest seismologist, Fil Kmans, at the Geoscience Australia Research Centre.

New Caledonia is located in the "Uguns" - in the Pacific Ocean, where deserts and volcanic eruptions often occur.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open control points at the borders of the two countries that were closed following the Venezuelan initiative last year, and on the fourth day, Colombian and Venezuelan President Juan Manuel Santos and Nikolas Maduro were sent.

In August, Maduro was still closing the border by reacting to the attacks by the Colombian army on the Venezuelan border.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were attacked in this attack.
This year, in July, Venezuela opened its border twice because of the economic crisis in the Middle East - the poor Russians tried to cross the border to buy the first goods in trade.

"Facebook" provides war advertising to blockers.
The world's most used social network Facebook has created a warning line to understand that blocking advertising banners using special tools is not acceptable and users will also look at advertising.
The popularity of special advertising blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is directly advertising will be reduced.
Facebook has now made it clear that you well understand the nature of advertising banners, but users will also be able to live with them.
However, they will be provided with tools to be able to choose for themselves which type of material they are shown to be reported to the BBC.
"Since we provide people with more and more control opportunities, we will also start to show ads to those who use advertising blocking software," said Facebook advertising business vice president Andrew Bosvorts.
In other words, users will be able to choose what kind of advertising they see by selecting the brands and sectors that they seem interesting to them.
"People don't like to see ads that don't apply to them or interfere with the contents," Bosvort added.
The advertising blocking tools on mobile devices are usually not working on which Facebook receives a larger visit, but the reduction in banker exposure generated by them in the same currency is measured in billions.
According to BBC information, the advertising blockers are using about 200 million people.
It has already been reported that in the fourth quarter of the previous business year, Facebook revenue from advertising was $6.2 billion or EUR 5.55 billion.
It should be noted that this is not the first time Facebook is active to determine what users of the network see in their new streams.
As one of the last steps, Facebook just started to act to collect or at least limit the new flows with "old" headlines that actually hide "twiss" information.

In Estonia, Zika virus has been detected for nine people.
In each of these studies, nine people have been diagnosed with Zika virus antibodies, which means they could have been infected with this infection, the public radioactivity organisation of Estonia sent ERR.
The information provided by the laboratory shows that this year the Zika virus tests were 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zíka have been found in recent countries in Finland and Sweden.
The health management data of Estonia show that no acute case of HIV infection in the country has been recorded and that in cases of flu-like symptoms, people do not have to undergo a Zika virus test, but they have to contact their family doctor.
We have found IgG (class G immunoglobulin G) antibodies that show that the person in question has been infected with Zika or a similar virus at any time.
"This doesn't mean that the patient is sick with the Zika virus," explained Paul Nabers, head of the Synlab Hospital Hospital.
The green virus is passed through the "Aedes" giant skin.
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of high-quality car purchases, BNS said in the interview to the Car Association Vice-President Ingus Rutinš.
Whether the purchases in the car sector are likely to have problems with dumping prices, Rutish replied positively.
Of course.
The purchases of cars are both different from the purchases of service services that are easier to manipulate at prices.
As a result of the end result of the car, the amount determined must be paid in any case because it must be withdrawn from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Whether the purchaser is not competent and is no longer able to create a quality purchase, as a result, it is often not known, "purchase".
"You are now very well-known buying is built to get something specific, and there is now all the wonder," said the Vice-President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving forward from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous offer as a criterion for determining the purchaser's profit, but in part the public still has a false impression on these matters.
Now it's very popular - let's get the lowest price on the most profitable offer!
However, the criteria must be laid down in both cases, and when they are taken into account and assessed, the decision shall be taken at the same time on the basis of the lowest price principle.
The technical criteria for quality procurement should be very accurate and market-friendly.
However, there is no need to value anything that can be said in the statement of money.
The items do not need to be evaluated for fuel consumption, volume of emissions, service services and similar cases.
It must be known as the expected life cycle of the car, taken, etc., then all can be easily combined.
"The question then is only about which of the scenarios is concerned by the author himself?" explained Rutinš.
On the other hand, the director of the Auto Association Project noted Peter Rubulis that the problems are often related to the fact that only one person and the same person make purchases for both cars and jobs and for food and these purchases are removed from one sample.
We have also brought to the consultation the details of the procurement reserve, which were also difficult to mention as detailed absurdity.
"The problem is that the purchaser is very often lacking any understanding of the subject matter and the requirements are simply collected from something," Rubul admits.
On the other hand, Russia adds - because less is a structure that exposes the procurement, because there may be more problems.
"It is probably because of the lack of human resources and competence," said the Vice-President of the Association.
Latvian volleyballists do not fight for medals.

Turkey is looking for missing diplomats after the trial
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats, which did not return to the returned staff after the trial of 15 July.
Foreign Minister Mevits Čavušogll said on Friday that from workplaces around the world, 208 Turkish Ministerial staff have been recruited to Ankara during the investigation of the attempt, and 32 have gone "without permission".
Some 18,000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their positions in Turkey by the government, considering them to be loyal to the U.S. government official Fatul Gulenu, who is accused of developing the government's recovery plan.
Gulens, who lives in Pennsylvania, is one of Turkey’s most sought-out people.
Kavogle said that the U.S. Department of Justice's team would be visiting Turkey later this month to discuss its possible issue.
This issue has become a problem for the US with Turkey, NATO Member State.
The US opposed Turkey's President Regjepa Tajipa Erdogan's powerful armed tactics after the attack, and Turkey responded by trying to establish closer ties with Russia.
Kavogle said that Turkey's military allies in Greece had fled to Italy, the ambassador in Kuwait tried to escape to Saudi Arabia, but were sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were arrested in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one from Russia went to Japan.
Ankar newspaper Daily Hurryiet, quoting military sources, reported that the loss is also a Turkish military officer in Jordan.
Wall Street Journal, quoting an US officer who is aware of the situation, reported that the Turkish military commander based in Virginia had requested US asylum.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," Kavooglu told the broadcasting organization in the interview.
Since the evenings of those who were originally denied, the time has come to end.
We will take legal action against those who do not return.
Olympical game organizers are trying to clean the bottom of the green bottom of the bottom of the bottom.
The Olympics, for whom the training was scheduled on Friday, went to the closed pool, as the organizers needed more time to clean up the dirty water before the first individual competitions in Rio Olympics.
The water immediately changed color on Tuesday, between the synchronised cooling speed.
The organizers claimed that water sinks were safe even after the more nearby pool of water for the pool and the synchronous pellets were also easily included.
It was still not possible for sportsmen to enter the morning indignity, although the pool was finally opened at 13.00 after local time - just 2 1/2 hours before the women’s 3 meters race.
The water color looked closer to its normal color, yet it remained with a green color.
The American shot by Ebia Johnstone, who jumped on the tramplin, reported that she went to the ground just to find out that the base was closed without any warning.
She wrote in her tweet that "#FixTheSwamp should be fashionable.
British ninja, Thomas Deilijs, who drew the bronze-synchronous platform to the bottom of the platform, also commented on the position of the base.
We hope that this means that we have not been naked during the last days as much as we do in the last days!
Mario Andrada, the main speaker of the Local Organizer Committee, stressed that the base of competition is safe by giving green light to 3 meters ahead.
He admitted that some sportsmen were disturbed by the water, but he said that it was the result of the base cleaning efforts.
"We repeat what we have said all the time - water in no way endangers sports health," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two sportsmen complained that they had no eyes.
This was the result that the first reaction when we saw how the water turned green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in peldbaseins.
We quickly reduced the amount.
We checked the water again, and it fully answers the parameters.
Simon Lengford, the main speaker at the Maria Lenka Water Sports Centre, said that the base was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the world’s leading organisation FINA (International Federation of Defence).
"The idea is that the water needs to be calm so that the base as soon as possible can be back to its green colours," Lengfords said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the basin situation has been overcome by unplanned organizers.
"Chemism is not a precise science," he said.
Some things you can see are long.
In some recent days, the formation of water paints in normal conditions has become even more difficult.
"There's nothing wrong with things," said Andrada.
He added that sportsmen were available summer trains in the morning, but he realized that it was "not ideal."
He explained that basin colour change was increased due to alkaline levels, such as aquarium water could become green if not adequately monitored.
When we started doing something to prevent greens, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We can't use too much chemicals in water, because sportsmen are training it," said Andrada.
We certainly could have done better at the beginning, not letting the water become green.
When it got green, we made a mistake again.

Shanhaja, Taipei, on the fight against cross-border communication, will, however, take the lead
However, the annual urban forum for Shanha and Taipei will be held from 22 to 23 August in Taipei, the municipality of Shanhaja announced on Friday, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
The High-level Government Officer, Mr. Hailins Shanhajas, will take the lead in the task of the delegation represented in the Forum, as announced by the Government of Shanghai in its official microblog account Sina Weibo.
The Forum has been in the process of rotation in both cities since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on exchange of experience in areas such as health care, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, trying to "increase the exchange and cooperation of experience in different aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Government of Shanghai.
The Taiwanese party did not recognise the agreement reached in 1992 with which one Chinese principle was confirmed, since the new leader Tsai Ing-Wen arrived in May as a result of the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Ksiaoguang , the Taiwan office of the National Council spoke on Friday that peaceful cross-border relations could exist while the Taiwan Party joined the 1992 agreement on political foundations.
"We have an active and open attitude to the exchange of experiences between the two sides," MA said stressing that the cross-border relationship and the nature of the exchange of urban experiences should be correctly interpreted.
Uganda's President will be with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, hoping for closer cooperation
The fourth day, in meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Vangu Ji, Uganda's President Joveri Museveni thanked China for its continued support for Uganda's development and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
The museum said that China was a meaningful friend of Uganda and Africa who supported the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and later supported the economic and social development of Africa.
The president mentioned Tanzania - Zambian railway construction in the 20th century as evidence of support in China’s dam, which was provided even when China itself was not particularly fed.
Musevni said that China had implemented multilateral cooperation with Uganda by investing in both infrastructure and business, as well as cultural exchanges, and added that such cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than just providing financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to engage in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and build an industrial park.
He also invites Chinese people to invest more in Uganda and move it.
Vangs It praised Uganda's activities in industrialization and agriculture's modernization and added that China will continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner in Uganda's cooperation.
Vang stated that China is ready to do everything possible to help implement Uganda's economic and social development, adding that China's cooperation is true and without any political considerations, because it is based on high-level political credibility and long-term stability.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda's infrastructure and industrial park, as well as support the development of the energy and agricultural sectors of the people of East Africa.
