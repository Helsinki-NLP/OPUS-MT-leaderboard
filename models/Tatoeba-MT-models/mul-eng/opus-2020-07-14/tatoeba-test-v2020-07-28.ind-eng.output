Let go of Tom!
I spent three hours looking for Tom.
Tom's name is Mary's basketball coach.
Back to America?
Sometimes I go, sometimes I don't.
I have a friend of Tiongkok and want to ask him to teach me Mandarin.
As soon as he saw John selling drugs, he reported it to the authorities.
I had some books in French.
We can find our friends wherever we go.
The scroll was open, and a message was delivered to him.
Who told you I was sick?
Take care of yourself!
It is hidden in the dark.
What's the biggest river in Germany?
I'm using this good opportunity.
It's cold.
The island was warm for years.
Before he comes, I can't go.
Betuti!
He's drinking his water.
I have to visit Tom.
How's the weather today?
How long have you been gone?
Don't believe what Tom said.
You've been thinking about this since the morning.
That's the fruit.
I'm tired of the flu.
These things get free to go in.
Do you use English?
Hello, how are you?
What you need to do is sign your name here.
He hates the party.
There's something I want to tell you.
"Did you ever see Tom carry a handbag?" "Tom, never."
I did it every Sunday morning.
I love it so much.
He left it.
Tom wants a 'sport' car and he's not interested in a family car at all.
It's amazing!
It's nice.
It's stuck in a hot cup of hot water.
My brother salutes you.
At first, I didn't know.
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.
I'm not a student.
It's crazy.
What was used in the United States?
How can the laws of nature be strengthened?
No one understands me.
What do you want to do next?
His name is Tom.
I don't believe your parents let you go here alone.
Unfortunately, you have to go to Japan.
I'll give you some advice.
He seemed sick.
I'm not sure yet.
Do you want something to eat?
What is your hope?
That's probably gonna draw his attention to Tom.
The ticket went into the museum worth thirty dollars.
Do you want something to eat?
I'm working in Tokyo now.
Tom eats alone every day.
Let's keep our marriage.
You're not busy right now?
This room has its AC.
Why didn't you help her?
I got married when I was 19.
Don't Tom really know how to cook?
Where's the supermarket around here?
Tom's hair's broken.
Can I ask you something to drink?
I've done everything I can.
Please put your shoes on.
Tom's always good to me.
Where does he want to go?
He's a DJ.
We don't have to tell Tom that.
Have you had dinner?
I was happy when I read it.
Where do you live at home?
goal I want to learn your language
I want to go drink.
When are you going?
Why can Taro speak English better?
Let's just do it now.
You're spreading lies.
What's wrong?
I'm expecting you last night.
You just made me feel so happy.
Older ones are usually very wise.
I was sleeping when Markus came.
I can't shake my right hand.
I'm hungry.
Or don't answer my questions.
Tom is very different from his father.
Like father, like child.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Tom showed up.
In the end, he became a very good person.
He's from France.
Tom knows he heard something.
It is more precious than corals; nothing you desire can compare to it. ”
I will be happy to help him.
Learning about this foreign culture was fun.
When do you start wearing a lens?
Tom won't like the answer.
Oh, right?
I think you're trying to call us back then.
Without a rope, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnicity and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
It's too thick to be used to cut flesh, I finally use my own knife.
He's blind on his face.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's a coward.
Where are you going?
The trans-literated lamp is used to adjust the direction of the lens.
Don't let Tom see these photos.
This room's got some sunlight.
He's painting a picture.
I shouldn't blow that red light.
Bring me a glass of water.
I'm used to being unintended.
It's a very bad smell.
The news is the news.
There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the Messenger of God.
Just yesterday I knew it.
You can buy it in the bookstore.
Let's get the Intercity-Express.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My dad likes music.
It's very easy to date Tom.
Go home?
No one cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come this morning.
"We're all waiting for two hours." "Yes, this sign will keep me alive."
Tom's one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I'm just telling Tom what Mary told me.
There's talk, there's noise.
You'll never find a way home, through a narrow stone road.
Tom really wasn't at home when we came to visit him.
Mary was a beautiful girl.
That guy's driving the car.
Check the birthday cards that'll be coming soon.
Please read again.
When can you?
I'm just kidding.
Tom's almost drunk.
I went too.
Love never makes a mistake.
That's what I'm looking for.
The funds will be used to cover expenses for professional services.
You don't really want to study logo, do you?
Tom tried to get Mary to help him.
Two things are not involved.
How could I not know this?
What's this called?
I'm still home because the rain is falling.
That is the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
For me, there is no distinction between the cultures of those two countries.
He's gone.
Wake me up at 8:00.
Tell me why he's not here.
That may have influenced their decision.
His dream lasts for the rest of the night.
Tom's starting to dig.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that scary?
I'll buy this bag for you.
It's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Did you ever go to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready yet.
Mary refused to go to the concert.
When are you going home?
She's sitting around her babies.
The boy's been sleeping in his lungs for a while.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left side of the road.
He's focused on those points.
That guy died a few hours ago.
Will you go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We know that the front door is locked.
Can I talk to Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't flow.
Mr. Smith is his acquaintance.
Thank you for your visit.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying by plane.
I thought he was lying, but it didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I couldn't finish reading this book in a week.
The choice of time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We've got a lot of equipment.
Health care is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else to do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any further questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
All of us are under law - abiding citizens, but we may at times find it hard to be generous with our time.
He must have made it.
I like cats.
It's over at nine.
Tom's mentally disturbed.
Maybe I'm crazy?
We had a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, right?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone has made mistakes.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mother hasn't been here for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with his car, just you can't drive.
Can I see your coat?
He seems to be serious about reading.
Tom married a woman who was easier than himself.
He's a hand from his father.
He has good words to shame himself.
I may be tired, but I am excited.
He tried to kill himself but eventually he failed.
Do you guys have beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I re-carnation, I want to be born again as a bitch.
We've got a lot of rain this summer.
He made important scientific discoveries.
He's a student.
Tom's here, but Bill hasn't come yet.
Laurie's slowing down.
They encouraged him to go alone.
Tom is a good man.
I'll call you back in 20 minutes.
They're asleep.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom's been cheating on Mary.
Not fewer than 40 percent of students go to university.
Tom put the pen on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom was so loud that no one could hear him.
Did you see anything?
What are you looking at?
Did he take long?
She told him every morning when she went to school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very expensive, better than on the left.
We don't really see that accident.
His mother was worried about his son.
What opera is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I feel tired.
Tom was killed by Mary.
His data is often incorrect.
Wake up!
We've already ordered the six-thirds.
We called the dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom signed up for Mary to follow her.
It's late.
I'm smarter than them.
The sky is getting dark.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
It's just gone.
They're crazy!
