I'll get some ice.
It's not good to look at people.
What's my balance?
Who wins?
At the time, he lived alone in the house.
Did you call?
I don't think I have that one.
I saw an old friend.
I chose another way.
Tom left ten minutes ago.
Socker's going to be a monster.
He's been living on that hotel for the last five days.
I wanted the best.
I have a good look.
Tom's making food.
I ran to my mom.
I'm new.
Tom's drunk.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
Are Tom and Mary going to school today?
Hurry up, Tom.
Life in prison is worse than life of an animal.
I thought you thought about me.
He's not coming.
I wouldn't have done that.
Why do I have to go?
Can I help you?
How can we stop them?
How rich is Tom?
She's got a picture.
Is that what you want?
Be nice to Tom.
Don't look so shocked.
She's gone.
Don't you know Tom again?
They're suffering from malaria.
I was with someone.
Tom seems to be asleep.
Viking sharks with horns are no longer on the ground in Scandinavia.
Fifteen percent of British women prefer chocolate before sex.
Tom said why?
I have to stay down.
How long is that bridge?
When did you get in?
I got up early last night.
You thought the earth was flat.
He never made a promise.
It smells salt and algae.
I got shampoo in my eyes, and it's funny.
She tried.
He's moving up early.
Wash your hands.
This shit is amazing!
Did I say too much?
Can I ask who?
Did anyone hurt?
Mary was infected by Japan.
I'm sure it would be a mistake to tell Tom.
Who told Tom that I wasn't feeling well?
I knew I just had to get out of the ship.
I'm fine, thank you.
It's nice to dance.
Maybe I'm not coming back.
How can this help?
Who discovered America?
Why don't you just let Tom help?
Don't waste your time.
Do you remember this game?
I need ice.
The beach was full of tourists.
There is no way to predict what will happen next year.
I hate surprises.
I've only seen it once.
On TV, what is your favorite program today?
I need your number.
I enjoy classical music.
Who killed her?
Are you studying chemistry?
Let go of me!
Here's an example.
I know where he lives, but it's a secret.
What was Tom's death like?
I slept deep.
In Latin there are five declinations.
What did you call me?
I have to get Tom.
It's amazing.
Tom's dad, who's in prison, never writes to him.
Tom gave me a few bucks.
They played in the dress show.
They took their jackets off.
I can't see anything with my right eye.
I heard the message.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Do you remember them?
Just give it to Tom.
What part of Canada do you come from?
I'm a human.
Sometimes she's taking the bus, sometimes she's driving.
It's almost as big as this.
Is it too hard?
I knew your father.
You're nice in your hair.
This giraffe has a skin disease.
I could help Tom.
The sun shines from a blue sky.
It's irrelevant.
Someone's eaten my ass.
I'm learning the language myself.
I've had a long day.
All my things are here.
This is very cheap.
I wrote to him for another reason.
Everything was very good.
Melanie knows the truth.
What's all that?
I don't think you're the least.
The TV's on.
I won't remember how old I was when I first met Tom.
Don't throw it in your armpit.
Be friendly, but determined.
Interlingua is a modern tool for international communication.
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Everything in this world is just a dream.

We should set up a trap.
Can you help me drive?
How did the miner look?
There were many people in the room.
My big brother is a teacher.
Tom won't let Mary do it.
I fell in love with a woman.
Can I watch TV now?
She's crying.
Tom shut down the radio.
Where's your car, Tom?
She's crying for surprise.
You're dangerous.
I owe him 100 yen.
I know money isn't everything.
You look like a little girl in that dress.
I'm good at driving.
Is she right?
Have you talked to anyone about these things?
Don't worry!
I like your scarf.
What is she talking about?
She should've done it already.
Tell me what to think.
The sea looks like a sea.
Alice log.
Tom looks fantastic.
I have to say something.
We have to do it.
The bird was placed in the tree and hung on the rock.
We need help.
It's a long way from the summer.
Because of the bad cut, the weather price has gone up in the last six months.
I know Tom's not happy there.
She's been studying English since the age of ten.
She died in 1960.
He knows how to fly a helicopter.
Time's in.
I can respect that.
Tom would have been different.
He's having too much fun.
She had hair on her feet.
Japan is a beautiful country.
Is anyone following you?
How are you gonna fly?
That's true.
Layla doesn't trust men.
We're both adults.
Tom didn't find what I was hiding.
Tom and Mary are getting married.
Why did you buy that?
I'm drinking coffee.
Are you kidding me?
It's starting to be time to go home.
Is there anyone who can answer?
You don't have to say anything if you haven't lost.
It's blouseing today.
Tom and I were both happy.
I worked while the baby was sleeping.
Can you explain these rules?
I'll pick up Tom.
There was a wild crowd there at that time.
You have to go now.
I can do that, too.
I think it's a positive development.
I don't want to see him now.
His new film is famous.
What did Tom give you in your birthday present?
Good job, bitch.
The lion is the king of the devil.
I love this company.
A good wine doesn't need to be advertised.
Tom's numbers were pretty persistent.
Tom was forced to improvise.
Tom sees Mary as a hero.
I don't want any wine.
Four days after the concert, it was still in his ear.
I'm learning Hungarian.
I'm born in Israel.
Have you eaten breakfast?
How often does that happen?
Of course, I understand.
I took Tom to the hospital.
Can't you stay a minute?
I'd like to believe you.
No one heard.
You're just nervous.
This car looks happy.
His clothes are too small.
Are you watching?
Tom took a knife out of a hole in the kitchen.
We played chess and it was nice.
You're very energetic.
Let's dress the Christmas tree.
She'd like to come, but she was on vacation.
You've made a mistake on my name.
This isn't about you.
Who's that woman in a brown jacket?
Hey, where are we?
I think we should go.
Just sit down, Tom.
I don't like watching TV.
I'll give it to you.
What have we got here?
How can I stop Tom?
Is anyone there?
It wouldn't play any role, though.
I don't know if he's a doctor.
He went into the bank dressed as a guard.
I can't do it now.
One day you'll forget about me.
We've seen what Tom can do.
Did you go crazy?
Just sit down, Tom.
They're stealing them.
That wasn't the agreement.
Can I get your attention?
We have to defend our country at every price.
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Tom is mentally ill.
This beer has high alcohol content.
I've got a lot of money.
You can't do it anymore.
She's in prison.
Wenjin is a Chinese woman.
She had pain in the whole body.
Do you know her?
I have to work today.
Tom's head was French.
As he spoke, the sound of a shot was heard.
Do you have any coins in your wallet?
Be in love!
It could be fun.
Believe what you want.
We need to work now.
How can we get to work?
Don't expose it.
I have nothing to do with that video.
Hurry up and eat up.
I've never seen so many brave men in one place.
I wouldn't lie to you.
This is my ship.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
Has Tom noticed anything yet?
The storm has caused terrible damage.
Where can I buy the apple?
Is this really your car?
I know the girl who plays tennis.
Tom just wants a muffin and a cup of coffee.
I already did.
Is your wife in America?
I opened the ass.
I don't know why Tom had to do that.
Alice's got a great bone.
I could've drunk.
Fengs put eggs in the egg.
Mary's interested in politics.
I'm from Turkey.
It's an amazing result.
I'd like to play tennis.
It took a night and an hour.
What's all this?
Can you lock the door, please?
This room has 2,000 people.
Read this first.
We need you.
I've got everything under control.
We'll be together.
Tom doesn't breathe.
I'm always going.
They grow up like rabbits.
I must have eaten something weird.
I can feel it.
I don't like this place.
I'm sorry I didn't go to you.
We can't help you.
The gold price flows daily.
That was his decision.
Forget her.
She's worried about her weight.
She likes the green dress.
She said she had an apology.
You support the plan, don't you?
The last day of the application is in the morning.
I don't think I have this.
Morfar's talking very slowly.
I just love these things.
He's not crazy.
Let it go!
I'd like to go with Tom.
Many trees lose their leaves in the winter.
There's no doubt one of the worst ideas I've ever heard.
All good things are three.
I'm excited about the lesson.
I'm going to Paris on Sunday.
Can I order you now?
We love you so much.
It's happening automatically.
Tom has asked me to marry him.
The Netherlands is closely related to Germany.
And why not?
Tom forgot to set the weekend.
How do you say it in Italian?
He's very worried about his son's future.
I like you, too.
This is his car, I think.
They're not always there.
When you talk about the troll!
I've got lots of broken books for sale, all for excellent prices.
The course is divided into four smaller parts.
I've had fun.
You can't be late this time.
That's enough for today.
There was no one in the room.
Everything's quiet again.
The garage's so stupid.
Tom's got bad hygiene.
Tom's eating.
My brother's an innocent car driver.
His magic's coming.
Excuse me.
Every part of the island has been wiped out.
Long live kings!
Tom hated it.
I don't know how to buy a ticket.
Don't give me that look.
I work night.
Did you design this?
Markka seemed pretty surprised.
I haven't had coffee yet.
We'll go with you.
No point on Tatoeba contains the word "antema".
Tom wants help.
Tom doesn't want to be a doctor, even though he's a lot of natural science.
I don't know Tom anymore.
I don't remember anything.
It works in the head.
Are you sure this is Tom's office?
Tom is my husband.
Emily's gonna tell Melanie.
He bought me a bottle of tomatoes.
Would you mind giving me some medicine?
Have a good day.
He's got evidence that he's an employee.
She was brave.
We've got to end this.
How do you think I know?
He's been sentenced to murder.
Would you like to see your room?
I want you all right.
How do parents do that?
Listen to me!
It's mine.
I'd like to meet you again next week.
Have you ever been touched?
He loves trains.
I put it back.
You're gonna know something.
I killed the mouse.
I'll play football after school.
Tom doesn't understand what you're saying.
Where's Algeria?
Emily hates to dress.
Tom doesn't like Boston.
We carried out our investigation with the highest accuracy.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Never write "bossyt" and "sytji" in German!
"She's dead." "No, it's not possible!"
He did it for himself, not for me.
Welcome to hell!
He committed many sins in his youth.
This egg is fresh.
I ran away from Emily.
How bad was that?
Parents love their children.
You said it was too easy.
Tom asked me who was responsible for the accident.
What brand do you like?
Who are all these people?
I didn't ask questions.
It's empty.
Tom looked at Mary.
The bird is in the sky.
Can you believe this is actually happening?
What's on the agenda?
You've lost your concentration capacity.
Are you waiting for us at the station?
I'm glad you'll remember.
Your house is big.
What a creative idea!
It's a present to you.
Tom almost got hit by a car.
Who's the leader of all the gangs this year?
Are you sure he doesn't have a girlfriend?
I did it for the first time.
Tom was wrong at school.
What's the matter today?
Tom's happy.
Does it make sense?
You missed my name.
I wish I had more friends.
I think it's a bluff.
He's got a lot of new men.
You're making a mistake.
Does the milk from this clean really taste good?
I want you to go to the meeting tomorrow.
I need a cab!
I'm buying furniture from Ikea.
Wikipedia is the best encyclopedin on the network.
No one knew where he was going.

You're going to Ireland.
Can I see you later?
You're so beautiful.
Are Tom and Mary going to school today?
Tom Major Mary.
Yeah, a little big.

We're flexible.
Can I see you there?
I'm trying to figure out why someone would get to do something like that.
I don't think politics is always true.
I needed this.
Tom knew her.
Tom showed up the contents of his wallet.
The man died of lung cancer a week ago.
Tom's brave.
Tom could barely go.
The United States is a republic while the United Kingdom is not.
You should have told me you can't smile.
To be sweet also has nuisances.
I'm gonna miss that uniform.
I thought Tom would say hi to Mary.
We have a cat, we love all cats.
I'm old.
We have to go now.
Africa is the guard of humanity.

The brother's as hard as the stone.
I'm very interested in football.
Tom's cooled off.
Where's the hat?
We'll win.
Tom ran after Mary.
Why do I need help?
Can I get one?
Why didn't you tell the police about this?
We'll just let it go.
It would have been fun.
Don't worry, it's simple.
I dressed up in a tree.
Take it!
I spoke to the police.
We don't have much money, but we have enough to buy what we really need.
I thought you were used to living in a van.
I hate all kinds of insects.
What's your favorite champ?
Are you sure it's safe?
Is she speaking French?
Don't get up.
I've already learned what I wanted to do.
What did they take?
It's Mary's turn to drive.
He loved himself in the beautiful princess.
I have other plans.
Promise me not to laugh.
I think it's the job.
Don't let go of it.
It was his silence that made her angry.
Tom's got a back-up.
The baby came up against me.
You know Tom?
I'm the law.
It wasn't the plan.
Please come with us.
Can you watch the kids?
I don't think Tom understood that shit.
When I found the room, it was empty.
Can the use of violence be justified?
His absence yesterday was due to an apology.
She's like my own child.
Tom's very, very good.
How old is this?
It's used to divide Swedish substances into five declinations.
I'm driving a Porsche.
I'd like to talk to you again.
The train in the park has already begun to get color.
Do Tom know about that?
The doctor finds it carefully before he decides what medicine he should give.
I never went and let me go.
The current password is "eosdigital".
Where's the wheelchair up?
Tom picked up the phone.
My dog ran away.

I told them to send me another ticket.
He's always kind to animals.
Who do we work for?
It's time to go to the gym.
Wait a minute.
I can't do this without you.
Are there many warehouses in this town?
Do you have shoes and shoes?
She likes Russian pop.
Let me take care of Tom, okay?
He's always pressed on money.
Love and hospitality can't be lost.
I'll be nice to Tom.
Were they with you?
How hot is it?
Hey, listen to me.
He's my brother, not my father.
He must buy a new bike to his son.
Tom went back.
What did you do with the dog?
Sami was in heaven.
I'm the best.
I have a boat and a car.
I've always wanted a dog.
They broke up.
Why did we say that?
The answers are correct.
My English teacher recommended that I read these books.
You think Tom was full?
Tom spent three years in prison.
Could you explain the way to Madame Tussaud?
How long have they been here?
When you talk about the troll.
For her, it's an offense.
What's the bathroom doing in the kitchen?
I can't stand this sound anymore.
You should follow school rules.
I can't see her.
Let me be.
Tom's been hurt.
How sure is Brazil?
Did you see that, Jamal?
Let go of a little fresh air.
I'm on my way to Boston now.
Which book is it?
My mom's here.
I came from China.
I'm up to everybody.
Is this the word t:?
I like dogs and my sister like cats.
Where do you live right now?
Same set and bath.
Everything was well prepared in advance.
He didn't like to be punished.
Would you like to see a magic trick?
They're short and short.
What's new?
I have another option.
Nature is full of mystery.
I heard a sound.
You don't need to understand everything right now.
Don't forget what I said to you again.
I'll be outside the city.
Give me three minutes.
It's pretty cold.
No one cares what you think.
They went crazy.
Shouldn't you use your hands?
It's a gift.
I could never keep a secret.
Tom could be a cop.
I can't eat.
In many parts of the world, it is illegal to shoot wild animals such as dogs, snakes, or fascists.
I've decided to go to retirement.
I'm from Norway.
She's crying.
I'm proud of all of you.
I think Tom's right.
He fled from the theater after the murder.
I'm back today.
A taxi is standing and waiting.
The cat sleeps on the table.
Your French is great.
I'm a plaintiff.
He must love you.
Yes, in the most limited sense of the word.
Give me that now.
Can you prove it?
They're actors.
What does that mean?
I'm looking for work.
Have you forgotten?
Did you have fun on the tour?
Tom and Mary are getting married.
Did you put this on your hand?
It's right for him.
Tom's been bluffing.
I got a loan yesterday.
I used to go to school when I was a child.
Sign up on this line.
When you ask, "Why" is the last answer you want to "Why".
The charges will soon go up.
That's okay.
He translated Homeros from Greek into English.
She thought about it.
The toilet is temporary out of function.
I had a sense of it.
I don't think I'm going to college.

She thought about it.
I need more money.
I was wrong.
I've got a lot of things to do.
I don't want to be an adult.
We're here to help.
We're going all the way to the station.
Tom's been printing a whole piece.
The fuel level is empty.
She let me go.
Sami moved into Layla's apartment.
I'll take it.

Can you show me a more cheap camera than this one?
Did they talk to Marika Swedish?
Tom's waiting for you.
There's nothing on earth that doesn't affect the sun.
Why do you want it?
I have one question.
Was Fadil really surprised or did he just make mistakes?
He sat on a little rock and looked over the sea.
I miss my wife.
I don't remember how old I was when I first met Tom.
We've never done that before.
My bags are packed.
You did a great job.
It's all right!
I don't want to make a mistake.
The company I worked for was about to cut down, and unfortunately I lost my job.
They're on the track!
Be on your watch.
I still don't feel sure.
It wasn't sensitive.
I know your mom.
You should clean the hole.
Tom dog alone.
Is Tom and Mary going to school today?
No, no, no, no.
We were banks.
We're closing at 19.
He should follow my advice.
You think you're telling Tom what I've done?
Our ship wasn't damaged in the war.
I can survive you.
I stole it from Tom.
Hang up your hat, thank you.
We played baseball.
A dog jumps.
She likes things.
Let Tom live.
Thank you very much for your support!
Is it toxic?
You did the right thing that told us.
We've finished talking.
You have a better condition than I do.
Tom's wrong, you know.
I remember Tom.
Tom isn't big enough.
We'll meet you there.
As soon as the girl saw her mother, she began to cry.
It's pointless.
We have time on our side.
She's talking about risk.
It's not enough once.
The tower will rise.
See.
I have a lot of friends.
I'm your new partner.
The elevants listen to a story reading.
How can we prove it?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is that what you're thinking?
She doesn't eat meat, does she?
This is clean.
Hey, you're Tom Va?
I'm fixing trace radio devices.
We asked him what he was doing.
You can fix all this.
I've always wanted to do that.

Tom won't come in time.
My friend is seventy years old.
The number of Europeans visiting Thailand every year is very large.

That's true.
Are you a prisoner?
Even though communication and excommunication seem equal, they have nothing to do with each other.
Do it one more time.
The enemy threw us into a trap.
I've got enough!
I'll start eating less meat.
Help me lift the package.
Don't forget to breathe.

I won't wait forever.
How was "pretty"?
A cup of tea, thank you.
Today is the hottest day of the year.
Tom asked Mary to help him.
They're in hold.
Any bed is better than no bed at all.
How can you be so stupid?
The devil is in the details.

Where's the nearest toilet?
I have a dog that can jump fast.
The planet made a perfect landing.
Can we rent one of these boats?
I don't think she'd understand.
I don't like this music.
Glude lamps consume electricity.
Hessa sludge!
What would you like to eat?

This is the right thing to do.
I told Tom.
Bess is just a child.
Are you Finns or Russians?
Are you busy?

I hope we can help.
As a tour, no blood was shed.
Keep talking.
Tom knows he's right.
That's the best we have.
Nothing can go wrong.
Stop worrying.
What can Tom do?
Tom's deep.
I really like this restaurant.
They're all the same.
It's best you don't wait anymore.
Tom said he wanted to get out of town for a while.
I need to make a clear reading before dinner.
You have to be patient.

That's enough.
My view is irrelevant.
I don't need any help.
The Netherlands is a small country.
Can I do it for you?
I slept like a stock.
What makes you think Tom likes heavy metal?
Can you do that for me?
He described the fugitive in detail.
Who's talking about Tom?
He appreciates that the new house will cost about thirty million yen.
Mary's attractive.
I suggested that she be invited to the party.
The door is open now.
Tom has a gym.
Are you kidding me?
I don't waste anything.
She spent most of the day at the hospital.
Where are we now?
You're going to speak Swedish.
I'm in the car.
Tom took off his shirt.
I'm just going to write a word in German.
Wait, Tom, tell me the breakfast's over.
One of us could win.
He's going up at 7:00.
I'm sorry I've caused you so much trouble.
What are you counting on?
We ask the teacher questions every day.
You have nothing to be proud of.
I don't know what I want.

I love that story.
Tom hated spinach.
I speak Japanese, English and French.
I wasn't aware you were so bad.
I've been quite busy.

I never looked at them.
I like that dress.
I hate to be late.
No, you can't use my car!
I know you're busy.
I'll be alone.
What's that worth?
I'm glad to do that.
I'm sorry, it's true.
We'll be ready for the party.
What did you look at?

Come on!
It wasn't great.

Have all found their mistakes?
Where's your brother?

I let my feelings cloud my judgment.
Tom took Mary's hand.
People sit on the grass.
I heard a South American camp was set up by an anaconda.
She felt we were too different.
They look so happy.
The lake had frozen, so we went over the lake.
Why does Tom never say hello to us anymore?
Actually, it's a good point.
Who said I stole the money?
They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
Don't you mind?
This paper doesn't absorb ink.
It hurts in the neck when I pray for it.

It's okay.
I'm responsible for his behavior.
Tom's scared.
I got a piece of paper in my Christmas cup.
She's playing hockey on the saints.
You don't talk much.
The red paraplete reminded her of her mother.
I remember the first time.
This is a very timed task.
Tom took his clothes off and went into the shower.
The other kids call her Nasse.
That meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom's teaching.
She's got too much work to do.
She's right.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Do you know Tom how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It's not sure if the letter ever came forward or not.
We haven't done anything.
You killed your pen.
You think you're in bed all day, right?
So Tom can't do it.
Tom's screaming under the roof of the day.
I didn't even know what she was doing.
Do you really want to do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.
She's great.
Can I meet Tom today?
No one wants to.

Try it now.
It really didn't affect us.
Are you crazy, Tom?
I'm going like a penguin.
Did I forget something?
You're more than me.
Thank you for your birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like going to new places and seeing new things.
I'm gonna have to put it on.
Aren't we friends?
Her numbers scared me out.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we're going to do what Tom proposes if no one else has a better proposal.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only talk to myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You should've thought about it.
I got some more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate's sorry.
I know you're missing your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems to be excited.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt about who is chosen.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read Sagan about the ring triangle?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not a simple language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She suggested equality.
What are you looking at?
They're still young.
Stop talking to me.
Hello, my dear brothers.
Where's the Portuguese ambassador?
My friends didn't weaken me during the trial.
Tom shot me in the leg.
I was just saved.
Keep it down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.

I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the trunk.
I hope you find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Come back in the truck.
She helped the old man across the street.
No one's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of that was true.
There must be a pattern.
It's a shame to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom laughed at me.
Tom's helping.
One morning he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the soup.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's out.
My dad's cool.
We can save many lives.
You don't have any money, so you'll be fine without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words immediately filled me with new strength.
Put the card on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a couple of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I've been here since.
Even my mom knows about it.
He should've done it already.
Room service, thank you.
Who were you talking to?
The boy took it to the cat's couch.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of stuff.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your apology.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He's gonna fall for the deadline.
Neither does it work.
I can explain.
She's acting like a child.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I can do all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After stopping the accelerated train quickly.
What does that involve?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to join, but can you at least accept that there are people who have views other than you?
Tom was taking the book down.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't think of meeting him again.
Even in working hours, I pay for my Internet dependence.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You haven't been away for a long time.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't take me down to town.

I just wish I could be as happy as you seem.
Tom started to have a better start.
I could sell this.
Are you waiting for us at the station?
I've got so much work to do, I'll stay an hour.
He's welcome.
He wrote down the phone number.
Tom's gonna be back today on the afternoon.
We had a long period of good weather.
They were members of the middle class.
Tom's pregnant.
None of the involved had any visible damage.
I'm just getting a whole lot of news.
Tom wants something else.
I'm gonna buy a beer for Tom.
We're in Paris.
What have you told them?
I guess it can't help.
The door is open now.
Tom died.
Car's trained.
They're a virgin.
What yoga station is your favorite?
Tom took his hat and his pen.
Tell them the truth.
I love that tattoo.
You're Tom's favorite.
We took each other in hand for it.
I get it.
Poor is not the one who has a little but the one who needs a lot.
It would have been fun.
Tom disappears soon into the mass.
My father loves my mother.
I'm gonna get scared.
How old were you when you stopped believing in the void?
He built a new house.
We're going to do a little bit of it.
We're gonna have children.
I don't know anyone here.
I was home.
I hope Tom and Mary don't wake up.
He speaks Portuguese.
I'm afraid of the bus.
Tom's positive, isn't he?
Where's Mississippi?
Let's put the little thing on the beach.
Who are you meeting?
I'll never go out.
The red paraplet reminded her of her mother.
Tom showed us how.
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.
The more we have this, the more we want.
Take a good time with you.
Your money or your life!
She didn't try to translate the letter.
She died.
Tom fell out of sleep.
Do I talk too fast?
Did you see my cat?
How can I help Tom?
The real man drinks tea.
Mary likes to party.
We bought a newspaper.
Here's your shirt.
I told Tom he wouldn't come today.
I've got Russian compasses.
You don't have to do it right now.
Soccé! This is the 5000-klingon meaning of Tatoeba!
I heard a sound.
How can you watch such macabre movies without getting nightmares?
I don't like it when you take the job home.
She doesn't like snakes or mathematics.
I'll write about it.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Young people like popular music.
Are you sure?
Tom's disgusting.
She killed the handcuff.
Tom's mother and Mary's father were killed together in World War II.
Be respectful.
Does it hurt a lot?
Tom's still alive.
Have you been down on your own?
My name is Farshad.
Well, that's right.
The police have arrested a suspect.
It's cool.
She can't stop me.
She was talking about the coffee with an accident.
I felt very bad about the opposition.
Have you enjoyed it?
Go on with your work.
I can't do this without you.
How did we do that?
You're the best dad ever.
Tom is a deserter.
The power is sitting too hard around my neck.
It's a bus here.
The fast-paced birds were still global.
I'm too young.
I can't just go.
How did Tom find out?
I thought you were gone.
I was removed from space.
The loss of her father was very painful for her.
I was in a bad mood.
I won!
I saw an opportunity.
I knew it wasn't you.
When the kids see him, they're all running away.
I'm gonna have to ask for it now.
I dreamed I was flying.
It's time to get up.
Is it hot out there?
We're closing at 7:00 p.m.
I play in the garden.
She was working a matte.
Our teachers come to school with a car.
That's weird.
I felt very relieved when I heard the news.
Can I use your phone?
Don't let people make you crazy about money, hair and clothes.
This is my bags.
Is Tom a member?
This is a real salomanic solution.
The cat on the table sleeps.
Medus knocks on the door.
This is the best ship I've ever been on.
I'm good at my job.
How's it going to be that you won't buy a blue?
I don't know yet.
It's a bad habit.
I asked Tom to stop.
The worst thing with the summer is this.
Where can you buy bus tickets?
Are you studying or working?
Can't I stay here with you?
I can survive alone.
We're in a recession.
I have a question.
Tom was successful.
I'll give you my word.
It's not just a pen.
I couldn't stop Tom.
I don't think I'm going to lose you forever.
Who's that guy?
The language students participated in a language course program.
I found them all new.
I'm making you nervous, aren't I?
I admire you.
I saw Tom tonight.
They're pretty on the rice.
In Rotterdam another crew took over the ship.
I think I'm finally going to retire.
"My watch has been stolen." My father cried out.
Did you explain it?
The Greek was mine.
Tom's there.
This didn't work.
All this is because of you.
He's the head of law.
Tom looks guilty.
I heard Tom had drug addicts in America for years before he went to jail.
Maybe you're right.
Go get a beer.
I saw Tom less than an hour ago.
I need a knife.
I have to say this.
I got two tickets.
He took his time.
Anything's going to be okay.
Stick!
I'm not good for you.
We asked Tom about it.
His explanation wasn't enough.
We were proud of Tom.
I don't think Tom did anything about it.
I've got a headache.
That's exactly what I need.
I was told where she was.
Explain it to me.
You must be very busy.
Where's my stuff?
It was loud.
How was the recovery?
Her hair is dry.
Don't be so negative.
We'll start the meeting when Bob comes.
Did you have fun at the game?
You have to go home.
It works.
All right, everybody, listen up.
When can we see it again?
What could this be?
The official dinner was held in the Vita house.
How many girls do Fadil have?
You don't know me about my head.
Leave the door open when you go!
This is a small step for a human but a trap for humanity.
Can I call your cops?
I don't get paid to do it.
You got paid, didn't you?
He's always willing to help others.
You can't hurt Tom.
The garage was empty.
I'm beautiful.
It sounds familiar.
It was a great weather.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
It's hard to talk publicly.
You're always helping Tom get his room?
For a moment, I thought he was crazy.
Is it really so sick to eat eggs?
Target!
I needed that job.
The TV was all the time.
Give me a day.
Get some food.
Tom wants one.
Get your right arm up.
I'm going to church.
He's absolute.
I gave the tiger all the money I had.
It was just the beginning.
But I don't have any money.

The bottled wine.
How am I supposed to thank you?
Have you missed us?
We got it analyzed.
He's always happy.
He came to Berlin as a teacher.
That's my dog.
I'm just a little French.
You'll never say.
I'm a student.
I never doubted that.
Tom's young.
I live in Qatar.
I've heard that Tom hates you.
I hope you enjoy your visit here.
We'll do it again.
Are you hungry yet?
Dogs can smile.
He likes much about music.
I was told.
We need to buy wine.
No winter will always be.
Tom's focused on the game.
I'll do it if you support me.
Why don't Tom get out of the way?
I'm working on this number.
I'll take care of my mother.
My father, my father, my father's father, and my father's father had all the same names as me.
Don't sit on that bank. You're welcome.
We'll get a new one.
I don't think I could do what Tom does.
Can this help?
He's always playing good.
Tom was patient in his chair, waiting for Mary.
I don't understand.
Tom didn't tell the truth.
It's a problem.
I'd like to help.

We don't know where we are.
He likes to travel.
I speak Japanese well.

Don't worry about it.
At the time, there were few who could travel abroad.
Be generous.

How do I explain it?
There's no problem.
He kept the water on his own.
The room is full of people.
Tom's here.
This is wrong.

You, I have an idea.

I know that it may not be as fun to add opinions to your mother tongue or stronger language as to practice in foreign languages, but be friendly and do not add opinions in the Tatoebas corpus if you are not absolutely sure that they are correct.
