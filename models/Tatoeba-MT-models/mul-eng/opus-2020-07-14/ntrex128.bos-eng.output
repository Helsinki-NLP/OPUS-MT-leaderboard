The great members of the congregation are concerned about the similarities with the Mappeovs.
Some members of the congregation were upset by the proposal to change their title to the "Members of the Parliament" (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly in the Great Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the entire political spectrum are concerned that they might become subject to ridicule.
One member of the lab said his group was worried "because it's rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers out of Vels: On a large twp means blev, and pwp means a product.
A party member from the political party Plaid said that the group was "not satisfied" and submitted alternative names.
A member of the large conservative party said his group was "open" on the subject of change of names, but he mentioned that there was a small difference between the MWP and Mappevac concepts.
In this context, the expression of a great word is similar to the expression of a word in Irish English.
The Community Commission currently working on the draft law on the introduction of the name change said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the title of the members of the congregation will, of course, bring the members to its own."
The law of the government of Vels in 2017 gave the assembly permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public debate on proposals resulting in great support for the appointment of the Assembly by the Grand Parliament.
When speaking about the title of the members of the congregation, the Commission gave priority to the name of the members of the Parliament or of the WMP, but the option of the MWP received the most support in the public debate.
The members of the congregation are alleged to make alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could be made to the head of President Elina Jones, who is expected to submit a draft change law for several weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes to the way the Community works, including rules on the disqualification of the members of the Community and the Commission system plan.
Members of the congregation will have the last opportunity to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians go to the referendum on the change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The national vote is organized in an effort to resolve a multi-denominational dispute with a neighbouring Greece that has a territory called Macedonia.
Atina has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour represents its territory and is strongly opposed to its demands for membership in the EU and NATO Agreement.
Macedonian President Dr. Ivanov, an anti-pelebian opposition to the change of name, said he would not accept the vote.
However, the referendums, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, consider that the change in names is simply the price they have to pay for membership in the EU and NATO pact.
The bells on St. Martin were silent while the church in Harlem fought for the stand.
"The older people I've talked to say they were barbaric and churches at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one today."
He said the missing bar is understandable.
"People are different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer a quarter of a day's living room where people go regularly."
As for the church, it worries him that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the manuals expect, "and sooner or later, they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by state buildings with dwellings full of people who will not help in the preservation of the rest of the Quartet churches.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why it's going to speed up closing these churches because it's unlikely that people who will move into these buildings will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis — the Metropolitan Community of 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The first white-medium community was settled in the 1930s.
The black community she served near took over property over the building.
The Church of St. Martin took over the Black Community under the leadership of the late General John Howard Johnson, who led the fighter on the 125th street, the main trading street in Harlem, which was opposed to the recruitment or promotion of the blacks.
The fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but as Johnson's father's hunters rebuilt the plan, they ordered the organs.
The great David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "the voice of the poor."
The associate who played the organ in July called them different: "cultural goods" and "exchangeable historical instrument."
Colonel Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organs in the world to play black musicians, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger organs in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said the St. Martin Church didn't find a replacement for him.
What was played in the Church of St. Martin in the last few months is a complex story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of which were brought by church leaders, and other Episcopal Bishops.
The Bishop’s Office – the bishop’s board of bishops, composed of church heads – wrote the bishop’s letter in July to express his concern that the bishop would "supply to transfer costs" to the bishop’s office, although the bishop’s administration was not included in the rent of the architects and the businessman who sent the bishop.
Some Jews complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's work.
Aikula was injured by a 13-year-old in hunting in California.
Aikula was attacked and wounded by a three-year-old boy while he was hunting for a horseman in California on the day of opening money to a horseman, officials reported.
An attack occurred about seven hours in the morning near the beach Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday he broke up with his friends about half an hour when he heard the boy who came to help and then took him out with the group and helped get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was an excitement because of the noise, but then he realized that he called out, "I've got it!"
She bit me!'
His reading of the key bone was broken," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, 'The shark's in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy's been transferred to a helicopter at Rady's pediatric hospital where his condition is leading to a critical state.
It's not known what kind of sharks attacked him.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in the media that the shark has already been identified in that area a few weeks ago, but it has been determined that it does not belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim had received traumatic injuries in the area of the upper part of the body.
The officials closed access to the beach from the Ponti Beach beach in Casablada to the Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles claimed that there are more than 135 types of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's becomes a competition for boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to share cosmetic products in the style of slave houses in which professional assistants work.
In addition to a significant beauty market in Great Britain of 2.8 billion pounds, which is growing while selling in fashion markets and household equipment, more cosmetics will be tested in 11 sales across the country and will be expanded to more sales next year if they are successful.
To invest in cosmetic products is due to the fact that supermarkets find ways to use police that are sometimes used for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said he would double his cosmetic Assortant by offering more than 3000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brands of L'Oreal, Maybelin and Burt's Bees will also receive more space in departments similar to those in stores like Booths.
The Supermarket will also resume its Boutique makeup line, so most products will be suitable for sale – something more needs young buyers.
In addition, the perfume store Fragrance Shop will test the sales place in two Saninsbury's shops, from which it was first opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, and the other will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
The purchases on the network and the move to buy daily low food in local stores mean that supermarkets need to make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sansbury's chain, said that salesmen will look more like slaves' houses in the pursuit of the supermarket to reverse the launch of the chain with great discounts from Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened the Argos store department in hundreds of their shops, and he also introduced the Habitat department since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sale of food products and the profitability of the acquisition.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its cosmetics and pharmaceutical products has been unsuccessfully completed.
Sainsbury's has tested joint attacks with the Boots launch in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended up fighting about the share of the populace's income in their sales.
The new strategy came into force three years ago after Sainsbury's sold his 281-pothetic company Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds.
It is said that Lloyds will play a role in this plan by adding a further line of luxury products for his skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of the Sansbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beautiful departments to give our buyers a more pleasant environment.
We've also invested in a specially trained colleague who will be at hand to give advice.
Our assortment of brands is designed to meet all the needs, and attractive surroundings and practical places mean that we are now an unfavourable market for beauty that sets new standards in relation to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "sensed" after Holly Willoughby dropped out of the deal worth 11 million pounds.
Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "white" after television director Holly Willoughby withdrew from his personal brand of 11 million pounds to focus on his contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and extra equipment Truly.
The company of this money is engaged with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning (37) emissions leader announced his departure through Instagram.
Holly Willoughby announced the release of Dragons' Den Peter Jones by withdrawing from their profit-effective brand in the last minute – to focus on its new incoming agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV companies.
The sources said that Jones was "white" when a gold girl recognized, during a busy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, in the Buckinghamshire area, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million dollars, meant that there was no time left for their brand of home and additional equipment Truly.
The company was born with Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was expected to double the wealth of Willoughby, which was estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) on Instagram announced his departure, Jones moved from Britain to one of his weekends.
The source said, "Holly put Truly on her own top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would ensure her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has all been included.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
In Marlow's seat there is a lot of products ready for sale."
Scholars believe that the departure of this Morning's emissions leader, who is among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from yachts and worlds to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional delays in launching dates.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined in March as director of the company.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has 40 percent to share in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become Ambassador within the M&S and will replace Anta McPartlin as leader in the ITV Emission I'm A Celebrity.
The source near Jones said last night, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He relied on a critical account that could be obtained from the media because of a comment that could be characterized as "unprecedentary" and because of the positive attitude of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump leave so much?
Trump said to his amazing voice "reading news".
"I didn't even give up."
He found that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump announced their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward to the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "appropriate response" from the US on the first steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he insisted, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure under control.
Trump gave much more positive thought during his speech together.
"We're going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were on the step of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to repair Kim's relationship have brought positive results - the failure of rocket testing, the release of soldiers, and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
And he stood in the defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to behave as presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this whole arena, we'd have about 200 people here," said Trump, pointing to the world ahead of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the deadliest percentages of the island
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said to be unnecessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of the island of Lombok has been replaced, the state of the national disaster has not been declared, which is an excuse for receiving international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear to know that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be too difficult," said Mrs. Sumbong.
While the Save the Children organization consists of a team that will travel to Palu, they are still not sure if a side staff can work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, the national disaster agency's portfolio, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation on the island of Palau to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in the provision of assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, it is tragic how this country is unprepared for the anger of nature.
Even though they're a cave shelter built in Aceh, they're not often seen in other parts of the coast.
It is not likely that there was no sirens for the tsunamis on the island of Palu, although the warning was on the force, so it also led to the loss of life.
And in ideal terms, travel between many Indonesian islands presents challenges.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
The hospital ship settled in Lombok to help the victims of earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Vidodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesian infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has hit Mr. Joko's administration until the next year, expecting new elections.
Mr. Joko was also under pressure because of long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority raised a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives, and tens of thousands have been displaced because of street fighting of Christian and Muslim groups, who have used swords, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Fudbaler Liverpool Daniel Sturridge put in a deep match against Chelsea's football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League in the 89th minute of Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge got a shot from Jerdan Shaqiri on some 30 gardens from Chelsea's naked club while his team lost 1:0.
He moved the ball to his left side and then pushed it to the outside station.
The ball flew high above the penal area, heading up to the top right corner of the network.
At the end, it fell across Cape Arezabalga, who was in the jump and jumped into the net.
"It was only to position, to take the ball, and players like Shaq always go ahead as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself more time," Sturudge said for LiverpoolFC.com.
"He saw Kante coming, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 in half-life after the Belgian star Eden Hazard got hit in 25 minutes.
The Blue Attacker added to the 5th attack a flight of Matte Kovačić before he ran from the middle of the area to Liverpool.
Kovacic hit the ground quickly and returned the ball to the middle of the ground.
Then he made a beautiful cross, pointing Hazard in the prison area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and ended up near stats placed on the left-hand side of Liverpool's leg, except Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napolia in a group phase of the League of Champion in three hours on Wednesday at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.

The number of Indonesian tsunami victims reached 832
The number of Indonesian earthquake and tsunami victims dropped to 832, the state disaster agency announced early Sunday.
A large number of affected people were reported in the destructions of the building, which broke the earthquake of 7.5 power, which happened on Friday and lifted the waves high and up to 20 feet, said the Portal of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the remains of abandoned buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after his wife died.
A murder investigation was initiated following the finding of a woman's body in Birkenhead, the Merseyside area.
A 14-year-old girl was found released at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street Street in the morning, and a 30-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of having committed murder.
The police called on people who were nearby to see or hear something to answer.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early phase, but I call on everyone who was near John Street street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxis, who may have recorded something from the cameras on the car control boards, to contact us because they might possess the information that is important for the investigation."
The police department confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead and found it at home.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the front to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police said they were in the process of informing the victims' families.
The taxi driver who's staying in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that nobody was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He stayed out of text when he found out what happened.
Stans are now told they're gonna have to wait hours before they're allowed to go back in.
They heard a cop said to a man that he was reading the area was considered a crime scene.
One woman came to the crime scene in tears.
She said, "This is so terrible."
In 14 hours, two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van was right next to them.
More police officers were inside the police cordon watching the building.
All who have any information are invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestopers line at 0800 555 111, indicating case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's status in parliament has become the latest reminder of the war on "historic review"
Her removal would represent a poignant justice because of the dispersion of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England, which Taliban managed to execute his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society's proposal, Mr. Cricka, described as "dangerous" and "try to review history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the context of the current debate on the removal of the status, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's character in front of the palace in Westminster became a target.
Cromwell didn't even order, he didn't carry out an iconoology during the English civil war.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the works of his predecessor Thomas of the past century.
The overwhelming demonstration of Cromwell's author Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of the character for which many still believe that it should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell many consider, perhaps by the end of the ninth century, more than today, to protect parliament from external pressures, in his case of monarchy.
Whether this is exactly the subject of a lasting historical discussion.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-seventh century has shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known figure representing one side of these divisions.
His achievements in the property of Lord the protector are also worthy of honor and remembrance."
The killer's pigs brought death wounds to the Chinese farmer.
Swinja attacked and killed a farmer on the market in South West China, reported local media.
A man who only knew that Yuan was rebuffed, found dead with a broken artery and buried blood in a pigeon at a market in the town of Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Swinjar was ready to take the vaccine in June 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He reportedly allowed a relative from the neighbouring area Yunnan in the middle to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of his neighbor's pig was opened.
He said there was a big man pig with blood around his mouth.
Forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighing 550 pounds brought death injuries to the farmer, as reported in the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and broken," said a relative who represented himself as Wu, carrying Guiyang Evening News.
A security record shows Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his family.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the owners of the market are reportedly negotiating a death penalty.
Although rare, the cases of swine attacks on people were marked and earlier.
Swinja attacked his wife and her husband in 2016 on their farm in Massachusetts, where he committed critical injuries to a man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds fell in love with a big farmer with his tractor while his wife didn't panic and scream.
After the pigs ate the Oogon Farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "wig".
"They're just playing.
They like birds, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The rest of Rosa's uranus brings scattered lungs to the southwestern United States
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa failed to move over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring the floods due to the floods along the north coast of Mexico and in the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosini's hurricane's first category reached a speed of 85 miles per hour in the morning after the east time on Sunday, and it was 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, I am formed in the Pacific and move east and west across the United States. As the tropical storm of Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will begin to push the tropical flag north in the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the Tropical Entry, along with the coming wind, will create scattered lungs on the south-west in the next days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, floods and possible storms in the desert.
The high drop will result in floods that will reach locally and 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwestern regions, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of a sudden deterioration of weather conditions and the typical prevalence of tropical rain.
Flying the sands in the desert would be extremely mindless with the danger of tropical rain.
The heavy rain in canyons could result in a split of rivers, and the grasslands, in part, with wind and sandy storm.
The next time I'm here, I'll bring the local raindrops on the parts of the southern California.
There may be a total drop of over half an inch, which could cause nose and neck cramps.
This will be the first rain season in the region.
The room will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rain becomes wider later on Monday and Tuesday.
The pulses will also reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to be around.
In October it can reach large fluctuations of temperature across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, and the trophies still remain quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in short growths.
There is a great example of dramatic differences in temperature in the Central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omahi, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will again try to buy and expand.
The beginning of October will be hot in most of the central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures from around 80 degrees south to north-east.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term forecast of time shows a high possibility of temperature above average in the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bretta Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the exciting witness of Britta Kavanaugh before the high court and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults that occurred in the 1980s, on six television networks.
In the meantime, political unrest continues, with issuers interrupting regular broadcasts due to the latest appeal on Friday: agreement made by Senator Arizona Jeff Blake with the FBI on a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate judicial commission that hundreds of times it's safe to hit Kavanaugh's pipe and try to break up at the high school party.
In the passion story, Kavanaugh said that the hundred percent was sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The numbers were not available immediately for the other networks that issued it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen is usually having trouble picking up people who are following a transfer from the office.
In order to improve, it is a publication similar to that followed by football killings or Oscar's fate.
Fox News Channel, whose editors gave support to Kavanaugh's name, led by other networks with an average number of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, said from Nielsen.
ABC was another with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million, reported from Nielsen.
Interest is high even after hearing.
Flake was the central drama on Friday.
After the Office of the moderated Republican has issued a statement that they will vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS networks have marked the video of the witnesses who were shouting at it after attempting to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He's been looking at it for a few minutes while they hurt him, with the transfer of life to CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power, while many women are weak."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, he had yet to say it at the hearing of the Commission.
The cable and television networks had been transferred to live hours later, while the judicial commission voted whether to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh Senate to vote.
But Flake said he'd only do this under the condition that the FBI investigate charges against what's called the next week, on what's called the minority democracy.
Flake's part of the conversation with a friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few more senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's election was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of playing politics about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of Britain and to undermine national interests in the interview for Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, September 29, 2018.
In a second interview with her on the agenda, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued with an attack on her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal is that Britain and the EU take up one of the other "suspendly absurd".
Killing Waydea Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of killing an LSU player
The police arrested the suspect in a death blow that killed Wayde Sims, a twenty-year-old basketball club in the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and arrested under the charge of a second-party murder, reported from the baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials published videotape between Simms and Simpson and the police said Simpson lost his eyes during the race.
The police took cover from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, says the WAFB network channel CBS.
After Simpson's investigation, the police said he admitted he killed Wayde.
His guarantee was $350,000, a lawyer said.
The Mortgage of the East region of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gun shot in the head and neck.
The department said that the benefits belong to the police working group for the refugees of Louisiana, the criminal police lab, the Southern University police and the local authorities who helped during the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU club Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement agency for "majority and difficulty in justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker was six feet tall and six inches tall in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a boxer in the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps after the sword.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of the LSU Will Wade said that the team was "expected" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"This is what we always worry about," said Wade.
Vulcan throws the ashes out of Mexico City.
Pepeo, who's blushing volcano Popocatepetl, has arrived in the southern squares of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay in safe distance after the volcanic activity in the crater increased and after 183 gas emissions were recorded and dropped in 24 hours.
The center's been following more passions and silences.
Pictures on the social media show the thin layer of dust covering the air cars in Mexico City's squares, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity of 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital since the earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police have struggled with catalytic separatists following the referendum on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after the prosecutors, the authorities of independence, fought with a special police warrant, when thousands of people joined in opposition demonstrations because of the marking of the year's polarising Catalan referendum on abortion.
A group of masked separatists, held by the special police department, threw them with eggs and colors in the dust, creating dark cloud clouds of dust on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, they broke out with a police officer who used pendders to stop the strike.
The independence summits have been scheduled for hours, "There's no forgetting, no forgiveness" and have fought against the allies of the Union who called themselves "Special Life".
Forty persons received medical treatment for fewer injuries received in the protests, reported local press.
Tensions are still high in the region, which was set up for independence a year after the first October referendum that Madrid declared illegal, but which catalytic separatists praised.
The voters have generally chosen independence, although the outcome has been low because the opposition to the recognition of the minority have fought against the referendum.
According to the information provided by the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 persons have been injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote on violent conflicts in the voting areas of the region.
Groups that claim independence campaigned on Friday evening to prevent demonstrations and provide support to the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist sermons with his wife, said that he was no longer optimistic about catalytic independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for happiness because they were allowed to vote, but we're in the script now," he said.
Although they have taken the key, but a firm victory in the local elections of last December, the Catalan parties fighting for independence have had difficulty holding back because some of their most prominent leaders are in self-defense exile or detention, awaiting trial for their role in the referendum organisation, and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 14-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a police-supported statement on the phone, said politicians on both sides supported conflicts.
"There's a lot of tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidate in the elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy in European elections is the best way to judge the backlog of democratic values and the repressions that the Spanish authorities have forced us," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after they were killed in the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after more than one car had been killed in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in the Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday about 19:30 after the British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said he's lost his hat as well as the building itself.
There's a chance that at one moment on the car was shot out of the plane.
Menge's hit Livingston won 1:0 against Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menge was to win for Livingston.
The advanced Livingston surprised Rangers and noticed only another loss for Steven Gerrard at the 18th Ibrox club.
Gol Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was compared to Hibernate in another place.
Gerard's club has not noticed any victory in the guests in the Premier League this season and will play against the first-plasted Hearts for which eight points remain next week.
Before that, Rangers will attack the Rapid from Becha in the sword of the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has passed a series of winnings in six matches, and chief coach Holt hasn't experienced the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed an opportunity against a guest who had lost his skin.
Holt's team had to be in charge a lot earlier than they were giving up because their direct game was very problematic for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but his attempt went past the floor, then the attempt by Alan Lithgrow went beyond the floor after he pulled out to get the ball that Craig Halket had moved his head to the floor.
It was appropriate for domestics to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free strikers.
And that's how it's achieved and the key goal.
A free strike against Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Mango, who got a ball and hit from the middle of the criminal space.
By that time Rangers had dominated the estate of the ball, but the defense of the household remained unwarranted and the naked Liam Kelly had no problem.
That form continued in the second half of the year, although Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the foot of Rangers Allan McGregor's golf course, and Lithgow was exaggerating from another free shot for Livingston.
The Croseis went continuously to Livingstone's penal area and were spared, while two of the prisoners they were looking for – one after the failure of the replacement player Glenna Middleton, and the other because of the game's hand – were not assigned.
"Fenomenal Game" Livingstone – analysis
BBC Scotland, Alaskar Lamont is in Tony Macaroni arena
The famous game and the result of Livingstone.
All up to one was great, and they continue to overcome expectations on the way out.
Their style of games and players have certainly not changed from their return to the top, but great rewards belong to Holt, who gives the team the energy from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was great, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga was not giving peace to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrll.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As long as they were good at the time under Gerard's flag, they didn't get that grade.
There were no final hits – only one time they crossed the household line – and this is the kind of call for Rangers' wake-up on the middle table.
A mixed reception for Erdogan in Kelne
Saturday (29 September) was marked by a smile and a blue sky as the Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan German, whose aim is to reform NATO relations.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then sailed to Kelne to open a huge new jami.
This is the city in which the largest number of Turks live in Turkey.
The police took security measures as a reason to block the collection of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many delegates gathered near to see their president.
Hundreds of witnesses against Erdogan – many of them Kurdi – were also voting, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to grant him a welcome visit to the country.
The two stories reflect the division in the opinions of the guest of whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others point out what a car is.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicyclelist died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
By the end of the day, it had reached the vicinity of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road to Deptford, on the southeastern city, about 10:15 after the British time.
The driver stopped and intervened by the emergency relief team, but the man died on the spot.
It happened a few months after the other biker died in an accident in which the driver left the accident site, in the Childers Street street, which was about a mile away from the place of the Saturday accident.
The London police said they were working on the identification of victims and family information.
Streets are closed, buses are overrun, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six employees injured in accidents
Six prison officials were injured in a high-security prison for men, reported from the Prison Office.
The order went out in Long Lartin prison, in the Worcestershire area, on Sunday about 09:30 in British time, and they still live.
The Special Service of the "Tornado" has been called to calm down with eight guards participating in one of the prisons.
The staff received fewer facial injuries, and help was given to them face-to-face
Portal of the prison administration said: "We have prepared a specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident that is in the course of the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received medical assistance because of the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the police will be responsible for it and that they may be punished."
Long Lartin prison is located in more than 500 prisons, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator was admitted to a hospital treatment after he was attacked by the prisoner.
And in October last year, a special unit was called in prison for serious irregularities in which personnel were attacked by billiard bullets.
Uragan Rosa warns to swim Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lat City (which can be useful in areas covered by drought)
Very rarely when tropical depression strikes Arizona, but that is exactly what will likely happen at the beginning of the next week while hurricane Rosa passes through its rest of its energy through desert southwestern provinces, carrying its risk from the floods.
The National Meteorological Administration has already issued a warning for the floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, South California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will be announced on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix has been tweeting that it has only been "ten tropical cycles since 1950." It has held the status of tropical storms or depression in the circle of 200 miles around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles away from the Arizona border."
The most recent projections of the National Centre for Uragan forecast 2 to 4 inland waterways and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inland areas.
In the rest of the desert south-east, including the central portion of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it will be most likely to be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there is no fear of the flood, Rosina rain could be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be of benefit because the Southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the information provided by the U.S. Surveillance Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by a minimum of extreme drought, another highest category," said weather.com.
First on his way, the hurricane Ross will lead to the cliché on the Mexican island of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the force exerted by the winds of 85 miles an hour on Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and will move quickly from 12 miles an hour.
The oil will reach the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and it will start to rain.
It is therefore expected that Mexico will be hit by the forces of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
The lungs in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could represent a great risk of floods.
"A total of three to six inches are expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonore, and perhaps even to 10 inches," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through the power of the tropical storm before arriving in Arizona early in the morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah in the afternoon late evening.
"The main danger expected by Rose or her remains are large floods in Baja California, the northwestern Sonori and the South West American desert," they said from the National Centre for Uraganas.
These lungs are expected to cause life-threatening rainwaters and noses in the deserts, as well as cliffs in mountain regions.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage men and two-year-olds were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a six-year-old was found beaten in Somerset.
The teenagers found a wounded man near the streets of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 o'clock in the morning after the British time.
She's taken to the hospital and she's in a stable state.
Seventeen-year-olds, two eight-year-olds and twenty-year-olds were arrested in Radstock's area, reported from the Avon and Somerset police.
Officials are calling to respond to those who have any video on the mobile phone.
The trumpet said that Kavanaugh's "petition and anger" democratic party
"The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against cruel and unsolicited tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wellling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "sustained the subsistency and anger" of the democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress on Thursday, strong and emotionally disproved Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually assaulted several decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed hearing of his charges.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw a miracle, quality and courage" in Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most outstanding legal concepts of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," said a group of delegates in West Virginia.
The President indirectly touched on the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the Republican exit of elections in the middle of the mandate.
"Five weeks of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I don't apply for myself, I actually do." He said.
"That's why I fight all over for great candidates."
The trumpet claims that democracy continues to "response and oppose."
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, the High Commissioner of the Republican Party for CNN said.
Hundreds have lost their lives in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to grow.
At least 384 people died, many of them gathered with huge waves that hit the beaches, when large earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered because of the festivals on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves reached up to six feet (18 feet) and hit the shore in the summary, referring to many to death and destroying everything they found their way.
After the earthquake, the tsunami hit 7.5.
"When the threat from the tsunami was announced yesterday, people still took their jobs on the beach and didn't get away immediately, and they got caught," Sutopo Purwo Nugro said, the Indonesian disaster management agency's portfolio in Jakarti.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he carried cars, balloons, houses, hit everything on his head," said Nugro, adding that he traveled through the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before he hit the coast.
Some people fell on trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people are evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palau.
Air photographs issued by the disaster agency show the number of destroyed buildings and shops, sandy and damaged bridges and the jemmies surrounded by water.
The promotions continued to talk about the football town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) reported that the energy of large-scale earthquakes on Friday was 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb power dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical location of the city, located on the edge of a long, narrow lake, increased the force of tsunamis, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as an "immortal" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels were broken down.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be more than 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donghe area, which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely detached without any information" from Dondre, Nugro said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," they said at the Red Cross in the announcement, adding that they are their personnel and volunteers on the way to the threatened areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticised because it did not report that the tsunami hit Palau, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records distributed on social networks show men on the top floor that people on the street are being warned by panic attacks on the coming shadows.
Within a few minutes, the wall of the water hit the coast, carrying its buildings and cars.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
Landjotres and tsunamis have caused a lack of electricity that has cut off communication about the Palu, requiring rescue efforts by the authorities.
The military started sending pregnant planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuees still needed food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo ordered a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims dropped more than 800.
It's so bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization had certainly arrived from Donghe in Palu, where employees were located in the tents raised in the office yard, they testified to the sights of the raiding on the road, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's so bad.
Even when relief groups began to take the first steps to mitigate the disaster, the complaint was that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the impact of foreign resources, stocks and people can only be achieved if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the Ukrainian level," said Aulia Ariani, the portal of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we will be open for international assistance, but that status has not yet been announced."
As the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis falls on Palau Friday, friends and family still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their exciting story in this natural disaster will be reduced.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the debris next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandon, a trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing pairs of Asian children who were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoners in Roa Roa Roa's hotel, including Mr. Mandanga, were his students.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel spread to the circles of the paraglider desperately sent whatsApp messages to the contestants in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, had only one gray box, instead of two blue boxes.
"I think it means that messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while filling the banks in the Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, the police report in Newport stole $26,750 from Brikka's employer, who filled the banknotes in Newport on the Levee.
The driver of the car was empty in a fun complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in his release.
While he was busy, the other man came after the Brin's employee and stole the bag of money he was supposed to be delivered.
The Witnesses saw more suspects running away from the scene, standing in the press, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: reper my name in Ye
Reper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Publishing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "It'll be previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time under the Y template and has used the name for the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change came before his event at the Saturn Day Night Live show, where the promotion of his new Yandhi album is expected.
He replaced the singer Arian Grande, who rejected the "emotional reasons", said the author of the show.
In addition to the summary of his current professional name, West said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," said West earlier this year while discussing the title of the album with the radio director Big Boye.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us.
She was born from Kanye, which means only Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more reflective of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West's co-operation, JAY-Z, has also used versions with or without hints and big words.
AMLO in Mexico vowed not to use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised that he would never use the military force against civilians as the country nears fifty years of blood transfusions against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to punish the Mexican people."
The military launched a peaceful demonstration on the market on October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people during the time the left-wing students moved to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of access to education among young people in criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artistic intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artistic intelligence, the United States should double the cost of research in that field, said the investor and practical artist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the American authorities issued an announcement of artistic intelligence, although the United States does not have a formal strategy in the field of artistic intelligence.
Meanwhile, China had announced its plan: their goal was to be first in the domain of innovation of artistic intelligence by 2030.
"The bilateral budget for artistic intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are very behind the United States, and we are looking for a new challenge in the field of artistic intelligence," Lee said.
The two-founded funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artistic intelligence will occur in the United States, Lee said in an interview for the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Supusers of Art Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Council" published the publishing house Hughton Mifflin Harcourt this month, executive director of the Synovation Ventures company, who joined one of the most impressive companies of art intelligence in China, Face+.
He was in the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University on a system of artistic intelligence that appeared to be higher than the most ranked American Othello player, and later he was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese border Google.
Lee gave recognition to the former US government technological competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when they planned the next competitions to be identified by future spectators.
Researchers in the United States often have to make huge efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"We don't take China's academic leaders, they're doing corporate work," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technological companies have worked great individuals at the university in recent years to work on artistic intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artistic intelligence.
"I think it should automatically offer green cards to doctors in the field of art intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan to develop the artistic intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants grants to people in academic institutions the same way that the National Educational Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Department of Defence has formed the Joint Centre for Art Intelligence, which seeks to involve partners from industry and academic communities, and White House has announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Art Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of two billion dollars for an initiative under the name AI Next.
With regard to the National Educational Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million annually in research on artistic intelligence.
Meanwhile, the American legislation which sought to form a national security Commission for artistic intelligence for months is not taking over.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name in the "North Republic of Macedonia", a step that would resolve the multi-decenic dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO Union.
Greece, which has a province on behalf of Macedonia, claims that their northern neighbour's name represents the ownership of its territory and has placed a pledge on their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the name proposed in June, but the nationalist opponents claim that this could endanger the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavonics in Macedonia.
President Dr. Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised questions as to whether the referendum would result in at least 50 per cent of the referendum that would be necessary for the referendum to be relevant.
The question on the voter list was: "Are you for NATO membership and the EU with agreement with Greece?"
The amendments to the call, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries, has experienced in the breakup of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, to be able to live freely within the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that the voting results would be handed down and that the outcome would be decisive.
In order to change the name, there would be a need for a double majority in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission stated that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the output was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the voters were elected.
"I've come to vote for my children, it's our place in Europe," said Djuose Tanevski (62), a spokesman in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dosko voted in the Macedonian referendum on the change of names, which could open their way to membership in the NATO Union and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small bin and pulled the chairs in front of the tent, which the people would fight the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to take part in raising our heads, not at the last door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud country.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the European Community."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would be provided with the necessary investment in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote 'for' because it is more than 80 percent of our EU-NATO housing," Zaev said after posting a list.
He said the result "for" would be "the confirmation of our future."
A survey published on Monday at the Macedonian Research Institute shows that 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary headings.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of researchers plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote "for."
In order to make the referendum successful, an exit of 50 per cent plus one vote is required.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious hit on the Western Government since it came to power last May.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through a wide range of Bridgeton defenses and reaches the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling solved the defences of Brighton in the victory of 2:0 Manchester City against Brighton at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It was very easy when Aguero reached the floor in 65 minutes.
Argentinian attacker got a ball in the middle of the area at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three defense players Brighton before he found himself in an open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green flowers.
He ran around a defense player, and he was faster than a few more on the edge of Bridgeton's hill.
Then he added it to the left side, finding Sterling.
The English attacker used his first shot in the penal area to return to the Aguera fighter, who ruled the Golman Brighton Matthew Ryan on the right side of the network.
"Aguero had some foot problems," said coach Pep Guardian reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's right.
We're happy he got naked at that time."
But Sterling was the one who gave the skyscrapers the initial advantage in the Premier League.
He got naked in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero got a ball deep in Brighton's part of the land.
It's great to add Leroy Sane to the left side.
Sane touched several times before sending Sterling to the floor.
The skystormer shot a ball in the net before he stepped out of the field.
City fights against Hoffneheim in the group phase of the League champion at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game with no game to win against Rockies.
Since the Nationals was eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But the game-based Scherzer hopes to take a position on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if they are Rockies, who have a preference game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still playing.
At least Rockies have a direct pass due to the victory of 5:2 against the Nationals on Friday, but they still try to win the first title in the league.
"Although it didn't play for anything, at least we can go out on the ground knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver will be likely at the highest level in relation to all the other years.
Why do I not want to compete in these conditions?"
Nationals still need to publish the initial team for the week, but they're obviously willing to let Scherzer drop in that situation.
Scherzer, who would have been 34 times to start the game, trained on Thursday and will be fired on Sunday when he usually retired.
The right side of Washington's water 18:7 this season for the average wounded wound from 2,53, 300 stanzas in 220 2/3 inhalers.
The trumpet was held in West Virginia.
The president briefly turned his attention to the situation around the election of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the Republican exit to the elections on half of the mandate.
"All we've done will be on the cat in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the great, great – although I didn't actually apply for a candidate because I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
The trumpet continued, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of radical democracies, that's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using all possible ways, see evil, unclean games.
It is not for those who will hurt, who will go astray in order to gain power and control, power and control, that is what they want, and We will not give them [to others].
Democrats, he said, are in the mission "response and opposition."
"And you've seen it in the past four days," he said, calling democratics "dangerous, cruel, evil and inexhaustible."
He named a democratic senator and a member of the Senate judicial commission, Diane Feinstein, on behalf of which the public was moved to vote.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you left the document in public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I wait; it was indeed the most terrible tongue of the body I've ever seen."
The Laburist Party no longer accepts different positions.
It's non-normal to those who express their opinions
When the Moment activists at my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
Secondly, I am the last of the laburistic members of parliament who were told that they were not welcome, and all because of what we have been looking for.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she strongly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for not associating with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
A summary of a meeting of the range of lab partners in Nottingham East, held on Friday, is "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years that I spent as a local lab member of Parliament, the meetings on Friday evening were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not the same as the promise of a "lover, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it ever happened.
It has become even more evident that the different opinions do not tolerate in the lab party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leaders of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when the colleagues I believed to share similar political positions began to expect me to make the 180-step and take the positions I would never agree with, whether it is a matter of national security or the single market of the European Union.
Always when I speak publicly – and it's not important what I say – that's followed by the abuse on social networks, calls for the removal of the party, the criticisms of the central policy, and they tell me that I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And that's not just happening to me.
On the contrary, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because comments directed to me are mainly political nature.
I'm impressed by professionalism and the decision-making of my colleague who carries with her every day sexual or racist injuries, but she doesn't withdraw.
One of my greatest frustrations in this political era is how these levels of injury have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the lab party should be a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer parties that accept different positions and any vote of distrust or change of the rules of the party's election.
I've got a lot of advice and last two years, they've been trying to get me to hit my head, I'm less loud, and then I'm gonna be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Laburist Party 32 years ago, the government of the Prime Minister of Thatcher, because my primary school teacher had literally run away, I had to make sure that better public services were available to those who were most needed, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I've never covered my policy, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political positions and the areas of non-compliance with the current leadership.
Those who supported the proposal on Friday I would like to tell you that, when the country comes to Brexit that will threaten households, jobs and our public services, I don't understand why someone would lose time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the lab party.
But the main message that I have is not addressed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my election unit, whether they are members of the lab party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that I will not prevent the threat of removal from the party or political swindlers from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undiscovered Ayr on top
Two late attempts may have just described the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has brought a deserved victory in this exciting game of days at Tennt's Prime Minister League.
Now they're on the top of the table, the only undamaged by ten teams.
In the end, the household team won the victory thanks to the superior defense, as well as a larger number of the opportunities used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason for satisfaction.
"We're already tested in the games, and we're still undetected, so I need to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Air all honor, they used their opportunities better than us."
Try Grant Nadersona in 14 minutes, which transformed Frazier Climo, gave Ayr's advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who left the Warriors to play, allowed Melrose to use the digital advantage and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted attempt.
The climate has increased the leadership of Ayra before, just before a half-time, it was achieved to turn the solo attempt into a hit for a score of 17:5 for Ayr for a half-time.
But Melrose, another half-time started well and tried Patrick Anderson, who transformed Baggot, reduced his leadership to five points.
Then came a long break because of the serious injuries of Ruridha Knotta, which had been removed on the noses, and Ayr continued to increase the privilege of trying Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Captain Ayra's replacement, Blair Macpherson, then got a yellow card, and Melrose re-used the digital overture with an unprocessed attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of severe pressure.
However, the housekeepers returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for the fall on Climp without a ball, MacPherson got a touch down with the penalty drawing behind Ayra's coming.
Climo turned, as it has done almost since the beginning of the attack, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's hit in the prison space and sent Gregor Henry's wing for five domestic attempts.
Still game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still game, Ford Kieran, is ready to go to the catering industry after discovering that it is designated as director of licensed restaurants.
Fifteen-year-old Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series for which he writes a scenario and plays with his long-term partner in comedys, Greg Hemphill.
The two said the presence of the nine seasons would be the last in the series and Kiernan seems to be planning life after Craiglong.
According to the official record, he is the director of the company Affymorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun newspaper insisted that Kiernan wanted to join the "increasing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The Navy patrols the seabed in La Paz.
In public buildings, the oceanscopoeia is a threat.
The coastal bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to the sea is our commitment."
The region of the capital of Bolivia is still a strong memory of the coast that has been lost in the use of Chile in the bloody waters of natural resources in the ninth century – as well as the attempt to refish the Pacific.
These hopes may be the biggest in the past few decades, while Bolivia is expecting the International Court of Justice for the first five years following its appeal.
"Bolivia has caught the flag, in the spirit of unity and harmony, and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia and assert that – after decades of Greek negotiations – Chile must agree to talks on providing Bolivia with a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here Morales, the charismatic ill-treatment president of the home-born family, who is presenting a controversial struggle for the re-election next year, also has a major role when it comes to the verdict that will be delivered on Monday.
"We're very close to the return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia, and that it will change little even if it decides.
The United Nations body, with its seat in the Netherlands, is not empowered to extend the Chilean territory and has claimed that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the trial is only six months after the last arguments have been heard indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of making progress in a painful case, the last four years may have left him behind.
"The problem of access to the sea has taken over the current disease authorities," said Zarate.
The Morales War Department killed the rest of Chilean's good will, it's clear.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at once, but it will be very difficult to maintain those negotiations after this.
These two countries have not changed Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in Hagu, rejected the idea that the court's decision is unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "put a point at 139 years of absence on the obstetricity," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the question of going to sea as a political stock.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to go out on the Pacific," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't be until they can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will not eliminate nuclear weapons until they believe Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to respect the promises of data during a summit in Singapore between the opposing leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to be on the border to reopen nuclear talks, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong One from North Korea.
Ri says it's just empty dreams that the continued sanctions and opposition of the US declaration that the Korean War will ever throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pjongjang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and American President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government is a sceptic when the matter of the seriousness of Pjongjanga is about the withdrawal of a nuclear arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the second Kima and Trump summit.
The latest lines of large hats that you will soon see in the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely block the sun, you're on the right spot.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of huge hats on their summer and summer 2019 magazines, replacing everything at the Paris Week of Fashion.
This summer's Instagram was won by extremely inactivative hats, and these designers showed their impressive creations in modern letters.
The most powerful Valentin's piece was an overstated hat with a wide pernicious area that had broken the heads of the model.
Among the rest of the glamorous additions, there's a velvet stone, magic hat, and even ananas, but their intentions are not to keep your head from cold.
Thom Browne also introduced a collection of strange masks and that was right at the time of the night of the witch.
Many of the charmed masks had a sharp lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than in high fashion.
One creature looked like a rosary with a disalke and a mask, and the other reminded of a cornet with a heated ice cream.
And if you are of those who follow the right course, you will be successful.
Those who follow the fashions predict that huge cuts could be found on nearby trading streets.
The huge hats came after "La Bombe", a broken hat with an area of two feet that has been seen on many stars, from Rihanne to Emily Rattakowski.
The cultural brand who invented this very ineffective hat that had crossed the social networks, sent another great creature on the bridge — a silver-plated beach bag that was almost as big as the model he wore.
The Sagasitanaranjsty bag of raffia with resam and white skin gloves was printed in detail by Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at the Paris Week of Fashion.
The famous writer Luke Armitage said to the F.D.: "I expect great cuts and bags for the beach to reach the store in the next year, since the designer left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-dimensioned fashion supplements."
John Edward: Knowing the language is of key importance to citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be commended for outstanding academic achievement, which also continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding results on the studies, which is further strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school that represents the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strives to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools continue to prepare students for further education, selected careers and a place in the society of the world’s citizens.
As an educational sector that can think and implement its own development plan and programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you're talking to a man in a language that he understands, he's already in his head.
If you talk to him in his language, that's his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year's survey, we see that the languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest transitional estimates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages received A at the final secondary school exam.
Data collected from 74 SCIS students showed that 72% of students received an A in Mandarin in the final exam in the secondary school, while 72% of those who learned German, 69% of those who learned French, and 63% of those who were learning Spanish, also received an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Language, as selective objects, is now treated in the same way as STEM objects (natural science, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in programmes of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that in 17 per cent of the reason employers pointed to the difficulties of filling jobs was just a few of those who know language.
So knowing foreign languages becomes increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
In addition to the more potential business for which foreign language is needed, this skill is necessary in the world of globalization.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he knows another language, he will have a real advantage in the future because it's a skill for the rest of his life.
The arts of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically place a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to YouGo's survey of more than 4,000 British people in 2013, 75 percent did not know to speak another language well enough to conduct a conversation while French was the only language spoken by bicifrese, 15 percent.
That's why investing in learning foreign languages is important for children today.
Knowing more languages, especially those who use economies in development, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
Every school in Scotland is different when it comes to language learning.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be a few languages that you can choose from in independent schools, with a professional staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to ensuring the learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need for success, whatever they expect in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages have a key meaning for the future of the country, so that this must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered "International Communication Skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
You have to do it.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron's going to debate for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Waiting is about to end for fans who want to see LeBron James's first move for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play Sunday in the presidential match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he still doesn't know how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, suspected James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training this week, James asked about plans in six games during President Lakers.
"At this stage my careers are not necessary for me to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's collection in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began a series of re-elections tonight at Weiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump's banned groups in the next week, including visiting friendly facilities such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his vote is pending for a full seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
When's Trump's collection in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is banned for seven hours after the east time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's collection in West Virginia under the transfer of life on YouTube.
The trumpet will probably talk about hearings this week regarding the appointment of Bretta Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court in which the charges for sexual harassment have been filed, and the expected vote in the Senate has been postponed for seven days until the FBI has conducted the investigation.
But the transitional objective of this series is to help the Republicans achieve a better outcome on the elections in November.
As a result, President Trump's campaign said that this week's summits are being held to "give the energy to volunteers and representatives while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the people they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The Congress's control is so key part of its agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we can enter the pre-election campaign season," said Reuters Port-Paol Trump's campaign that he refused to introduce.
In the Westbanko Areni, in Wheeling, the evening group could gather the exhibits from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and draw attention to the media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second time this month, Trump will visit West Virginia, the country in which he won more than 40 percent points in 2016.
The troops are trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is not well placed in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came here to try to raise him up in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to the Reuters report.
Ryder Buy 2018.: The US team has shown the struggle to keep hope before the single match on Sunday
After three single sessions, Thursdays on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder tap needed.
It's quite easy to imagine the concept of sports, but one of those in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got the back?
"Six points have been taken, and now four, so it can be said that it's behind us," Jordan Spieth said on his way.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of four more, with another twelve in the game.
Americans, as Spieth says, still believe that they have some wind in their wings, and there are a lot of what they provide encouragement, between the rest of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together for a whole day, and each took three points from the possible four.
Spieth was great from the first to the last hit and led his example.
The fans of the celebration became more louder during his rounds to finally play a key hit for the unsolved result in the fourth match when he and Thomas left for two after two.
His final hit with a 15-pound sword was expected by a similar call, one that reflects the belief that the American team has hope.
"You just have to give everything out of yourself and take care of your sword," said Spieth.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players from more than Spietha and Thomas' points in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder's shop.
It's unusual, but an unfathomable European couple got all four swords and games without mistakes.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't play the gods on Saturday afternoon, and they escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game that they have shown so far has also shown a way to exchange energy with the botanical public, they have identified them as the main favorites on Sunday and no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinary could take the potential European win while the sun is at the top of the Le Golf National territorial club.
It would be best both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about a European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ruled Sergey Garcia, a hero game with four volts that morning when he played in pairs with Alex Noren.
One divine strike and two doubles in the first nine holes buried Spain and Sweden in a hole from which they had never succeeded in getting the source.
However, on Sunday no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four volts and four is so fascinating to look at the proximity due to the interaction between couples, advice that they give and that they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has so far played better and has a great advantage before the final day, but this session has shown four times that the US team has a desire to fight in which some have doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe runs 10:6 before the last day Ryder buys
Europe will finally enter Ryder's bathroom with a significant advantage, since after Saturday's games in the game with four volts and four-quarters won the U.S. preference of 10.6 over the United States.
In the hope of a couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, he took the first two victories over the undisputed Tiger Woods, which has increased the current score at the Le Golf National clubs on four points.
European Thomas Bjorn in the fight to recover the trophies that lost in the Hazeltine Club two years ago, dominated the inappropriate Americans in the morning game with four volts and won the 3:1 series.
The United States has given more resistance to the tournament of four, winning two swords, but they have not been able to reduce the remainder.
The Jim Furyk team has to win eight points in 12 single matches a week to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European debitant who won four points in advance, while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a fantastic weekend, only another couple in the history of Ryder's cup that won four points in the first four matches.
After they crossed Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four volts, they were well-compounded and dominated by the tired Woods and American debater Bryson Dechambeau with even worse 5:4.
Woods, who escaped on Saturday through two swords, was caught at the moment, but now he lost 19 of the 29 swords in the game with four bullets and four of them and seven of them.
Justton Rose, who retired during the morning game with four volts, returned to Henry Stanson's partner on the four-day tournament and suffered defeat 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third of the world.
Europe has not yet reached the end of this pleasant winter in the southwestern part of Paris.
The Trotastic winner of the main tournament Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They chose the victory of 2:1 over Jonah Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game with four volts, to return and win Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4:3 in the four, after they lost the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder's buy some team came back after the rest of the four points in front of a single match, although Fury's side, which protects the title, is an unsolved result to keep the trophies.
However, after two days on the other side, it seems that we could not make the day-to-week counterattack.
North Korea tells "no speech" about one side of the dispute if it doesn't trust
In Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister said to the United Nations that the promotion of the sanctions produces its distrust in the United States and that in such circumstances the country will rather not simply give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu said at the UN General Assembly last year that North Korea has taken "significant measures to show good will", such as the interruption of nuclear and rocket testing, the detonation of nuclear policy and the promise that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology will not be involved.
"However, there are no corresponding reactions to the US," he said.
"With no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no word of disappointment at first."
Although Ri reiterated the known charges of North Korea against Washington's "progressive" approach to denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pjung did earlier.
Ri was invited to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trumpa at the first meeting held between the current president of the United States and North Korea's leader on June 12th in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the "Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump agreed to provide North Korea with security assurance.
North Korea is seeking the formal end of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pjongjang must first surrender his nuclear weapons.
Washington also listened to the call to slow down the international sanctions of North Korea.
"The United States will not give up 'denuclearization before everything' and increase the level of pressure on sanctions in order to achieve their goal, even against 'declaring the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can cast us on our knees is the empty dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the sanctions that have been imposed produce our distrust."
Ri didn't mention plans for another summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader spoke to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister attended three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If we negotiate this problem with South Korea, rather than with the US, the Korean peninsula's denuclearization would not be such an unexplained position."
However, the tone of Riogo's speech was radically different from last year's, when at the UN General Assembly he said it was inevitable that the invasion of the American field of North Korea rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Zli's President" Trump called Kim "racates" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for her courage to take steps to disarm, but he said that many more must do so and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea does not implement denuclearization.
In the middle, Trump said he didn't set a time frame for this, saying, "If it's necessary, let it last two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should pay Pjongjang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The Security Council's sanctions must continue to be severe and without being allowed to be carried out until they reach complete, final, confirmed denuclearization".
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea, which have been applied since 2006, in an attempt to fund the financing of the nuclear and ballistic missiles programme in Pungjang.
Pompeo met with Riym van General Assembly of the United Nations and then said he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not gone well.
In July he left Pjongjang with the words that he had made progress, and North Korea condemned him after just a few hours because of the "gangster demands".
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, promised to detonate a rocket polygon as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "responsive measures".
He said Kim told him that "responsible measures" that required security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to make students more sleepy in an effort to heal the increasingly popular cat culture of learning "all night with the help of caffeine".
One academic observed that students of the leading university in the world are often unaware of their basic concerns.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist Brigham and Women's Hospital, created a course for which he considers to be the only type in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course was given after a speech that had a bearing on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of the day a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this just now, in my birthday?'
She said that no one ever told her how important the dream was – which surprised me," he said for The Telegraph.
The course that holds students this year for the first time provides the basis for how good sleep habits bring better academic and sports results, as well as improved their overall status.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was noted that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
A simple course covers a range of interactive tasks.
In one part, the picture of a room in a student's home and students should click on a school for coffee, vegetables, pastries and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleeplessness on the athletic performance and the meaning of the routines before sleeping.
In the second part, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not change the behavior of the students at the moment.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects it has on smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride because of the "sudden night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technologies and increased pressure on students have led to a lack of sleep become more and more problems.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that quality, should be "tight weapons" of students in the fight against stress, convulsions and anxiety, he said – even against higher kilograms, since the result of lack of sleep goes into the cooling system, so they are always hungry.
Raymond So, a nine-year-old student of chemistry and physics in California, helped Professor Czeisler to figure out a course after he attended one of his lectures during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to make sure he kept his entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step is that all postgraduate students are asked to pass a similar study programme before the competition institution is reached.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up a time for sleep and wake-up alarms and that they manage the accounts on the harmful effects of "white light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, and also lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengingo gol is the defeat of Gerard's team
The Rangers experienced another depression in the guests when Dolly Menga sent a huge team of Steven Gerrard to the scene at 1:0 from Livingstone.
The team of Ibrox wanted to win the first win in the guests after the February triumph of the 4th in St Johnstone, but the group of Gary Holt hired Gerard as manager only second in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the missing leaders of the Ladbrokes Premier League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-life, and the uninspired state of Rangers never came close.
While the Rangers are now falling in six places, Livingston falls on the third and behind the hibernations are just because of the difference.
Rangers could face additional problems after the linear court of Calum Spence had to show assistance when they shot him on the side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that stopped Ayr and made it into the semi-final Betfred.
On the other hand, Holt arranged for the same eleven Livingstone players who had taken over the Hearts last week and would be thrilled by the way his well-trained team pressed opponents on every step.
The Rangers may have dominated the horse's possession, but Livingston better used his time with the ball.
It was a bit of a failure to reach the goal just two minutes after Manga sent Scott Pittman to the top of the hill Allan McGregor, but the middle-field player missed a lot of chance and walked around the corner.
The deep-free Keaghan Jacobs strike then found Captain Craig Halketta, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow just managed to sneak around the corner, the end of the stats.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should get a gun in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless agreed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers only made two hits on the ground in the first half of the first half, but the former Golman Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no major problems defending the hit on Lassane Coulibaly's head and stole the shot that led Ovie Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livingstone in 34 minutes may not have reflected the real relationship of power during the game, no one can deny that he was deserved, if not for anything else, then because of his hard work.
The Rangers couldn't choose with a deep free shot Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the bat to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Mengo for a simple finish.
Gerrard responded to the interruption of the introduction of Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and this exchange almost gave the result when a screen player hired Morales, but impressive Kelly touched his lines and blocked him.
Livingston, however, has continued to point out guests to play exactly the way they deserve, with the long shots of Lithgow and Halketta.
Holt's team had the chance to increase the advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor kept himself well and protected Jacobs' attack so that then Lithgow would send a bullet out of his head.
The replacement player Rangers, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, asked for another pen when he joined Jacobs, but Thomson didn't respond again.
Almanah: Immigrants of Geigerov's Broker
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, today at today's 136 years ago... the day that former physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an exception that will eventually become a device known as Geiger's number.
Besides being one of the main sources of science, Geiger's journalist has his place and in the pop culture, such as in the 1950's "Call Coronada" film, where he was played by amazing Cuban scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man says, "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's number, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put those listeners, you can hear the effects of atoms using radioactivity in minerals."
Evans said, "Yes, that's a dick!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the stranger who bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" criminal cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" the criminal cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches immunological system to recognize the harmful cells during therapy
The procedure includes the introduction of immunological cells from patients and their transformation into the laboratory
They can then "see" protein that is common in many types of carcinomas, and then they re-exact.
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of a woman's ovary who received treatment from a vaccine that teaches the immunological system to recognize a criminal cell has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the removal of immunological cells from the patient, their transformation into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein HER2, and their re-injection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Small Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2 "helps growth in several species of carcinomas" including breast cancer, egg, lungs and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
Similar access to the management of immunological cells from patients and the "learning" of the same way that the target of small cells was effective in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West has kept a tight voice of support from Trump, wearing MAGA hats, after his performance in the SNL issue.
He didn't get through well.
Kanye West was a student during a Saturday Night Live show after a great event in which US President Donald Trump said he would be running in 2020.
After the execution of his third song called Ghost Town, during the evening he wore a cap with the title "Make America the Great", he wounded Democrats and once again spoke of his support for Trump.
"How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
Well, if I was interested in racism, I'd have been moving from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started the show with a sketch that played by Matt Damon and in which the Hollywood star ridicules the testimony of Bretta Kavanaugh before the Senate justice commission regarding claims of sexual harassment Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it's not broadcast, West speech's video was shared by Commissioner Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear whether Rock tried to draw the West by setting up a video.
West also complained to the public that it was hard behind his neck for coffee.
"They've hit me behind bars.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
I've been tortured!
And then they say to me that I'm embarrassed," he said according to the instructions Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how it looks?" It adds that "opening Superman's fear because it means you can't order me.
Try love."
His comments challenged the public's excitement at least twice, and members of the SNL's emission team were clearly defeated, passed by Variety, while one person who was present said, "This studio has been completely silent."
The West came as an exchange for Arian Grande, whose former partner, reper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
The West has caused a lot of confusion in the performance of the song and the hunts it is broken into Perrier's bottle.
Westa supported the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the most beautiful souls: thank you for not being involved in the abuse."
But the director of Karen Hunt's show claimed that West was simply "what he really is and that it's absolutely beautiful."
"But I choose not to reward someone (such as buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he has raised and expanded the ideology that damages my society.
He's free.
And we are," she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he will now "be previously known by the name of Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Didy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow reper Snoop Dogg called Snoop Lion, and of course a quiet music legend Prince has changed his name in symbol, and then in "the artist previously known as Prince".

It is expected that the defendant will appear at the Court for a violation in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be discussed by the Public Prosecutor.
The star of the "Games of Christmas" series, Kit Harington condemned the toxic cat culture
Kit Harington is known for his role in Jon Snow, who is a young cat in violent medieval fantasy, the HBO series of the game of history.
However, the player (31) broke down on the stereotype of the hero's sword, saying that such roles on the screen mean that children are very often considered to be cruel to be respected.
In a statement for Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of the toxic cat culture in #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married a partner from the game of Leslie Rose (31), admitted that he has "a strong need" to forget about this problem.
"I personally suffer pretty much at the moment - what have we done wrong with the representation of men?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of toxic cultural cataracts because of the appearance of characters representing men.
He continued, "What's born, and what's the thing of revenge?
What does this teach us on TV and on the streets why young people think they have to get involved in certain forms of male behavior?
I think it is, in fact, one of the main issues of our time – how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for young people.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the presentations or sets of the game series following its end of the summer, saying "he finished with war fields and horses".
Kit will be playing in the observation piece of Sam Shepard True West from November, talking about a movie producer and his brother, crying.
The actor recently discovered that he thought it was his wife, Rose, the best thing that happened in the game series.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she has given me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, a loving partner of Kitov's son Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won Amy's prize.
A couple married in June 2018 at the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% drop in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 880,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are transferred through sexual relations, which has been changed in relation to the previous state.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of blood transfusion contaminated with virus.
However, the number of people who get HIV this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, from year to year, the number of people living in China living with HIV and breast cancer increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a hot problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is very widespread.
Studies estimate that 70–90% of men having sexual relations with men at the end of marriage with women due to conservative understandings in the country.
The virus is frequently transmitted because of inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines within the framework of a plan to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters ignored the claim that one of her staff published data on Republican senators, condemned "problem lies" and "trust theories"
US Ambassador Maxine Waters ignored the claim that one of her staff has published personal data from three US Republican senators on the websites of these legislators.
A Democrat messenger from Los Angeles claims that these claims are placated by experts and websites of the ultrasonic wing.
"Talk, lie and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter release.
The published information has reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Commission on the allegations of sexual harassment against candidates for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
Before the information was published, there was a moment after three senators were investigating Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publication associated with the Waters office and published information about the member of her staff, told Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely incorrect and absolute lie," said Waters.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and false claims - is not in any way responsible for spreading this information.
This unfounded claim is completely incorrect and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly challenged the online court, which also issued an ex-secretary for the White House press, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial goes white," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests to the conclusion that she does not have a temperature that is necessary for members of Congress.
When someone accuses someone of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He can't be a dragon.
It must not be promulgated by the prosecutor's motives.
They must be peaceful and peaceful."
Fleischer clearly influenced the reaction of Waters with the criticisms of the democratic judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of acting too fiercely on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was asked to change Waters to the selections at the middle of the mandate, also announced through Twitter.
"Great thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement Waters said that her office warned "responsible institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We'll take care that the beginners discover," she continued, "and that before the law they are responsible for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all my staff members."
Review of Johnny English film again in action – a small Spanish family with Rowan Atkinson
It has already gone through the tradition of looking for the subtitles about Brexit in every new film with the British theme, which can also be applied to this French version of the Satirical Code of Action on Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the "Johnny English" and returned to the 2011 screen with the "Johnny English: born again".
Will ironic autosats about how we obviously do not benefit from being a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any event, the dumb, incapacitated Johnny English was given a new chance to overcome something – in which his name is more than all of it that the word of a universal chemical creation is thought to be for the territory with a film audience whose English is not mother tongue.
It is, of course, about a foolish secret agent who, despite the extreme tensions on top of the game, wears a little Clouseau, the Miss Bean's trumpet and the boy's ring that played only one note under the theme melody of the "Chariots of Fire" at the Olympic Games opening ceremony in London 2012.
He was also originally founded on a passenger and an international man entrusted with a big secret that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind him.
One or two of the most recent scenes are good.
I liked it when Johnny English arrived at the helicopter dressed in the middle of the middle of the lifeboat and when the rotor's knife suddenly hung on his cat.
Atkinson's talent for the physical comedy is obvious, but humor tends to be weak and in a very strange way too high, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and the impossible Mission automatically add chemical elements.
I think it's about children's humor, not for adults, and for me, Johnny's adventures are not as inventive and designed as Atkinson's gegos in the form of non-films like Mr. Bean.
Now it's a very current theme that Great Britain is in serious problems.
Hacker infiltrated the British supertina spy network, discovering the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the shame of an agent on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last cap in the complete glass of water for the prime minister, the pumping and trained guy who is already living a complete hell because of the fall of the political popularity: Emma Thomson has masterfully played this guy imagined by a sample on Theresa May, but he has staged quite a coincidence.
Her intelligence consultants are informed that all active spies are compromised and that they will have to employ one of the retired.
And that means Lieutenant Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some abandoned institution, but suddenly holds lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gegos when English holds a spying academy in the way of the "School Rock" film.
English quickly returns to Whitehall to emergency instruction and to regroup it with an old impatient partner Boughho, who plays Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a man, married to a submarine commander in whose energy and lead role Vicki Pepperdine is a little consumed.
So Batman and Robin are again serving the Secret Service of Her Majesty and happy to have a beautiful Fatigue wife, Opheli Bullet, who is fighting Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the corrupt Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their collection of comics: destroyed in the conobar, they burned the elegant French restaurant, the real chaos crossing into the Voltina luxury yacht, and English will start the right anarchy by trying to get to know the interior of the Voltine house using the audience for virtual reality.
It is obvious that great effort has been put into that last sequence, but it has as much sympathetic and happy, complete film as it has been designed for children.
It's pretty high quality.
Like other movies about Johnny English, I can't ask myself, can the British film industry imagine any role for Rowan Atkinson who would really show his talent?
The Laburist party refuses to make a plan for Britain to work for four days a week and to be paid for five days
Jeremiah Corbin's Laburist Party will consider a radical plan for which the British would work four days a week, but were paid for five.
The party claims that the head of the company will transfer to workers the time it saves thanks to the revolution of art intelligence (AI) by giving them another day of freedom.
The employees would enjoy it this way in the three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same payment.
Sources say that this idea would "enter" into the party's economic programme and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
A four-day shift has been approved by the Syndical Congress as a means by which workers can use the changing economy.
A high source from the Laburist Party said for Sunday Times: "The new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen during the night, but the four-day working week is a ambition that fits in the party's approach to economic rebalancing for workers, as well as in the party's industrial strategy at the same time."
The Laburist Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this ambition does not support the reading of the Laburist Party.
Portpol of the Laburist Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considered".
The opposition's Chancellor John McDonnell used the conference of the Laburist Party last week to express his views of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the "free director" and "profeter" in the community businesses.
The opposition officials' plans also mean that the current owners of the department in water supply companies may not return their total investment because the labs could impose "repetitions" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company committees and to create inclusive own funds that would allocate 10% of the company's value in the private sector to employees who are likely to collect annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about the 60-minute show on whether the FBI could change their opinion
The FBI investigated charges against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh made a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least seven days and raised the question whether the investigation office could instruct some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the "60-minute" issue writer Scott Pelley asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsaya Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would force them to change their opinion.
Kennedy thought he was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I think so, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before hearing I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugho.
I called him after this happened, after the charges were made, and I asked him, 'Did you do that?'
He was inconceivable, determined, unintended."
But Senator Graham's voice seems confused.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh was formed and there would be a serious charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has rejected it energetically," said Graham, talking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she calls it can't confirm it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of the City of the World, and did he do anything that would reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be the home of the World’s City Festival, an annual musical event with a truly impressive list of stars that will take place, as well as an impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World's Citizens' Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the large grasslands Central Park that will not only enjoy the events of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also reflect the light of the true goal of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World's Citizens' Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is the launch of a global project against poverty, an international group that is committed to eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight the same.
In order to receive an event free card (except if you are not willing to pay for the VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do some tasks or "work", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world's leader, telephone calls, and any other meaningful way to increase their message of purpose – ending poverty.
But how successful has the project of the World's Citizens with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to kill themselves to take something, or just one more view of so-called "clipticism" – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, citizens of the world's initiative have claimed that they have marked more than 19 million "actions" of their contributions that have been committed to a series of different objectives.
They say these actions are designed by world leaders to publish promises and political guidelines that are worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had made 390 promises and announced the proceeds from their actions, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power Shirann, the partnership of investors and executives from Great Britain who promised to "help children grow in their full potential," promises Ruandi will contribute $35 million to the end of the economy in that country, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the City of the World.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, as you are, we can make social injustice a historical fusnot," said Ambassador Pociy Shirane, Tracey Ullman, to the concerts living in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions called on Britain to improve the orphanage of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance the project of the Power of Ashran, which will provide intervention to 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their page, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The people of the world say: "It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall and become dust.
However, like all major steps for civil rights and anti-partheids before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will be presenting this year's event in New York, which will lead Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia into energy exports – Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington can "as much as necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, discovered Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of Internal Affairs, and passed the Washington Examiner.
The markets claim that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular, there are legitimate governments – is an excuse for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that it is the reason why they want to sell energy in the Middle East, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the Middle East," he said.
And according to the official's statement, there are ways and means to solve this issue.
"The United States has this opportunity to ensure, together with our Navy, that sea corridors remain open or, if necessary, block them so that they can ensure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
The markets were addressed to participants at an event where the organisation was the Energy Consumer Union, a non-profit group called itself " by the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He has done an interview with Washington's approach on relations with Russia and Iran, finding it to be the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less and more involved in the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying that Russia owns only one aut, and that its environment depends on fossil fuels.
Statements will come after the Trump's mission to increase exports of natural gas in Europe, replacing Russia with a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trumpa alone, are trying to kill Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which would have made Berlin a "concentration" in Moscow.
Moscow stressed in more detail that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars and that the existing gas pipeline capacity should be doubled to 110 billion cubic metres, except for a direct project.
The Kremlin argues that the reasons for the excessive opposition of Washington to this project are purely economic nature and that this is an example of illegal competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of executing pressure and that consumers should have the option of selecting suppliers," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with the American Energy Secretary for Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. State has triggered a German reaction that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the German Industry Union (BDI), invited the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when some third country is moving towards our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angele Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" about the presidential candidate for 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts.
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "give serious thought" to apply to the president after the next mid-year election.
During a meeting at the city hall in Hollywood City in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would think about the candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our corrupt government, which includes a woman on top," she said, and she transferred the source of The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider applying for presidential appointment."
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city council, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was called up for the criticism of the troops and his candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In his tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, the results of the polls published on Thursday showed that most of the electoral bodies that voted for Warren do not think she should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will probably vote in Massachusetts state said that Senators should not apply, according to a survey conducted by the Center for Political Research of the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed that there is greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidates, with 38 percent of voters supporting the potential candidate and 48 percent against the candidate.
The other voices from the democratic order that were discussed in terms of their potential candidates in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Beden said he'd make an official decision by January, as Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin spoke about PTSP Track Palina in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the re-rotation in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence after an incident that occurred on Monday night.
"What my son goes through, through what goes on after his return, can connect with what is happening to other families that suffer the consequences of PTSP and the vulnerability of our soldiers back," said the press at a support group of Donald Trumpu in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a hot topic" and, speaking of his son and other war veterans added "they return a little different, they return to the fortress, they return to question whether there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done, and all the other members of the army have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence - assault on a woman's person, arresting the registration of violence in the family and possession of weapons under the reality of the opiate, according to what Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police department of Wasilla, said.
18 countries, D.C. support the consolidation of new asylum policies
Eight countries and the Columbia District support the review of a new US policy that cuts asylum for victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the District filed a friendly report on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who oppose this policy, reported NBC News.
Many names of prosecutors in Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Union for Civil Liberties filed in August against the federal police, have not been found.
She said she was abused by her partner "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
He's in prison in Texas.
State attorneys who support Greece explained how El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States are coming, face a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States has rejected the 2014 Committee on Immigrant Claims, which has enabled immigrants who do not own documents, and has fled from violence in the family, to apply for asylum.
The state prosecutor of the Columbia District, General Karl Racine, said in a statement made on Friday that the new policy "determinates decades of state, union and international law."
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances and that the chamber violates this principle in this way," says a friendly report.
Lawyers continue to report that the police that fail to access immigrants are causing the US economy to suffer, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary labour force."
In June, State prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in matters related to migrants to no longer assign asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is only available to those who leave their mother country because of persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or social group or because of their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement of 11 June on politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all problems, even serious problems that people around the world face every day.
The desperate efforts to save the city of Palu while the number of dead is doubled in search of survivors
The situation for survival is all worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick little boy at the center of evacuation in the abandoned city of Palau.
"Every minute, emergency aid will bring the body.
The government condemns clean water."
The inhabitants return to their abandoned homes, overcrowded by the flood of things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals were devastated by earthquakes of 7.5 degrees.
Some of those injured like Dwi Haris who have broken the back and the shoulder, are located outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients are being helped outside because of the continued persecution.
His eyes filled with tears as he told of how he felt a strong earthquake that swept the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"It wasn't time to save ourselves.
I think the ruins of the wall have pressed me," Haris said to the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in the city because of the wedding.
“ I heard my wife crying for help and then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of carrying out "the violence of propaganda"
Seven days after the official Chinese newspapers published a statement on four pages in the U.S. newspapers, thanks to the considerable benefit of trade between the United States and China, US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump turned to China Daily's paid addition to China's newspaper in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after he accused China of joining the American Congress elections that would be held on 6 November, which China rejects.
The drumpo's claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in the American election indicates that American officials told Reuters, a new phase in the scaling campaign leading up to Washington to make a pressure on China.
And while it is common for governments to publish ads with a view to promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a scalaring trade war where some others increase import tariffs.
On the contrary, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war have been directed towards exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former former mayor of Iowa, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a comment published in the weekly edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, "now doubles that violence by publishing propaganda in our free press."
"Infamous by its propaganda, the government of China uses the valuable American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of press, placating the advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, on the kitchen that is here down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any real impact of the different opinions that people in China may have on the problem-oriented way of China, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under the strong influence of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not know what the newspapers were dealing with.
The Republicans reject women from voting in the eyes of mid-year elections with the Kavanaugh debak, warning analysts
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent Republicans who defend themselves and stand with a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, experience negative reactions, especially women, during the present mid-year elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense and most Republican people already show that they want to vote.
In these things there is no back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, in a magazine article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that what Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) would have asked the FBI's investigation to be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and state-level speaker of the progressive movementOn group, said in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators called for "new arrivals!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Committee decided to investigate with the candidate Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasts and motivations will be enormous," said news reporter Stu Rothenberg, a fearless political analyst.
"People say it's already high, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among unsolved female voters in the cities and among young voters between 18 and 29 years of age, who do not like the president, they do not vote."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which she filed a detailed complaint against the alleged sexual attack against a candidate for the Supreme Court trial, analysts were of the opinion that it could lead to negative reactions if the Republicans investigated the nomination.
"This has become a big deal for the Big Old Page," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, who was carrying the NBC News network earlier this week.
"It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way the Republicans have addressed this issue and how they have dealt with it," said the information channel Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Group of Priorities, who supports the democratic elections.
Yet, it seems that the Americans are quite divided in respect of who to believe after Ford and Kawanaugh's testimony, with which they are easily forced on the side of Kavanaugh.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the investigators believe in Ford's testimony definitively or probably, while 35% said they believe in Kavanaugh definitively or probably.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh thought he was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30% said that he thought the same thing about Fordov.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the instructions that have been issued by Ford and at least one other person who has filed a complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford, in front of the Senate Justice Committee last week, testified under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in drinking condition when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez reportedly claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court's trial showed his genitalia while attending the parties during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The Internet developer World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet that will override Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web network, runs a startup aimed at becoming a competitor Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform Solid, which is the Berners-Lee creator.
Solid enables users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee found that the intention of Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to do it right now," he said, talking about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store" or POD (personal online data store).
It can contain a list of contacts, a list of tasks, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique to a personal data store on the network is that it is entirely dependent on the user who can access any type of information.
The company calls it "a personal effort by means of data."
According to the company's principal director, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt provides sources, processes and appropriate skills so that Solid would be available to all.
The company is currently being made by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform of IBM, a number of employees of development engineers committed to working on the project and the volunteer programmer community.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models will be completely destroyed through the night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a statement on Saturday at the Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to secure commercial energy and ecosystems that will protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded World Wide Web concerts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the discussion of the neutrality of the network.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundations and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new web site," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victorian Christ of the First World War · Global Voices
The celebration in the honor of the only Anglican Church priest who is celebrated as a Victorian Christ as a warrior in World War I was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won recognition on September 29, 1918, for an attack by the cities of Bellengles and Lehacourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a gunman and never knew he had won the greatest British military recognition.
On a parade held on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a memorial panel.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that he was "unbelievably symbolic" because the monument was discovered 100 years after the doubt that his grandfather had received a reward.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "with a very nice sword and a strong rifle with a bow and a munitions ball."
He later rushed to the fire line and led the water forward before without any help to jump onto the field top and hit three out of the military line.
Colonel Vanna died a German soldier on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never get, but something that causes humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also put the widow after the parade that led by the deep orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels honored to participate in the paradise" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows support that many will give."
MMA fans who have been awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of getting Pepu Press
Imagine that, you've been awake all night to watch a set of Bellatra's 206 swords so that at the end you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and showed a live during the night on Channel 5 in Great Britain.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, right at the moment that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, viewers in Great Britain were blocked when the transfer was interrupted by Pepa Prase.
Many were not impressed that they stayed awake all night until early morning just because of the fight.
One blogger on Twitter described this obstacle to the transfer of short films as "some kind of disease jokes."
"It's about the government's requirement that this content is inappropriate at 6 o'clock in the morning, and they had to replace it with a programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of Bellatora for marketing and communication, on the subject of transfer.
"Pepa Ponce," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Cooker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from Great Britain in the future.
"I think when I'm talking about reprising, I think we can probably solve that," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there in the morning at 6:00 a.m. and we won't be able to realize anything until we arrive on Sunday, when it's already Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it came to the break, they surrounded the prescriptions and they were all enemies.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical curve.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government responsibility.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more of our fans, but we've gone too far.
That's one unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old said he was just in high school to realize that "not everyone like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, representing Lauren Laverne, he said he was open to talk about gay rights to give others "a hope."
He also said that what became a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular director of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was a few months away from the disease.
As a dropout in Laverne's first show, Daley said that while growing up, he felt "a little less valuable" than others because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, you feel less valuable and feel that I am different were the real things that gave me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove "someone," he said, so people don't get upset when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medals became a very important fight for the LGBT population and used his appearance at this year's Game of Commonwealth in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was speaking because he considered himself happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without any consequences and because he wanted to give others a “hope. ”
Trotsuki World Championship said his love for a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 "was surprised."
Daley married Oscar, a 20-year-old winner, and said that the difference in years was never a problem.
"When you live so much as you're so young" - the first time he appeared on the Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died three years later - he said it was hard to find someone who experienced similar success and fall.
A couple took place in the role of Robert Ray Black-Daley's parents in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was just about "I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than gold medals in the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 in the year 40 after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they still had cards for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in first order.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't be here to sit in first order, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn't safe," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympic Games in 2012 and won the bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to swim before the local public at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his choice of his first song - Proud from Heather Small - who responded to it while he was preparing for the Olympics and from which he is still being played by the Germans.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 after British summer time.
Mickelson of form at Ryder club
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he's gonna have to go back to the way this wouldn't be a novelist.
Mickelson, who plays on the record 12 times, Captain Jim Furyk sent to the club on Saturdays with four volts and four games.
Instead of being at the center of action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-year-old main winner spent the day in driving and improving the subject in the game, hoping to fix what's bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who was never the best player, even at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for demanding Le Golf Nationala, where a long unsound field regularly strikes down the strike.
And if I'm not afraid enough, Mickelson is in the ninth game on Sunday facing the British Open champion, Francescom Molinari, who won all four of their games this week with beginner Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, come to the hot start, Michaelson's game could be absolutely judged.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, supported me by the shoulder and buried me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He strongly believes in himself.
He's a member of the famous House, and he brought these teams back in the past and this week.
I'm sure I didn't mean to play two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it went, and we thought he had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will stop Nick Falda's record on Sunday for the number of games played by Ryder.
This could mark the end of his career at Ryder Park where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 stakes and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence brought a certain non-material value to the team.
"He's fun, sarcastic, he likes to dance with people and he's great to have such a guy in the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for young players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a puke game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of the single fight of Ryder can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane first appeared at a game played in Valderram city in 1997, when the captain of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended the competition with a sharp difference of 141⁄2-131/2.
"You remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrami, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," Bjorn said, thinking after watching the 2018 team, who won the score of 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So my stories and everyone in that team will show me this isn't over.
You're going to the end tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the table.
We have a goal, and that's what we're trying to win this trophie and that's where the focus remains.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's going on over and over on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Excited by the behavior of his players on a heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this take me.
It's a new day tomorrow.
Tomorrow's a single game, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there, you're testing yourself as a golfer.
It's a message you have to pass to the players - give most of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave a partner and he must also be the best of you."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in pairs, excluding Jordan Spietha and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Soryk and I were on both sides of these big movements of the last days, since it was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before it ended up as a loser after Europe had performed "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When he goes off with such an airplane, he creates a great pressure on the middle of the game.
We designed our position according to it and we prepared the boys so we're trying to perform some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the counterattack and to face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paulo Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I've gone with this group of guys in this position because I think she can cover everything up to the end," Bjorn said about choosing a single player.
New German warship again waiting
The new German Navy should be released in the spring of 2014 in order to replace the old warships from the Cold War, but will not reach for at least a year due to fraud on systems and external costs, local media have reported.
The release of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz," a leading ship in the class of completely new Baden-Wuertenberg frigate, was due until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoted by the military speaker.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems have threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Wuertertenberg class, which are ordered in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
As is known, there will be a strong top, low anti-aircraft and anti-brous rockets, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important persons include longer periods of maintenance - it should be possible for the latest frigates to be distributed for up to two years without returning to the mother’s womb.
However, the continuous delay means that the most modern warships, which were to enable Germany to distribute the forces out of its territory, will already be older when they start using it, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate arrived last year in the newspaper when German Navy officially refused to release the ship in use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss building in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after the shipment.
A little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have identified a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" for which the ship would, if it were to be deployed in some battle mission, be useless.
The software deficiencies were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuertertenberg class ships will manage the property from some 120 seafarers - exactly half of the number of people who managed the old Bremen class frigates.
It has also become evident that the ship is a significant burden that reduces its effect and limits the ability of the Navy to add future benefits.
It is believed that 7000 tonnes of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice heavier than ships of similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the unfair hardware, the price of a complete project, including staff training, also becomes problematic.
It is said that it reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to the original 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest frigates are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy "is leaving ships that can be distributed."
The officer said that this problem was growing in time because the old ships were registered and not received replacement ships.
He regretted that none of the students from the Baden-Wuertertenberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of the Swiss
A new study carried out on one property in the mountains of Scotland aims to find out how swirls use the landscape in search of food.
The results are expected to cast a new light on the behavior of single flying sisters and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scholars from the Scottish National Fund follows the usual skimish and type of soprano Pipistrelle, as well as a medium of long skimming and skiing of the Daubenton species in Vrtovima Inverwe Gardens in West Rossu.
A special recording device will be set at key locations around the property to track the activity of the mouse during the entire season.
Employees and volunteer NHS will also carry out mobile research using manual detectors.
The quick analysis of the video of all entries will determine the frequency of calls by the mouse and what they do.
A map of the stations and reports will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the local level.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant in the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important to the molluscs and how they are used by all kinds of people.
This data will help to determine the benefits of the work on the management of the stations, such as the creation of the libada, and which is the best way to maintain the forest for molluscs and other native species.
The population in Scotland and the UK has significantly decreased over the past century.
They are threatened by work on construction and development, which has a negative impact on the bed and the loss of the apartment.
Winds and lighting can also present a risk, including beautiful paper and chemical processing of building materials, and attacks on house pets.
The shishmists aren't really blind.
However, because of its habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when they catch the fish.
They use sophisticated eho-location technique to locate the bug and stop their flight by flight.
NTSC, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha countries throughout the country, is very seriously aware of the noise.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out checks, medical inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even established the first and only reserve for skiing in Scotland on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten types of skiing in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson says property is an ideal territory for them.
"We have a lot of areas here in Thrace," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old buildings and all the good buildings.
But there is still so much unknown about the moose, so what we're doing here and on other property will help us better understand what they need to make progress."
He points out how important it is to check whether they're smarter on property, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of a mother bed kills up to 400 women and young people, which will probably lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Chishmish are protected animals and the law prohibits their killing, torture, harassment or destruction of their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, the Squad Fund's staff, is the public to engage and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our muscles, and we simply do not know how the population of most of our species develops."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape while lawyers prepare a complaint against the German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo is a rape charge that has been described as "false news," saying people "will promote" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to charge German magazine Der Spiegel, who filed charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus was accused of rapeing an American named Kathryn Mayor at the hotel room in Las Vegas 2009.
Apparently, after that, he paid $375.000 to cover this incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Turning to its 142 million followers on the Instagram Live network, a few hours after reports of charges, Ronaldo, 33, criticised reports called them "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the winner of the Golden Fleet in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous talking about me, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," added the player laughing.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for these allegations, which have been called "unacceptable reporting of private doubts," according to the Reuters agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for “unmaterial damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The incident occurred in June 2009 in the apartment of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the playing room, where he reportedly raped her, according to the documents provided by the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Major says Ronaldo clung on his knees after the above incident and told her that he was a "99% good guy" who ignored those "1%."
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sex, but that he was willing.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she was photographing her injuries in the hospital, but that later she agreed to a foreign deal because she felt "dangerous" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old girl says she's looking for a contract cancellation now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to the Royal Madrid from Manchester, United States at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he went to the Italian Juve dive for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will always regret losing the car manufacturer
The UK will "always complain" if it loses the status of world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that what Toyota the UK said about BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border damage on Bexit could cause loss of jobs without agreement.
A factory in Burnstone producing Toyotin Auris and Avenues developed nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March we will see the stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyote in Burnaston.
Other UK producers including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover expressed fear about how cross-border trade would work if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he's gonna close his mini factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main fears relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the acquisition chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyote production line works on the principle of "time-only" where parts arrive every 37 minutes from the UK and EU supplier for vehicles made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may come to an end on the border which can lead to the decline and loss of shares by industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stocks longer than one day in his factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan, which offers Theresa May for future EU relations, "is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We must have an agreement. We want to achieve the best agreement that will allow me to say, not only to enjoy the present success but also to seize this opportunity," said Radiation 4 on BBC in the current programme.
"The example is not only Toyote but also that other producers must be absolutely able to continue what was extremely successful under the supply chain."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that long-term additional costs would be considered to reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and ultimately reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnston for 24 years, and the union union of the Union in the factory, said that his members were more concerned: “From my experience, when such a place of work is in prison, they never come back again.
The Speaker of the Government said: "We must eliminate a precise and credible plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be remedied, they say from the White House.
A very important meeting of Donald Trumpa with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be "responsible for another week" because there is an ongoing debate on candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, they said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the election, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential opposition to justice by the president.
Whether Trump will release the deputy of the Attorney-General or not, and thereby endanger Mr. Mueller's independence, it's been months of the discussion in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was also talking about the challenge of recording talks with Trump and the possibility of a change of presidential position on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these voices.
But last Monday he was in the White House, in the middle of a vote about leaving.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" to leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was arranged to avoid a violation with the hearing of the Senate Legal Commission on which Kavanaugh was testified and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, the feds ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation against Kavanaugh for a week, which further delayed the vote of the Senate in the plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this is not yet determined, it could be this week, and it could happen for another week in view of all the other things that are happening in connection with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I love that the press will always be informed."
Some journalists would deny this claim: Sanders has not kept a brief press address for journalists in the White House since September 10.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the smaller number of short-term calls were not due to the threat of "theatrical behaviour" on the TV journalist, although she said, "I'll agree with the fact that they're convinced."
Then she said she would strengthen direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without giving evidence, "we have seen these numbers."
The short transition will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States, that is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more and you've seen us do it for the last few weeks, and you're going to talk to the president of the United States to replace the press with a little bit more."
The trumpet regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or in press conferences when visiting an official.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the collected journalists, was unconstitutional and sometimes strange.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the EU withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to remedy the costs of the EU citizens’ status requirements in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued over the summer, and decisions are expected for this summer.
But the government also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this was a very bad time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate the value of the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and wider, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and advance the work of health services, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjugated emergency surgery after head injury
The defense team player State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in a Saturday break at 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Major coach Tennesse State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury happened a little before the half hour.
"He came to the field line and just dropped down there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edges of the territory before they put it on their noses and carried it on further examination.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had finished surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details about the type/both of injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to detect when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a student of the second year in the red dress, plays the first season for Tennessee State after a walk from Illinois.
He had five total fights on Saturday before he left the game, which brought him 18 total fights in the season.
Foreign buyers will be paid a larger tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK
Purchases from foreign countries will be charged more tax on the occasion of the purchase of real estate in the UK, using additional resources to assist non-residents in accordance with the new conservation plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
More taxes will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The treasurer expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay more taxes on the purchase of real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, theresa May will be published today.
This step will be considered by attempting to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn, trying to attract young voters to promises that they will ensure more accessible state-of-the-art attention and focus on those who earn more.
More tax will be paid to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money strengthening the Government's intention to fight against open-ended sleep.
An additional grant, which is outside the existing law, including more levels, introduced two years ago on the second real estate and the purchase of rent, could amount to up to 3%.
The treasurer expects this move to increase income to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built estates in London buy people who do not have a residence in the UK, so the price increases, and purchasers who buy real estate for the first time become more difficult to become owners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “the cities of spirits” because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduced rate to help a larger number of young people get to their first home.
He accused the construction firm of maintaining high prices of real estate by buying the first chance of a land that they do not use, and asked Mrs. May to leave the quota for accessible houses before it could end the British "study of state policy."
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of reform proposals, including the control of renting and dissipation of any proposed shares.
He also wants to give more authority to build new houses.
“ Last year, ” said Mrs. May, “I said that I would entrust my prime minister’s mandate to return the British dream - that the lives of every new generation should be better.
And that's what it means to fix our bad stem market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it cannot be true that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as other companies, can easily buy houses as well as valuable British.
The dream of ownership over the house has become too far for many people, and non-human sleep is still real."
Jack Ross: "My final ambition is to lead Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" to be a Scottish representative manager at some point.
The fourteenth-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a Northeast club, currently located in the third place in the First League, with three points less than water.
This summer he moved to the stadium light after the last season returned St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League.
"I wanted to move on to my country as a player.
I was in the B-time and that was it," Ross said for the Sports Sound BBC Scotland show.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always pushed me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be offered if I were successful in leading the club."
The Russian presidents as managers of Sanderland include Dicka Advocata, Davida Moyes, Sama Allardycea, Martina O'Neilla, Roya Keanea, Gusa Poyeta and Paulo Di Canioa.
The former head of Alla Athletic Club says he didn't feel upset because he came after such great names in such a big club, after he rejected the offer of the Barnsley and Ipswich Town Club.
"The measure of my success at this moment will be 'will I succeed to return this club to the Prime Minister's league?
Judging on the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly falls into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get him there, but I think I'll be able to think of success only if I can get back to the club where his place is."
Ross was only in the third year of his managerial career, after a period he spent as assistant chief in Dambarton and 15 months as part of Harts' training staff.
Then he helped Alla recover from the fall into the third category, and St. Miren withdrew from his escape from the lower league to the winner of the Championate next season.
And Ross says he feels better now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepol, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real birthday," Alla recalled taking over the club.
"I sincerely believed that management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
Sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I made a decent fortune, and I enjoyed some solid success.
But playing can be hard.
It's so much you have to spend every week.
I'm still going through it in the sense of stress and pressure from the job, but the management just answers me.
I've always wanted to be involved in management and now I'm doing it, and in my entire adult life, I didn't feel much better than now."
You can listen to the entire interview at the Sportsound show on Sunday, 30 September on the Scottish Radio from 12 noon to 1 p.m. after the British summer time
The perfect time for the cup is Saturday at 17:30, discovers research
The summer's heat wave increased the traffic of British popes fighting for survival, but it increased pressure on the side of the restaurant.
In the papacy and baroque groups, sales growth from 2.7% in July, but sales in restaurants fell by 4.8%, as figures show.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consultancy company, who collected data, said: “The long - term and long - awaited English participation in the world’s primacy led to a similar pattern in July as in the previous month of June, when the popes achieved a 2.8% growth, and the restaurants had even more decline.
The drop in traffic in restaurants from 1.8% in June has only increased in July.
The popes and barons focused on the drinking achieved the far better result with increased growth compared to the results from the previous period than the drop in traffic in restaurants.
The popes focused on food also lost due to the sun, but not as dramatic as the owners of the restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In papayas and baroques, there is an increase in the sales of alcohol by 6.6% per month, with the drop of food by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the Agency for the Analysis of Entertainment and well-being of RSM, said: “These results continue to bear witness from the end of April.
Timely opportunities and the impact of major social and sports events are still the main factors when it comes to selling abroad.
It does not surprise the fact that groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the fall from 4.8% will be particularly painful at the annual level with already present price pressures.
Long summer couldn't come in the worse time for customers focused on food, and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a bit of relief."
The total growth of sales in papayas and restaurants, including newly created objects, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow introduction of new brands.

Every five children have a secret mission on social networks that hides from their parents
Every five-year-old, of which some grow up only 11 years old, has a secret mission on social networks that conceals from their parents and teachers, discovers research
A survey involving over 20,000 students of the upper secondary school revealed an increase in the number of “false Instas” page
This news has increased the fear of advertising sexual content
Twenty percent of girls said they had a "primary" command that shows parents.
Every five children, of whom only 11 years of age are responsible for social networks that are hidden from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students revealed an urgent increase in the "false Insta" commission, which relates to the page to share the photos of Instagram.
These reports have strengthened the fear of the advertising of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the girls said they have a clear "primary" job that shows parents, but they also have private tasks.
One mother who found her 13-year-old daughter on the secret page discovered a teenage girl who called another one by the words, "Let me go."
A survey conducted by the Digital Society of the UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40% of the children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, while half admitted that they had private tasks.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: The disturbing fact that so many teenagers are coming to try to create a space on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in the Scottish athletic team
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Committee of Athletics as an imperfect director at the annual meeting of that administrative body.
Doyle was the most prized Scottish athlete, and president Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from her rich experience gained at international level over the past decade.
"Elidy enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice and I hope I can really bring sports to Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including victory in the race at 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 game in Atlanta, and now a regular expert on BBC, has remained unbelievably behind a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time can show me how much I'm going to fix.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk, and today I'm practicing as an agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
Advertisement for a publisher in which mother-in-law has shared an opinion on the Internet
A company that produces publishers shared an opinion on the Internet with a advertising that wants to compare with the cows of the musars.
In order to mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent publisher", Elvie’s consumer technology company published an inspired entertainment video showing the freedom that the new pump provides for milk-producing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a chair between the shadows and the cows with a song that says, "Yes, I'm married but I don't have a rap" and, "If you haven't noticed, but that's not a dream, these are my breasts."
The following phrase is quoted: “Pup, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, I must myself.”
However, ads published on the company’s Facebook page have raised competitions on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video has generated a variety of viewers' reactions, while many have said that it sheds light on the "wheats" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they must be pregnant and born like us to produce milk, but their babies are taken a few days after birth," one wrote.
Elvie is discrepancies in the breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother) pump
Another commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, yes, why don't you use the publisher's advertising for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "The claim has no meaning."
The others stood in the defense of the sermon, and one woman admitted that the song was “screaming. ”
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy this if I still wanted to.
Because of the betrayal, I felt like a cow.
It's a little bit of a joke, but I got it right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a ridiculous advertising directed at mothers who issue milk (often at work or at a toilet) and feel like a “crowd”.
This isn't advertising that praises or makes milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their chests.
The concept of advertising is based on the fact that many mothers who issue milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely unheard of, there's no wires or pipes, and it's standing in a dormitory, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while they deliver milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother’s company, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves courage and provocative launch.
By withdrawing the parallel between rain and cows, we wanted to focus on milk delivery and all the challenges that go with it, showing in a fun and understandable way an incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's pump got into news headlines.
During the Seventies fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the bridge in the creation of Marte Jacubowski using this product.
Hundreds of children migrant secretly moved into a tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants increased although the number of monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the other rhetoric and policies introduced by the Tromp's administration made it difficult to find an elderly person for children.
Traditionally, most of the parents and themselves were migrants without documents who fear to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by going out to adopt the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential elders and other adult members of their households would have to be given fingerprints and that the information would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer from the Immigration and Customs Service, announced last week before Congress that this service had been arrested by ten people who had been reported for ageing over minors without a trace.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the arrested were not convicted in the past.
"About 80% of the persons who are or are elders or members of the household of an elderly person are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed criminal acts.
That's why we're gonna keep looking for those people, said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to make children faster through the procedure, officials introduced new rules to which some of them would have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, the workers in the reception room said.
Many will respond to a video call instead of personally, so that the immigration judge would ask for their status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported soon.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to the outbreak of anger or the attempt to escape, the more likely the workers of the reception and reports that have arrived from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say such risks are increased in larger institutions such as those in the town of Tornillo, where it is much easier to detect signs indicating that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to the camp without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to have a good time with friends can lead to the trauma that many children have already experienced.
Syria is looking for an urgent withdrawal of American, French and Turkish "computer forces"
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also invited Syrian refugees to return, although the war in that country has lasted for eight years.
Moulalem, who is also responsible for the role of the Prime Minister's replacement, said that the parties were illegal in the Syrian country, stating the fight against terrorism and "that they will be accounted for in a proper way."
They have to be put down and unhindered," he said at the seat.
Moulalem stressed that in Syria “the war against terrorism is almost over”, where over 330,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "the Holy War until we crush all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every side presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily responsible for training and advice of Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country by war.
In the case of refugees, Mouale said there were good conditions for their return and discovered "a single Western country" to "screaming Iraqi fears" that forced refugees not to return.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable this return," he said.
"They policy what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not be helpful to restore Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of the Tampon-zone in the last major rebellion in Idlibu created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has rejected a major attack on the Syrian forces supporting Russia in a province where three million people live.
Moulalem pointed out, however, that the agreement had "open arms" and expressed his hope that war action would be launched against the Jahadists and barons from the Nusra front associated with Al Kaid, who would "be executed."
Ambassador of the UN Staffan de Mistura hopes to gather soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the authorities and opposition members in order to draw up a draft post law for Syria and prepare a path to the elections.
Moulalem outlined the terms of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee's work, saying that the work of this body should be limited to "considering the members of the present constitution" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be selected for another mandate
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected at the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, opposition and scandal will not break his mandate earlier.
This would undoubtedly represent "the most dramatic end of the presidential mandate all the time!"
For now, there's no sign of the viewer's smell.
Since 2014, retiring in an attack term has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN channel and almost destroyed to 1.6 million on MSNBC channel.
According to the Nielsen agency, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in an attack term, unlike four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC has been retreading cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the night with hit news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer producer drama "The chosen survivors" on the ABC channel, about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scowell, a longtime comedian writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few raw truths about putting in Hollywood Boys' Club," has a different theory.
She remembers driving in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, 'cause he's laughing at me,' said Mrs. Scowell to me.
Haos has a fun value too.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can decide the future of the Roe Abduction Act against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what the global situation will be.
Exclude is a luxury that can only allow the most privileged viewers.
However, you went a little further from the general information when you realized that you had been watching the panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "long background" for his book "Strah," about which Paul Manafort of the new skin worth $15,000 (“dry with a fat nature of bashington Post”, wrote Washington Post) and the implications of the description, this, the anatomics, Mr. Trumpa, who gives Stormy Daniels.
Yeah, for example, I'm never gonna look at Super Mary with the same eyes anymore.
"A part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that you have something to eat every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creation of the "Zalagaonica", commenting on rotation of the playwrights and every day's bubbles of Trumpo's show (critical American football league, complimenting Kim Jong-una).
You can't allow yourself to miss one episode, or you're in the balance.
When I arrived this week to Mr. Fleissa, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kuaija was sunned at about 80 degrees (27 °C), but he closed inside and watched MSNBC and simultaneously filmed CNN.
He could not be separated from the screen, not until Brett Kavanaugh was ready to face the Senate Legal Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy broadcasts in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was some joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large amounts of money from the side in the most uncertain medium-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th round of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the sharing of the convention districts that resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent crossing of the border in Pittsburg Premier took place on the election of democratic representative Conora Lamba, who came to the top of the second round after foreign elections last spring.
Lamb fights against another current representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely offset by the new 17th round.
The cards were re-examined after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally formed for the benefit of the Republicans.
The impact of the new 17th round launched a campaign to finance the campaign between the main foreign financial collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after his victory in a wide-ranging special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This position has been held by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the round with the preference of 20 points.
Political analysts have given an unknown preference to democracies.
The United States considers El Salvador's punishment for support from China, but then withdraws
The diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little support from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartbreaking meeting with the president of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners had released the Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "new decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, said in a statement beginning the month.
But the penalties are considered only for El Salvador, which was estimated to have received 140 million US dollars in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial aid and targeted restrictions, would be difficult to tackle this Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, which was to be continued by a similar last year's group, which presented a step forward in efforts to prevent the arrival of migrants in the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that, in fact, they had ceased any consideration of the El Salvador sanctions.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which represents a sign of the importance of the administration of the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys have secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sentences from Washington.
Speaker White House in the name of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussions described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the condition that they remain anonymous.
Their findings confirmed an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
Next thing you can prepare could be the report by special researcher Robert Mueller on the possible execution of Trump's court, which now provides significant evidence in public records.
According to the reports, Mr. Mueller also focused his research on finding a possible link between the Trump campaign and Russia's attacks on the elections.
If the majority change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is prepared to stand again before the election, and perhaps before the jury.
It's a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall, not even those in Europe who are like him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to launch a state attack on Hitler, only that the West opposed and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We didn't succeed and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of their succession.
This is how history turns around such extreme points, and the impossible march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing more of such extremes.
What will we do if Mr. Trump leaves the deputy of the chief prosecutor, Roda Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an undisclosed position since this letter announced last year that he has presented the president's secret recording and has expressed his suspicion that he is not equal to the performance of the function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the statement from Tims is incorrect.
"How will we react if a recent FBI investigation about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidate for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-year elections for Congress, which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we're not going to fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auszvic by the same Nazi regime that had ever taken over the country in which I was a ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath on that table with a cup of cactus.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Beča
The Rangers are on Thursday at the home of Rapid from Becha, knowing that they will win against the Austrians, after an impressive campaign in Spain against Villarrela in the beginning of this month, put themselves in a good position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
The damage of the knee prevented the binding player Graham Dorrass to deduce this season until the unsolved sword with Villarel's final result 2-2, but it is believed that Rangers can use this result as a dropboard for further use.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing that we could get something and we went with the ponies.
Maybe we could finally take them, but everything, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we returned to the second half, and we were better.
On Thursday, he's expecting us again for a lot of European evenings.
We hope we can take three points, but it will be a hard fight because they've had good results in the past, though, with the support of the public we can certainly win and achieve a positive outcome.
Last year was no doubt difficult, starting from everything that happened to my injuries, and to change into a single club, but now we're content with what we have right now.
The team is in good shape and the boys really enjoy it; we train well.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of the pension savings
Despite the fact that the investigators had a clear idea of how to care for them, they had little discussion with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the research of the Nationwide company said they were talking to their spouses about the long-term costs of it.
Only 10% of them said she talked to her children about it.
"People want someone in the family to talk about them, but they don't want to start talking about it," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the life insurance sector in the nationwide company.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your wife and children: You can’t prepare your family to give it to you unless you first express your wishes.
Work with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to be given to him, as such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you figure out how to pay those costs.
Your selection of long-term funding may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value that would help you cover these costs or self-sustainment – provided you have enough money.
Collect your legal documents: prevent legal battles in progress.
Make a decision on medical help to have an authorised person who will monitor the medical care provided and ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you are not able to communicate.
Consider, too, the conclusion of a multi-stakeholder financial agreement.
This means choosing a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you are weak.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs medical help and is taking him to the hospital.

A man shot with more airguns in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with more shots from the airgun while the dogs came home from the night out.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
The police described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 at the British summer, as “unsanitary action”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called the witnesses to answer.
Landmarks and condoms in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by powerful earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials announced, and it is expected that the number of dead will grow.
As a result of the interruption of the link, aid officers were unable to obtain any information from Dondre's territory, the northern area of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of the 7.5 degree power stream.
After the disaster in Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donghi, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palau is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when he was hit by torture and shame.
Donghea is a circle that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) west of the island of Sulawesi.
The area, which is administratively lower than the area, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are based on the region of Central Sulawesi, and particularly the coastal region of Donghe.
The mines are also important in the landscape, but they are mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palo and Dondrea have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938 he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donghi.
The tsunami struck West Donghan in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located in the Seismic Pacific fire zone and is regularly discussed on the ground.
These are some of the main attacks and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The great earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Acehu.
2005: A series of strong attacks hit the west coast of Sumatra by the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6.8 steps struck south Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, triggering tsunamis that invaded the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of 7.6 steps struck the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 steps struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 feet [10 m] that destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016.: Pidie Jaya hit the region in Acehu, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the death penalty and tsunamis of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the building.
2018.: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 lives lost, mainly on the northern side of the island.
Potres destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sare Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Aljas and candidate for the Vice-President, Sare Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the basis of the suspicion that he had committed domestic violence, stopped the reporting of violence in the family and stopped the arrest, says a report published on Saturday by the state police agency of Aljasca.
According to the police report, when the informant tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her off the phone.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su prison unit, and he was sentenced to 500 dollars' prison sentences, he informed KTU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he explained on the issue of the explanation of the crime that "it is certainly not a crime," this network reported.
Palin is faced with three Class A offences, which means he's sentenced to a fine of $250,000 a year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with violating Class B, which is sentenced to a prison sentence for one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal reports have been filed against Palina.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the vet court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of violence in the family, forced to register violence in the family, and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
Saru Palin criticized the veterinary group in 2016 after it brought about violent behaviour of his son with PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Food and Agriculture in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees that caused tsunamis destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been an interruption of the link and supply of electricity, and it is expected that the number of dead will increase in the next days.
The epicenter of the country was directly with the central part of Sulawesi, northeastern of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarte.
On social networks, videotapes are surrounded by video clips showing the moment of attack.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death sentence for Sayfulla Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York where eight persons were killed - a rare punishment that has not been carried out for federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a hired truck company Home Depot to carry out a bicycle race along the West Side road in Donja Manhattan, where he was hired by passengers and bicycles who were on his way to October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "naturally" killed eight victims and "naturally" brought serious physical injuries, mentioned in the request for the death penalty, which was imposed in the south of New York.
After both of these points, the execution of the death penalty is possible, provided in a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal prosecutor accused Saipov of 22 counts involving eight charges of murder and rectification, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and the charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "a significant planning and thought," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saip had done it as “stupid, cruel and corrupt”.
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to Diego Enriquea Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchia, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucca," says the application for prosecution.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been decades since the South District of New York last had a case that threatened the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were murdered after being sentenced to believe in spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953 at an electric chair.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show a complaint in the days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police reported it.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video recording on his phone, he was inspired to execute the attack, mentioned in the charge.
He also asked for an ISIS stop in his hospital room, and the police reported it.
He made it clear that he was not guilty of 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting a life imprisonment without the possibility of release for confession of crimes, will only prolong the course of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense has previously asked the prosecutor not to make a death sentence.
The conservative messenger says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for talks about Brexit
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the national army" today during a protest at a Conservative Conference.
The former Independent Party leader of the UK said that politicians had to "feel discontent" in Eurosceptics, as one of the Ambassador Therese May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bonne said at the briefing in Birmingham that the UK would "go" so far that Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in attempting to bring together its deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives who claimed the rest of the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his compromise plan from Chequers in spite of attacks and attacks and supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that it continued with attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and urged Eurosceptics and labs to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bonne said on his way to go to Solihul that he wants to "reject the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have a title and be responsible for talks with Brussels.
"If he were the head, we'd have gone out already," he said.
The Ambassador from Wellingborough added: "I'll fight for Brexit, but we have to shoot Chequers."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be defeated.
We want to bring our laws into our country."
Mr. Bonne rejected the suggestion that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and that they want to stay completely wrong."
“ I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our side, and among our activists who were actually those who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please withdraw the plan from the Chequers and start listening."
In a strong message, Mrs. May added: “The prime ministers are able to keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farage told the audience that politicians must be forced to "feel discontent" if they are willing to ignore the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "That won't pass."
In a letter to the excited audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit’s publishing, to feel discontent.
"We mobilize this country's national army that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become independent, self-government, proud, United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the remnants have marched through Birmingham before they have held a two-way assembly in the city center.
A number of activists have failed the transparency of "Torieves against Brexit" following the formation of this weekend's group.
Laburist Lord Adonis complained to the conservatives about the security problems they had with the application of the parties to open the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the "Canad plus" plan for an unlimited state on the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete phrase.
Good Brexit can't," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about the president's candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will seriously think about the president's candidate after November's elections.
Boston Globe reports that a resident from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a participating meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.

She's at the center of speculation to be able to deal with Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electors on which the participatory format of the meeting has been used since Trump took office.
One of the guests asked if she was planning to apply for a president.
Warren turned down the time for women to go to Washington to correct our corrupt government, and that includes a woman on her head."

Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after his successor guarantees victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the team's successor will play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettle to attack his team.
The winner first went to the box and left Hamilton behind to get involved in the traffic at first, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and went out behind the Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action a point from the point that Ferrari's driver had difficulty leaving the free interior at risk of staying after a double move in defense of the third race.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of solutions and was seven at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race by relying on his rubber to get to the quick end and crossed Kimy Raikconen's fourth place.
He finally arrived in box on 44th round, but he couldn't speed up the pace of the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri was working a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
Tim did a really extraordinary job to achieve a one-to-two formation finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad speech of the body.
President Donald Trump named Senator Diane Feinsten on the motion on Saturday because she insisted that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which the Supreme Court candidate Britta Kavanaugh accuses of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly take the witness of the Forum before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are wicked, dangerous and deceptive.
The only thing that could have happened was the wonderful thing that happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, angry, angry, angry and pathetic and lying, he said.
When you look at the ads and the information they ran into the public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you let information in the public?
You remember her answer... did you leave a document in public--what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leave it to the public."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein in July a letter with details of Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it went through early September - although Feinsten claimed that the information had been processed from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't leave her story in public." said Feinstein's committee, Hill's report.
She asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret, as she asked."
But her complaint did not come to the president's approval, who at the meeting on Saturday night commented: "To tell you, it was really a bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen the worst speech in my life."
In keeping with his defence candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual abuse, the president urged that these instructions be used for their own purposes.
They are determined to return power at every price.
You see the violence, misery, they don't care who will hurt, who must be ignored to come to power and control," the media transmit the words of the president.

We've prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalinantan to move him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
Our hearts are ashamed of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims could be reached by thousands, while the state agency for disaster mitigation indicates that access to the cities of Donghe, Sigi and Boutong is limited.

A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports that after a plane crash in the valley, one face goes missing.
The airline whose plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia reports that one face is running like a missing, after it has previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members are safely evacuated from the plane that hit it.
Air Niugini, in the release, states that from Saturday afternoon they are not able to enter the passenger's track.
The airline indicates how they work in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the instructions for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water in an attempt to land on the Chuuk island.
The officials announced on Friday that seven faces had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that on Saturday six more passengers were detained in the hospital and that they were all in a stable state.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact outcome of the event.
And the airline and the U.S. Navy have announced that the plane is over in the valley doesn't reach the bridge.
Some fathers think the plane has crossed the bridge.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said how he and the others managed to escape to the exit of the danger case through the water that led them to the train in the plane that hit them.
He said the property was in the panic and was crying, and that he was suffering from headaches.

An American Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed hours ago as an expert in the field of reporting data analysis.
Before he was born, he used the cell phone data to create a picture of the move of the accused Quinton Tellis, aged 29, and the victims of Jesse Chambers, aged 19, on the night that her death occurred.
Rowlett said he got the location data from several phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was with his own friend Michael Sanford, the police went to examine Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanfrod said he lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis confirmed that Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone data showed that they only met for one week.
Rowlett said Tellis was a certain time after Chambersine's death from his phone deleted her messages, calls and contact information.
He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The team should start on Sunday with the concluding words.
The judge said he expected the trial before marriage to be followed later in the course of the day.

Another black person?!
The New York Times filed a couple of charges for rejection after a racist text message.
New York's nanny complains a couple to give up on the basis of discrimination after she got the wrong text from the mother in which she complained she was another black person."
Some deny that they are racist, estimating the complaint as an excuse."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was dissatisfied when after her arrival on the first working day of 2016 she realized that she was the new owner of the children, Giselle Maurice, black.
It's not another CRNKINY," said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gauze, Plasco-Flaxman abandoned Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their ex-girlfriend, who was an African, had done his job badly and that instead she was expecting the Philippines, transferred to New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a donation for one day's work and the murder of a sent home.
Maurice now complains about a couple of requests for release, as well as an amount of $350 per day for six months, to how much she was originally committed to living with her family, even without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she said on Friday for Post, adding that it's discrimination."
A couple of charges for racism revealed that the rejection of Maurice's engagement was reasonable because they feared that after they had offended her they would not be able to believe it.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," he said for Post's husband, Joel Plasco.
Would you trust your children to someone you have hurt, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Approves a complaint as an offer," Plasco said that his wife had only two months of family leave and that she was in a very difficult situation."
You're going to shoot someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial was still ongoing, the public court was quick to condemn money on social networks, criticising them for such behavior and thinking.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not agree with the witness who speaks, a new letter would be discovered.
The Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter: It's hard to put into someone who reads it the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
She says that her father, who was, before a little confused nurse inspired him to write a book for the children, worked for BBC as a cameraman, although he was positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the release of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
She added that her father was proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was the man, he didn't like to praise," she said.
But since Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if your child did something and you were proud of him, although it wasn't really your reward.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination, he has always recorded all the benefits alone in Paddington."
My daughter died, and we had to apologize over the phone.
Her daughter was quickly transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 in Nica, where doctors struggled to save her life.
Nad regularly called to say it was bad, and they didn't expect it to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
Then Nad called me to say she's gonna die in the next two minutes and I have to forgive her.
I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey."
I'll be with you soon, too.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her so that her heart would continue that the pump of blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her blood.
She died a few minutes before that, and everything went off.
I could just sit and wait, knowing what's next.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be saved."
At the end of Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now in mourning for the death of her daughter, was in the plane with the rest of the passengers, who had never dreamed of what the roof she passed.
No one knew," she said.
I've lifted my head, and my tears have flown without stopping my face.
It's hard to explain, but over the years, I've been overwhelmed by feelings of hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Injured women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have committed suicide want to prevent others from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreyes are placing cards with motivated messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, son of Miss Davis, was 13 when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospector with a smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would mark every room."
However, before his death he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after this 2014 suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried that it's going to leave the consequences."
Mrs. Davis thought of these cards so people would know there's someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, so at least it was just a friend.
Do not sit and stand – speak.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he's unsatisfied, depressed or anything else," she says.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his appearance.
On Christmas he was on his own day - when the children opened their gifts, he did not look at them in the eyes or anything else."
She says that his death was a tremendous tragedy for them, but that they had to overcome it: it leaves a huge family holiday.
It's gonna blow us up.
But we will continue to fight."

By opening up the FBI investigation, the future of Bretta Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he asked -- a limited investigation of the length and scope -- maybe it would even unite us," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding how the committee was afraid to split up" because of unmistakably foreign positions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican colleagues not want the FBI investigation?
Their plight is caused by the choice of the moment.
Elections for Congress are held for every five weeks, November 6, and if the Republicans are going to go through the worst, as expected, their efforts will be made to select their man in the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
On Saturday, George W. Bush telephoned the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him he also met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's gonna happen after the FBI makes his report?
There will be a vote in Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavnough could get at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Penceu to decide by his vote and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of escapes from North Korea falls under Kim.
The number of escapes from North Korea in South Korea declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Calling for data from the Ministry of the Union of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug suggests that the last year, 1127 ran out in conjunction with 2011 when that number was 2706.
Mr. Park said two decisive factors are the stronger control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates that kidnappers pay.
Pyongyang didn't publicize.
The vast majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered to South Korea.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China's escape considers illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which have been technically still in the war - have been corrected in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss the halted negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historic meeting between US President Donald Trumpa and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, on which a broad consensus was reached to work on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong blamed the US sanctions for the current lack of progress.
Without confidence in the US there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it does not take us to be the first to be confused," RI said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Kavanaugh a hysterical," she says she's not like serving in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Presbyterian House of Nancy Pelosi called a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh as Hissterical" and said that he was inconsistency for service in the Supreme Court because of his temperature.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't but don't think that a woman would ever act like that would be called hysterical," Pelosi said for her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotionally ignoring the suggestion that he was sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial exhibition, Kavanaugh was very emotional, temporarily almost crying and crying when he was talking about his family and his high school years,
He also strongly condemned the democratics in the committee, estimating the allegations against him by a large-scale and orchestrated attack on his personality" which they organised to anger that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform a function in the Supreme Court because it showed his fear of the damage of democracy.
I think he is disqualified by such statements and the way he went against Clinton and democracy," she said.
The question is whether they will try to call Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the democracies get most of the House of Representatives, Pelosi is exhausted.
I'll say the next -- if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not like he's not just in the Supreme Court, but not in the court he's on," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the District Court of the District Columbia District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about any Kavanaughi's ruling against the Act on Accessory Health Protection or in the case of Roe v Wade, considering it to be a conservative judge.
In hearing of his confirmation, Kavanaugh refused to answer questions about whether he would exceed certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It's not time for a hysterical, fearful person to stand in court and expect us to say it's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
A sincere heart, a anger that has been collected for months and years, and it cannot be resolved without payment.
We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: She helped me a lot with a woman who was a executive director somewhere, and who said how she cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that, when she was angry and started to cry, someone who would say you might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then I'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
Suspension is permitted to emit heat partly and because they are, in principle, misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories of my former job, in the office where most men were, is how I was, when I once cried because of an unreceptive heat, an old woman - a cold boss I was always a little scared - grabbed by the door and pulled out on the stairs.
I never let them see how I cry," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they're going to be happy because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressional from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidate.
When Mr. Hart was arrested in 1987 on the Moneky Business ship and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she found that there was no reason not to consider the idea that she was also a candidate for the president.
That wasn't a well thought-out decision," she said with a smile 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Sneezy and seven bastards."
Since the campaign was already under way, she stayed with the collection of funds, so she said she wouldn't get into the race if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her gifts that were to give men $1,000 to her would give all of $250.
Do they think I have a vacation?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it difficult for her to collect resources and target the voters instead of their representatives, and the whites because of squawishism - from which she got into the throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder as the press responded to her.
You'd think Klenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would put me on my memory?
She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first canons of the US-China trade war were impressive, and until the end of the battle, the gap between the countries can be long-term benefits for Beijing, firm experts.
Donald Trump, the American president, launched the first warning at the beginning of this year by monitoring key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steels and aluminium.
The biggest hit took place this week with the new tariffs that hit items worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion dollars), which are practically overloaded by half of all slaves coming from China in the United States.
Beijing has returned the same measure every time, and the latest is the introduction of five to ten percent of American slave prices at $60 billion.
China claimed that the United States would respond the same way, and another, by the size of the world economy, is not going to stop soon.
To use Washington to withdraw means to satisfy demands, but the public cloning of the US would be too unpleasant for Xi Jinping, Chinese president.
However, experts claim that, if Beijing plays its next move well, US troops in the trade war can support China for a long time positively by reducing inter-economic dependence on two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a streamhead emergency in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," Abigail Grace said, a researcher whose focus is on Asia's New American Security Centre.
Syria is ready" for the return of a refugee, the Foreign Minister says.
Syria says she's ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in the restoration of a country that has been plagued by war for more than seven years.
Turning to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said that conditions in the country are improving.
Today the situation in the field is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew areas that have destroyed terrorists to restore normal lives.
Now there are all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the single economic measures that were directed to their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulam said that the Syrian regime would be better able to help restore the country of origin.
However, he stressed that he would not accept the help offered by any of the nations who helped the rebellion.
Europe has won Ryder's prize in Paris.
The European team won Ryder's 2018 summit. The US final score was 16,5 to 10,5 in Le Golf National van Paris, France.
So far, they have lost six times on the European ground and have not won Ryder's purchase in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the crown while the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won 14.5 points that they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who suffered during the entire tournament, initially shot a ball in the water at 16th floor, par 3, leaving the sword Francescu Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all rounds, and became one of the four players who have ever achieved up to 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament began in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 from Throbjorna Olisena from Denmark, the lowest-ranking player of the European team.
The world's best ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 of Ian Poulter from England who might have been the last Ryder buy.
Veteran with eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European winner of all the time with the winning 25.5 points in the career.
I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't stand it.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the purchase again.
Here's an important team and I'm glad I could be of help," said emotional Garcia after the European victory.
The driver gives his country John Rama, who won the legendary American golf player Tiger Woods 2 by 1 in one match per week.
"I'm incredibly proud of having defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four swords in France and now keeps a record of 13-21-3 careers on Ryder's team.
The extraordinary statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 biggest titles and remains only for Jack Nicklaus.
The American team suffered all weekend to find a way to the hole, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf all over the tournament.
After the disappointment of his team, American Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we gave up Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm breaking the thomas cap.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup team, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're overplayed."
