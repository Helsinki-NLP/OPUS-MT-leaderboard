Black box in your car?
While the U.S. road planners, who are slowing down in order to improve the freeway system, many people are looking at their solution in the small black box, which falls off your car's desk.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor driver and reports that information to authorities, has become the purpose of a married effort for the Washington and State Administration Office for the protection of the system's old-age traffic.
In general, the construction of air, such as air, has become the subject of sudden heavy rain and life-threatening floods.
The letters you have printed, and probably the location you have printed - and then to make use of this information - have been found with the Liberian public groups to support the use of these black boxes.
Chia party is expensive.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association is also very concerned about issues of different types of privacy.
While Congress could not agree on whether to proceed, many governments do not expect much.
They're looking for how they can get into a system that's going on the road for every mile.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for test drive, some of which include GPS monitoring.
It's really extraordinary for our country.
"This isn't about whether to be selected by us or not," says Hasan Ikharat, who is the official director of the Southern California Government, who is planning to start tracking each mile set by motorists in California by 2025.
It's going to change the way we're buried.
It's exciting to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's high-level trust fund has become a waste of waste, which is being sold by US citizens on gas pumps.
The Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Now a gallon is driving more slowly than before.
There was no increase in the federal taxis in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high value of gas, the government is also afraid of raising money in the taxis.
In Minosota University, evolutionist Le Monique says, "Gasing is not really a coincidence."
Their government has recently set up tracking devices in 500 cars to test the anti-missile system.
They say, "In the long run, it will work as the most logical option."
Wanks calls it a militia-based user Salk.
It's not surprising that this idea seems to be good for city volunteers, because it can change into a process for example driving, which can help reduce the damage of the game and reduce the greenhouse gas.
California's planners are eager for this system as they are developing tools to meet the targets set in the state's Global Warming Laws.
But the head of the home translation system, Rip. Bill Suster (A.P.) also holds the Black Box as the most practical long-term option.
The Reining Foundation is also in the context of self-destruction by the driver.
Police chief Adrian Moore said, "This is not just what goes into the dark corner."
People are crying more openly for what they are getting.
The initiative has also been supported by two former U.S. translators, who in 2011 had offered to move forward from Congress in their report.
The U.S. Senate approved a 90-million-dollar test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of the Grammian legislators, who represented those who have to go to work or go to the city for a long time, the eternal leadership ended the proposal there.
Nevertheless many kingdoms and cities are going forward in this way.
This is the most desirable Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
They will soon call on the Mile Zalk, rather than reject the kingdom.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is making progress in this regard too.
Elinois is trying with tracks on a limited basis.
The IE-95 mergers, which include the 17-nation section of former cybersex (with Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), are studying how they can act on this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nawada, where the device was placed on the cars of 50 free cars just a few days ago, the driver was too slow to think that the government could monitor all their actions.
In the Nahuatl Movement, Alauddin's director of the training and implementation system says, "There was a major concern about Big Brother and other things of the same kind."
It's not what people wanted.
Despite increasing testing, the U.S.A. of Nevada warned on its website: "It's easy to convert this device into a complete tracking device."
The extensive, unmanaged economic structure is not required to develop, which must be widely distributed to keep a record of each person's food supply.
Nawada is one of the many countries that are trying to achieve such an age, with which the government can get a description of how many cars are going every day, but not where and when they are going.
Juan said that if you can do that, people can feel easier.
The search for this pioneer brought some government agents to the small California Start-up called Tru Mileze.
It was not primarily in the business of helping drivers.
It was trying to get into the garage, where the drivers were to be buried on the ground of their ills.
But the device that is trying to test the device is good for HIV designers, because it does not use GPS and provides a lot of limited information, which is currently being downloaded by the modem on the Internet.
President Ryan Morrison of the Troo Miles said, "If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more willing to take this approach."
Some major mistakes have been made in these initial Kingdom programs.
There are also very low-cost and less-hand ways to do so.
In Oregon, designer drivers are using different options.
They can choose the device from the GPS unit or without the GPS.
Or they can choose no more devices, but they can choose to give a certain amount based on the means that are set by the Kingdom citizens.
In other places, it is hoped that it can be sold to interested citizens, rather than to lower the cost of the device.
In New York City, the transfer authorities are trying to develop a texting device that will also make it easier to hide the parking meter sludge, which will cause "sickness by drive" the disease, and create a collection of real-time speed data that can be used to protect from motor-motor traffic.
The city planning document says, "The motorists will be interested in participating in the benefits that come from it."
However, some evolutionists are surprised that the whole discussion may be a big debate on singing according to Mel.
In the San Francisco relief area, Metropolitan Oogue said that the problem of the Davalia Highway Trust Fund can be easily solved by increasing Congress gas taxis.
In addition to a single-time or annual washout on a hybrid or other motor vehicle, the vehicles do not use a lot of gas to attract their proper share.
The director of Iogue's department and public affairs, Randy Rentescheler said, "If it can work with Esperin, what does it need?"
If we do so, hundreds of thousands of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.

Snow Dan ready to join Germany on the U.S. window
Edward Snow Dan, U.S. President of the U.S. Supreme Court, has announced that Berlin is ready to travel to testify in Germany if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to his movements.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stro Belle, met Mr. Sno Dan Seguwar in Russia, where he was released to speak about the witness in Germany.
Sansad presented a letter to the media in Berlin with Mr. Sno Dan, saying: "Although the results of my efforts are positive, my government believes in intolerance as a change, and does not provide any protection that tries to criminalize the political speech with the attacks of Guandagardi."
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Sno Dan said that their belief that the support of an international community could discourage the American government from detecting violent attacks against them.
The U.S. Department of Justice includes theft from the secret police and government property.
Hans Peter Frederic, a member of German internal affairs, told online Zeit: "Mr. Snow Dun German authorities are ready to talk, so we will find ways to make it possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany has been under pressure because it has been claimed that the NSA has bugged the phone of Chancellor Angela Markel.
Thomas Operman, the president of the community of Sansad, is looking for fun information. He said that if Mr. Snow Dan had an opportunity as a witness to try "not to destroy relations with the United States completely and take them in danger," he should also take it.
Mr. Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Sno Dan on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their way to Russia.
Mr. Belley said, according to the previous NSA policy, if they left Russia, Snow Dan Russia will not be able to return.
If Snow Dan witnessed in Nazi Germany, he would be "safe" there that would require trust, Sand said.
Mr. Sno Dan said in his letter, "They had to face a storm and a storm," and he had to be forced to leave.
Although they said that global responses are happy and hopeful "to their work of political expression."
The United States and the United States, along with the world’s citizens, have witnessed the disappearance of an independent system of public service supervisors.
The letter extends a proposal to assist the German authorities "when human situation problems have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Carey - On Bagage
The Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for normal cari-on storage for passengers on their flight board.
It's planned to start charge for $100 for a carie-on-bag in Frontier Airlines, and it's going to be worth $2 for coffee or cheese, although it's announced that the travelers can keep a full deficit.
The new cari-on-sulk overhead is for bugs, so the small bug under the seat is still out: it's going to be salted.
Frontier said $25 would be charged if they'd be buried in Edwards, they'd have to wait $100 if they'd wait for the journey to land until they're on the gate.
Frontier user Kate O'Malley said $100 should be made available to take care of the charge in Advans.
"We don't want to charge him," they said.
In 2008, Irish began the charge for the first and second exams.
Those who are trying to save the passengers are doing what they can to do in Cari-on-Bugage that is stationed in overheated debbes, which means that there is often less space in this debbe.
There's a way to reduce travel on a smooth board.
O'Malley said it's not really about getting the new charge money.
It's for the most loyal players about Frontier that it's been hard to find the surface without.
This does not have to be given to tourists who buy tickets on their website.
This means that the next person on the line can be given $100 for a single bug, while a traveler on a franchise may easily get a bug on the line.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in processes have been changed to make sure that the travelers know about Fiz before they get the gate.
Frontier's new cari-on-fiss, will not start until the fevers, even though a date has not been determined.
Travelers often express discontent about salt and other salts, but air services like them.
They argue that the budget is costing, and those who want to serve should be invited to do so.
A lot of money is being spent to cover the cost of air travel in many years after the loss of several airlines.
Most have not even been able to buy a car - On Bug.
Spirit Airlines Inc. began three years ago in the Caribbean, and the co-discounter Allegian Air later.
With such a sludge, there is another Wizz Air of the Irish Hungary, the Irish consultant who Sorensen said, and the ad-on-fiss track.
They said that Spirit's cari-on-sulk brings $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, former governor of the Middle East Airlines, recently flew into the spirit and surprised visitors to face a cari - on - the - side unusual bug face on the Gate.
"The boarding process I saw in my Irish career was easy," they said.
I was hoping to see out on the South Pisena and a war jet.
"It was full of faith, and they said, "it's lickety-split."
Frontier's also following 2 bucks for coffee, tea, cheese, or juice for spirit.
Frontier's good that those who leave, or take it, can keep the whole dump, and this free coffee will only be given for once.
It will still draw water away.
In 2008, the U.S. Airways tried to compete for oil supplies, but seven months after the arrival of the travelers, they left and followed any other main Irish after being there.
Travellers from Frontier's were not selling directly from the Internet, this step is your new attempt to move customers to their own website to celebrate Carey-On.
Eerlins calls on the online traffic vendor Orbitz for every $25 hits like this.
That is why all Airlines have been encouraged to move travel directly from one of them to another instead of going through an online traffic agency.
Frontier, however, has gone forward in this area.
In September a number of flights began to take place in the distance of the mile for the farmers who bought them from an online traffic agency
It broke down 25 percent of the Trip May.
Thus, an online traffic agency buys 1,000 miles from the Frontier Trip 250 miles away.
It's also that they allow them to choose their seats in the future for single travelers when shopping directly from the Frontier website.
In the Danver of Frontier, there's a faithful base in the city of his own house, but it's getting less and it's losing money.
In the state, 9 percent of the population and its flight capacity have decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the growing financial results of the Corporatian Republic Irish Holdings Index.
They're trying to determine Frontier as a part of the Republican Ireland's Bicycle.
UNS called on " Internal Error" instead of Hackers to be a website crash
The secret national security agency told Saturday that our website was closed for a few hours because of a lack of technology, not because of hackers, as some people claimed online.
"NSA.gov has not been accessing tonight for several hours, which was due to an internal error during an earlier update."
Tonight's gonna solve this problem.
It's not true that this ban, widespread denial of service [D.O.S.] was due to the attack.
Last night the online server trackers found that the N.S. website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is not yet accessible for some users.
The U.S. user said to the U.S. News that the inside of A.J.'s internal, sensitive network with "Bilcule" was not understood.
The user said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hackivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for building the website of the N.S.A. by us.
The D.O.S. is designed to send traffic to the target website so far, until the site is closed because the server is overloaded.
This is an unexpected Siberia strategy, and the target target system will not be able to access the internal network.
In the past few months, the most mysterious N.S.A., which has been called "no such agency", has become the subject of debate and debate among the general public over the events of foreign and domestic Jewish programs - which have been widely ignored by the N.S.A. Commander Edward Snowen, who has been secreted by the N.S.S.S.S.S.A. files by secretaries and secreted by the E.S.
As a result of this growing debate about Agensi, these arrests were held today after the night's event, which was the result of the Siberian operation to be observed.
A beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the 'one and one-off' words in the context of the past and today's situations.

About one and a half months after the first flight of the pilot, it's only three times fired, asking whether the pilot is on the track or not.
The result was a decrease in preview and has been sent to more than 8 per cent of the Sheir Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorssen, a researcher at the National Bank Financial, has lost his rating for "the field display" from Goruvar to "the show" in the next one or two months.
"Kmajor flyman dealers were expecting more, we are clearly disappointed at the Margin exhibition," Dorssen said in a client note.
We'll get a new order for Bombardier CSries as the pilot test program progress.
However, if no new order is being announced in the months to come, there is no doubt that the branch program will be suspicious.
Bombardier hopes that the fly family can cut it off at the end of the low-cost bus station in Boing and Irbes.
The first test was performed in March and was launched for the first time in September after the last month.
The possible new client waits for a flight test to confirm company claims about the new Jetliner's hardware and the possible safekeeping, but such as through a fixed order for CSieres to 177.

The authorities urged the media to keep track of the program in accordance with the list.
"The pilot flight was on the ground for a long time compared to the forecast," Bodwin said in a conference call, adding that it was also determined during the middle of the Earth's testing and software update.
Each creator creates a different kind of shadow.
We had decided to fly first, and a update, and said, "What have we done?"
That's why it's all going to be through the flying program.
The rest of the five pilots are expected to fly in the coming weeks, the company said
However, analysts suspect that a CSeries flight study could begin within 12 months of its first flight.
Bombardier said it was valued for the service list (EIS) and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow speed of the air test -- although with Bombardier's internal register on the line -- will be reduced to Q1/15 by confirming our idea of entering the service," Dorsen said.

In the European state, 13 percent of the population is $2 billion.
Bombardier said that the world's largest trainer, in development, had grown by about 11 percent for the government at $2.1 billion.

The authorities had seen 32-year-old Scarboro in Blackburn, Lancashire, holding three cocaine bags at Wakile's house, while he went out with his colleagues for the Lo Sociati Diner.
After the children of the detective, his boots, and his credit card found cocaine in his cell, he found out that he was a "regular user" of the Detta A class's female teeth.
During a period of eight months between January 2011 and August 2011, he tried to get information about the illegality of the two arrests of Skarboro and his assistant.
As part of the main investigation of Lakesshire, Cuba, Marsied, Burkeshire and West Yorkshire, the police were under the control of all four suspects.

U.N. has set new targets to extract from resource
The United Nations is about to start work on a new set of targets, which will replace the current development goals, which were launched 12 years ago to achieve global stability.
In 2015, to replace M.D.D., Australia's government played the first important role in promoting the "extraordinary Development Goals", starting at the Rio de Janeiro conference.
These were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by the world leaders at the summit with Mr. Gillard.

For two weeks the conflict between government courts and Renomo has been reported nearly a day, a peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Remo was once part of the country's free government’s efforts to establish it, after which a wave of opposition to Angola was supported by the white-controlled Rhodesia and the colored government of South Africa.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an independent party.
Researchers believe that it is not possible to return to the country’s entire developed conflict, but recent events have encouraged foreign investors and local people.
The sun is rising faster for the regime, which can lead to more than $50bn in the next year's investment in Rio Tinto, Brazil's Valley.
Seventeen - year - old Frelimo Party, after 1975, blames each other for the political forces, and the Remo tension.
Remo says the government launched the latest war on its members on 17 October, bringing peace to the country, a renomous disaster.
In the wake of the attack on the former rebels and the government forces attacked the Renmo sites, and the head of the group, Fernando Migang, told the financial Times of the attempt to kill Remo's employer.
The government has charged Renomo with assaults against the military.
Nationalist Armando Gibuz has demanded to ignore concerns about stability.
Mr. Gibuzan told the mayor of Africa, the French news agency that Mr. Takakama viewed himself as a "house" "anyhow he tried to prove his troops that he could apply his own decision to the government."

They're saying FT doesn't respect when it's done by Free Lime.
Our view is to return to the speaker, but seriously," Mr. Meong said.

A new party, a former Remo member, who hopes to improve its performance in the elections of the Democratic Foundation of Mozambique (MDM), is beginning to arrive in Maddan in late 1992, when a new party, a former Remo member, was created.
Mr. Mysang Mr. Gibuzan says that the next year, which has left the end of its second term, wants to destroy the nation of the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-ethnic society, he doesn't want to abandon nationality because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want a transparent choice," said my lord.

Benjamin Greenman: tenth anniversary of the New York Committee's zeal: The New York
People can argue that the standup committee was born in New York City, U.S.A., about a hundred years ago, the journalist Frank F., who worked as a teacher at the Pallas Theater in Broadway, started speaking directly to the audience.
The search has been expanded over the years, most recently, in New York's comedy Fostyville.
This zeal, created and activated by Caroline Hersh, the founder of the Stadup Institute, Caroline's 10th anniversary, which included more than a dozen clubs and large theaters this year.
The Irish say, "Most of them appear in the Hedliners Carolins, and have been very successful, to the extent that they have become very big to be played in the club."
We created this desire to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefit for military personnel in Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up Forthroz", which includes Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Walters, and Bill Cosby.
The world of comedy has also expanded with the expansion of enthusiasm.
A lot of those who participate in this year's campaign have come from uninterrupted media, such as comedy Central, F.X. and Spike, who come to a small network.
Black Crowl arrived at the main location from the DP-Cable Setcom (F.X.S.), a popular Ron's Fantasy-Football theme, "The League", and now their self-command is central chess.
Jenny Slate's "Saterde Nit Life" and "Parks And Retirement", although they're best known for their virtual video series "Marselle de Shell Weid Suz On."
With Carol and Slate, other young voices comedian (Bulkul-C-Belkul-Aleg) is the founder of the United States-based world.
One of the main objectives of the campaign will be to speak to Larry David Steinberg:
Steinberg had started working as a standup committee, but they have become a famous television and film director, as well as an informal committee historian.
From 2005 to 2007, they hosted the "Site Down Commission World David Steinberg" on the TV land.
This meeting will be held at the center of Manhattan, Town Hall.
Steinberg said, "The city certainly is in the D.N.C.'s committee of all the work of Larry."

The oil's going to be going on at $96 per barrel.
A report of concern to the oil price continues to be carried out on Friday, as a more representative of China, where power-building areas are being strengthened in China.
In December, the New York Mercentile Excendentage for the Banking of the United States of America was $19.24 down to the late morning in Europe at 14 cents.
The ban was 5.8 percent down for the month of October, 39 cents on Thursday.
A sufficient amount of oil is spent in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department told the mayor that the U.S. government has grown 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, more than 25 million barrels have increased in size.
But one of the recommendations for a strong demand has been made by Izafa that two reports on Chinese construction came in February.
This suggests that since the last 7.8 percent of the population in the third quarter of the population can continue to strengthen China's financial improvement.

The Court has suspended action against the New York Police Department and the law of credit.
A joint appeal court in Thursday called for a court order for the New York Police Department to oppose and order a judge for the Crimean Program to reverse the changes and remove the case.
U.S. Circuit Court 2nd Judge Shira Sindaller said that the decision-making results will be extended to an appeal by the city.
The judge had decided in August that he had decided to stop people and quit his interrogation program.
The City Police Department also includes the decision to appoint an officer to assist in changing its rights and training program, its absence and its medical order.
The court heard the testimony on the request for permission to leave.
Apelle Justice said that because he understood the need for a judge to escape the presence of a judge in part of a media witness in order to protect from the situation of the West and to distinguish himself from the six U.S. judges by the public, he should be removed from the judiciary so that he should be publicly repared to consider the justice of the statements.
The judge had heard that the police had misjudged the civilian authorities of thousands of people, looking at black and Spanish men with their bans and credit programs.
He has appointed an external monitor to monitor major changes with financial improvements in innovations, training and monitoring, and has become more and more closed where a pilot program has been ordered to test the first cameras of the body in some areas.
In August, New York City, whose case was charged with the arrest of a police officer, granted permission to complete their name and address storage duty.
The city’s appeal is marked for some time after March 14, 2014.
The R & D has been discussed with civil authorities.
The regime and the cridha have been around for decades, but the majority of black and Spanish men, from 684330 to 2011, have been forced to stop the administration of free Mayer Michael Blumberg for a while.
In 2004, a court case of four men was held by all the censuses and became the subject of a class trial.
In the NYPD's protest and credit program, a reformer said that a more reliable and effective police force would end the alleged conduct and could influence the use of the police of the other police department.
Opposers say changes will reduce police manoeuvres, but crime, money abuse, and not the last decade will solve a huge problem of police force under pressure under the regime.
The judge has noted that there was no end to obstacles and criticism, which is selective, but has been improved in the implementation of the NYPD stop.
And there were many that had been counted worthy of gaining honour, and that were counted worthy of double honour.

Colson used a phone hacking to verify secret information
Former editor Andy Colson of the New York World has been accused of using the "phone hacking, surveillance and surveillance" in an attempt to verify a specific information about their system connections while Charles Clark's house is being repaired.
Projector Andrews K.C. told Old Bally that the news of the World had heard a false complaint in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "Special Adviser" Hannah Polby.
The court stated that the press had appointed private investigator Glen Malkeier to hack into the police station and to "keep watch", but Colson also called and left his office.
Mr. Addiss said, "The suggestion is that Mr. Colson, who are now editors of the N.O.D.D., is not going to stand outside of the people's house, but they're writing to the people, see how people react to it."
They said that N.O.D.D. used three ways to check the issues: phone hacking, surveillance, and surveillance.
The third family included the editor itself.
Clearly, he knew about the steward in another way, that is, he must have known.
What about the former?
Did they know about the phone hacking?
They say, no, we say, "Yes, they knew it."
For the first time since the U.T.D.F.F.D.D. disk was posted on Clark's program meetings, when a wanted source in Susre Polby said, "Don't waste your time, it's with Charles."
From house to house in August 2006, at least three times from Susrie Polby's phone, the Wismel tape was posted.
The inspectors also found entries on the computer of the private examiner, which were named by Sir Polby and his sister as "project".

Mr. Addis said that including Colson in this matter is in the other important persons' parton, such as the former real David Blancett.
The judge told Guwar that Colson had talked to Mrs. Blancett about wedding relations with a married woman, while he was seeing the case of Mrs. Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.

James Clever, the director of the U.S. National Security Council, stressed that the United States is not using September to steal secrets from foreign companies and to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their line below."
But since Edward Snowden, a director who made Visblower, started to tell the U.S. Governor of the European Government and the business world, the director is no longer sure that he can't keep his word.

A survey published by the German companies in July is to be followed by a survey published by the German companies, the United States has become almost as big as China, when it comes to stealing medical insurance and data.
In all the works, Mr. Snowdon took, there is no evidence, yet, that the United States has gone to Russia for foreign companies.
The governments have exposed the insensitivity of the European Union’s Internet capabilities, and they must strive to reduce their dependence on the United States.
The world's business leaders are doubting this.

In Germany, there is a lot of work to do, including driving, driving, and driving.
But it's all there is.
The U.S. technical findings and scientific access have proved to be an insult to some companies that were once considered the most dangerous risks to the U.S.
A major change is being made in the cloud computering area where the European authorities are more careful that the data stored in the United States is under that authority and thus become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey published by a business agency, some 10 non-American members of the Club Security Alliance canceled their plans to use an American-based Cloud Provider after the opening of the data-based dance program.
Jim Snaby, the chief executives with SAP, say: "We have seen a new question that had not come to the collectors a year ago -- that's -- my data says it's stored? Can you guarantee that it will be physically in that area of authority?"
Many German authorities reason that the latest report simply confirms that the powerful government wants to steal their most precious secrets and data and that it should be on every price.
It's not an amazing thing that the economy has to do with it.
It's always coming.
"This is a matter for many years, and by means of the main current discussion, nothing changes," says Kurt Bock, chief worker of the Russian creator BASF.
The United States's economic and economic pressure is on us and we do it too, because it's in the national way to protect our work.

Although small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring this is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it's unique in a number of companies worldwide.
"The small and medium-sized company often lacks experience, work and financial resources to protect corporate secrets against unauthorised access," BfV warns in a report.
The United States has warned other countries about its own companies' financial surplus.

The parents of Georgia's youth who were killed in the 'other disasters' believe that their son had been killed.
A boy in Georgia whose dead body was hidden in his high school gym in a restling match believes that their son had been killed, something the head of the family said to Guwar.
Valdosta, G.S. Central Johnson, was placed in a straight-to-right match on January 11th after their high school gym.
Researchers at the London County Sheriff concluded that Johnson died in a ‘one-off accident’, but the family of a 17-year-old boy refused to do so.
Writer Benzamin's team, representing Kenneth and Jackson Johnson, said to Fox New Dot Com, "They are absolutely convinced that their son has been killed."
And they trust not in death at all in the name of the seraphs.
The group said, "They believe that this is contrary to physical law and general wisdom."
They think it's an accident for the death of their son or for the safety of the responsible person or the people.
They said, "They sent their son to school with a book bag, and he returned to a body bag."
U.S. President Michael Muulre told Guruvar that he was examining a medical examination of Johnson's death, seeing that many important questions were answered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a crime?
I heard these words in a press conference on Thursday.
I'll follow them wherever they take us.
My intention is to face the truth.
They said, "I think there's a reason for a formal investigation."
Mure told the reporter that there are signs of Johnson's death as a result of the "situation of the state".
According to the Urim and the Thummim, there was a different cause of death in a second test."
They said: "How many questions shall be answered, if they are truthful?"
Mure also said that if they find sufficient evidence to find a criminal in the death of Johnson or to check out civil authorities, they will tell F.B.I. to do it.
Not immediately available for comments from the London County Sheriff's office when connecting to Thursday.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to continue all the surveillance videos reviewed by the inspectors.
The child's parents say they hope to find some signs of his death from the video fottage.
C.C. has passed on to students the Elerge Guidelines for Children
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention continued to provide guidelines for the control of children's food Elerge in the school.
The U.S. government has implemented such guidelines for the first time, as the number of children attending school is increasing to be suffering from allergic eating.
Now in the U.S., a 20 - year - old is eating an allergic reaction.
C.D.C. found that 18 per cent of children in children between 1997 and 2007.
In this direction, students are informed how teachers and workers are informed about the food of children, and how they are treated in the event of an allergic reaction.
Students have also been advised to keep Apnefrin's stock to meet the likely known pregnancy (naphylaxis), which is the auto-injector of the Epipen Brand, which is most commonly used.
The Council of Ministers has recently updated the laws, which allow students to keep the stock of Apnefrin in more easily.
This report also includes a list of common notes transmitted by children affected by allergic reactions.
The kids can say, "There's something going on in my life," "I think it's on my life," or "I'm getting stuck in my life."
The parents of Intersexual Kids can choose ‘unfounded links ’ of their children
The German European Union's first country has become a country that has granted the approval of the third line for children born with a lack of natural affection.
The children will no longer be identified in a basic way by men or women.
According to the new law, parents do not need to publish links for such children, this law allows them to declare lines on the child's birth certificate 'unique' or 'unique'.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce pressure on parents who can, in particular, bring about decisions on the health and health of young children, and fight against sexual harassment against children.
According to B.C., an interviewer said years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm going to make a jacket made by the doctors.
According to estimates, every year a child is born to 2,000 children who are neither a child nor a child.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 situations, which is the result of an examination of the differences in sexual development, which is a collective word used for abnormal characteristics, generality (indation or extension), or an abnormally developed line.
Well, maybe Wales's symphony is in the middle of an intersex.
Lying identification is still not correctly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when a line cannot be constructed, it is best to use the best available information to identify the line and to investigate, if so, to monitor the scientific and physical development of the child before such a visit.
In New York City's mental-scientific Dr. Jack Dr. Drecher, who is an expert in the affairs of Ling-Pahan, said that the new law of Germany "sees to be good."
Intersex children create moral uncertainty.
They said, "Some people are in a situation that requires health care, but most children are not."
You can only specify a line without a silica, and then see how knowledge develops.
How a ling would develop in a child, it's not very true science to know.
No one can properly answer why this happens.
It's a kind of question why people are gay.
In 2011, an interview with the European Commission in 2011, an interview with an interview has been described differently from people who are transsexual or transgeneral, because their situation is not related to Ling, but is related to their physical design, which is neither a man nor a woman, nor is a combination of both, nor is any of them clearly defined.
These features can present themselves with secondary sexual symptoms, such as manspasian frequency, infant distribution, blood and longevity; primary sexual symptoms such as prosthesis and gender; or personality development and hormones.
The report also gives insight into the crimes of torture, violence and theft faced by individuals in the area of drug trafficking, as well as the victims of torture, violence and theft.
Now there's a special scar for kids who have a non-informal bonding.
Australia and Nepal have already been authorized to mark older persons on their official documents, men, women, or "Tatural Ling".
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie Me-Welby became the world's first-class "Lingless" person after the legal appeal was won.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, there will also be a third definition for persons with M or F, other than those with an X.
According to a report on France 24, matters related to Ling in France are still getting married.
In 2011, hundreds of French legislators from this Catholic country have signed on the file to return to "Ling principles" from the textbooks of the school.
The U.S. website Catholic online has also contradicted this German law, saying, "Because the world is going in such a situation, the choice of Ling itself is being chosen, but we are not acting, we are taking the two and the columns of the universe in a different direction."
The mother of the newborn child in Maryland also told Baby John that she would like to see the children mentioned at the time of their birth.
They said about corruption on the website, "Speech is very serious without other limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's line is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, the male and female born children with two Genangs were referred to as Harmafrouds (Ugilingi), who were named after the beautiful Greek god who was duallingi.
And almost a decade ago, the medical world considered Ling to be a slat that had been removed and could be rewritten.
But now that many people are challenging the morality of health care, they realize that it's a long-term job, and sometimes it's a mistake for doctors, who don't know how to feel about their addiction when children grow up.
Dreshr said, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "Monologs forever."
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychologist, you called the surgeon.
The current principles of treatment of children with a lack of natural affection were presented by Dr. John Mani of the University of John Hapkins, who considered the Ling to be representative.
They developed the word "Ling Knowledge" and explained how social and environmental signs -- how they interact with children -- interacting with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a man or as a woman.
But in one case in 1966, which is known as "John/Joan", their principles became controversial.
They advised a child, who had been hit by an accident during the Ling Agrahmer-Hungarian (Sermisation), to give his parents advice that they be completely attached to the child and give him his fingerprints and be his daughter-in-law.
The director said, "I presented the case as a success of the transition, but it didn't."
At the age of 15, the child returned to being a man and married to a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dreshr said some doctors are still "following another image."
But with the arrival of the Internet in the year 1990, these people who have access to medicine began to face "not happy with the results."
That was the case with 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce of Montana, who was born with a male character, but his general name was unclear.
The doctors didn't clearly understand whether his line was small or large, but they were sure that he could never live as a man.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, he was released from the outer ring of Bruce and Andkoša Sali-chichitha and was released as a nurse.
He was given to a 12-year-old woman named Hormon.
He said to the ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was hard to ask.
At 18 years of age, he was supposed to be a vasinoplastic.
But he asked for medical records, with a sense of nosedness and a few deep feelings.
The fear of God made him know the truth.
I was held in custody at the time of my birth, and no one told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., who prevented his body from developing a testosterone in sufficient proportion, which caused his genetic development.
After learning the truth, he became a man, he took the testosterone and removed his nose.
Because of his patience, he was despised.
Today, he believes in an interface project organization called the Intersex to make people feel normal about themselves.
However, the various groups of the California-based Advocets for Information Chewis, the leading director of the Timor-Matis, expresses concern that the German law "invits chips and cookies."
They say, "A lot of extremists think the law of Germany will prompt the parents to make rapid decisions and send the child to define "unfounded."
We're afraid it will encourage the handcuff.
We think it's better to specify a man or a woman's line than to wait.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Timer-Matis said their organization supports Australia's law because "it allows the elderly to be identified in the third line."
They said, "The age should be able to decide for themselves on a regular line."
German law is related to specifying it during birth.
It's not a jungle fighting by the new kids at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Pittsburgh's dance radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz whose daughter is disinclined by Yon's development, who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would "give power to both parents and children."
The son of Katy of Baratji was born with male characteristics, but he had a complete D.S.D.
Because he was wrong in the Androsion Grai, there was a woman's identity in the cathet.
His body is in the flesh, but he is not in the body, but in the giving of thanks.
She is now a 29-year-old married woman and is a director of the Bal-Minology Department at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although he's a cop, he hopes to be a mother through a god or a gas station.
Baratz said, "This law recommends parents not to make their own decisions soon."
It provides them with the right understanding and time before they write "man" or "woman".
So, you're gonna be all right - take care of the child, love the child.
You have a child who loves you and likes him.
We don't need to do something that can't be returned soon.
They said, “This brings children into the decision-making process, and frees their parents from want, because they do not believe that they are doing the right thing.”
Finally, the child will decide which line is easier with -- and it'll be a very good word.
It enables children to decide for themselves.

Report: For Hilary Client, consider the biting Obama engine.
According to the New York Times, close advisors of the nation’s Barack Obama secretly considered Hilary Clinton’s position on the post of Beden.
The most outstanding warning in the Rasoddhatn is that Mark Halperin and John Helemann were heavily expected by the 2012 Aaiyan Tom, "Dubble Down: Change the game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the book Next and announced yesterday evening that the president's top advisers could help Obama re-elect the upcoming elections in order to get to know what to do in order to be organized by Obama's top advisors in the "excellent group sessions and later in 2011.
According to the Times, the book National Political Dialogue, Jonathan Martin, tells of the impact of the change in Paul from the vice president of the former State’s secretary, Witt House, on the initiative of the principal authority, and on the theme of the name White Houses Staf.
The possible exchange was a very secure secret within the natural tent of the Ark of the Ark and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen national advisers – along with Dalai, former Obama Aaiyan Chief Jim Massina, and former White House advisors, were aware of the changes of David Oxford and David Pluffe.
“ Double Down” claims that the dance tried to change the scene before their personal decision was finally made in spite of the taalmel, and their information would not be improved in the case of Obama, the client's ticket.
In a witness with Martin, Dale confirmed that the administration was actually thinking about the client's location with Biden.
"I said, 'I saw the whole vision, and it was one of them,' he said to the reporters.
And remember when the people of the city were in danger, and We said: Holy, what shall we do?
When Dale told the research as "Warning," Martin told CNN's Andersen Cooper that the election agency has invested a significant investment in how much it would benefit this search.
"They don't spend attention on middle- and middle-class groups as much as they think seriously," Martin told the C360.
It's unclear, Halaki, whether Obama knew their team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he had asked him if he knew about the possible change in their boss?
When Dale said they didn't know about possible changes to the state, the former Chief of Staff thought it was "probably" that it knew Obama.
"Dubble Down" is certain: won't reply if the government checked Obama's disk? Martin said again.
Cooper asked Martin if they had thought seriously about Obama's biting ticket research.
"Probably," Martin said.
Do you like Glo-in-Dark ice cream?
A British scientist has made use of the world's first glass-in-de-Dark ice cream-jelfish.
Charlie Frances has made a lot of use of marine animals to develop better disasters.
This thought came to him after reading a letter of inquiry on Jelifish, and Chinese scientists needed to rescind the protein with Russian light.
The ice cream, which the consumers respond to the ice, will increase the protein's pH and the ice cream will be lit.
Chris says that the ice cream reacts to the heat of the mouth, that is, victory will be more cutting, and that will be even more popular.
Lick I am the founder of the M.I.I.E.I.S.A., Charlie said, "This is incredible, but I'm going to get about two grams of £200 in the first days."
The protein we're using on the screen will react to the neutral PCH in the gel.
Just as the mouth is hot, the protein PH will increase and the ice cream will be lit.

George Kreeving: The Euro Open has chosen Scotts
Another Day, Another Story of Freedom
We have been warned this time that it will require free Scotland to join Europe as a member of the U.S. membership.
On Berwick, the passport controls and the doors of Haddrine indicate stories about the border of the county area.
It is true that Stratclied Paper described the possible financial benefits of free voice with the rest of Europe, although it was not described in the headlines by default.
No one has explained that U.S. members spend most of their time changing their professional rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, Brazil will be completely free for Brazil rather than actually getting what it wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Qahani.
And the thing that's been going on for so long has been happening. I've heard the news about "freedom means passport control" 40 years ago.
Still, this fascinating old story has been lost to hear it again.
Why, though, should we expect Europe to grow from free Scotland?
Why is it to be practiced for the Brussels of London, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the Great, War and Peace Plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe is officially dead.
In the entire U.S., dedicated forces are gaining strength to oppose or shut down the euro as the same currency.
So far in Germany, the Euroscaptyl International for German Party - whose establishment this year has been – soon received about five million votes in the joint election of September, thus effectively removing Free Democrats (as compared with our Lib Dems).
The plans to create a united Europe are always against home.
However, the current financial crisis has proved to be a major change.
As well as the harsh rules imposed by the Berlin and European Central Bank, many people are thinking that the project Europe has been far away because of the restrictions imposed on national regulations by pursuing the same currency.
Not much of Europe's disaster was the most devastating loss of national governments -- it was just the truth about Greece.
Rather, the Euro system has set its members a currency exchange rate in the German exporters' currency – something they want to keep German politicians.
Without the possibility of a homeless currency, South Europe finds itself in a vulnerable situation where it is comparable to Germany.
It is the only way to reduce van and public affairs - which is encouraged by Berlin.
A major European producer is already suffering from the problems of gambling and smoking.
In order to reduce French and German Urza plants to users, the results of Brazil's "every" Ugarit islands, the European Udigo, are four crimes against Biglia and gas compared with the United Nations.
This is the most devastating damage we've ever seen in Gringhamuth.
Even if all the goods are released in the world, Europe's petrochemicals will not be able to protect itself from being affected by all of the U.S. Shell gas.
As a result, people are becoming more and more disillusioned, especially in France, which was once the leading praise of the U.S.
After the war, the top French politicians saw the U.S. under control of Germany, and the Persians viewed it as a means to provide a building like Vansigtan in the world.
But Berlin does not need Paris as a passport for political integrity now, and it has applied its own financial policies to Europe, which is why France's rule of law is breaking down.
As a result, the South African National Front of the United States of America has won the victory at the recent summit of the seventh Socialists.
At this time, France has the most popular group with 24 percent vot - it's a timely warning for British labs that they can't go without the fact that it's going to be useful for the left, for the right.
What is Le Pen French villagers doing with their new experience among the working class?
This group wants to create a major anti-dumping problem in the European Union, using the next year's U.S. elections.
If, as far as possible, the U.S. opposition groups show good results in these elections, this kind of group can affect the European community for the first time.
My view is that Europe will soon end the struggle against the U.S. and all the pressure against Europe.
The euro will not be fully completed, but it will come back in a way that will support the General De Gol.
Germany and some of its compliance rules can maintain Europe, but France and southern Europe will resume their printings.
I expect the U.S. will keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing its neighbors with the U.S.
However, the growing trend in the psychiatry indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What's going to happen to Scotland later?
We can choose to remain in the area of Little England (requiredly).
Or we can protect our own financial interests -- which includes telling Berlin and Brussels to be different at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better work in the vast European system, hoping that we will keep our own press.
It will be easy to work in Europe with other countries of similar opinion.
Otherwise we should think about keeping our financial freedom on the way to Norway.
In Scotland, the S.N.P. government - notably Europe - has been the most successful anti-militarist political campaign in Europe, which has been the most exciting in the year 2011 on the basis of the Thori-Lib Dem collection of coins presented by the Chancellor Alister Darling of Liberia.
It would be a mistake to vote for freedom for Scotland at this time, because in that situation it will have to be adopted by Berlin and Brazil's laws of subsidiarity.
Before time: Soon to grow up
Research shows that African-American and Spanish girls are getting younger in age compared to their older adult girls.
Physical changes do not mean that youth is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other substances can be blamed
Specialists believe that violence can be a cause of youth in less recent times
The situation of young people is not as effective as before
In the health and family matters of the children of Ethriz children of the former UN, special papers are available.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter begins to develop the flowers and the baby’s birth at the age of 7 or 8?
This week, in Orlando, Florida, at the annual meeting of the American Bal Chicchichits Academy of Medicine, Bal Chicchiatrist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these initial physical changes are common to American girls.
Caplowitz says, "I spend a lot of time trusting the demons -- that it usually doesn't show the cold progress towards full youth."
There has already been a time when there is a clear sign of development, such as the number of columns, the balsam, and the balsam, and the fleshy little girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a dramatic change in the period of resurgence (first month-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the dances begin to develop, the first rehearsal takes at least two and a half years," Caplowitz says, "in children, time-to-time youth: the guidance needed to deal with this common problem."
The most real test time of youth development is time.
Young's start is interesting, but when he was eight years old with the dance development, two of them call it "Birth-Birth".
In most cases this process will be slowed or stopped - which can be monitored by the child’s medical care.
In the case of faster progress, it may be necessary to check by the endocrineologists to remove the potential risks of tumors or systems such as major problems.
The early months of religion and other consequences are medicine: age-old age, which can lead to unaccompanied age and age.
Drugs or hormone therapy depend on the age of the child, development rate, age, and emotional age.
Mental science is also important.
The Caplovits are a joke about drugs, but they admit, "The pressure may increase morale, and the girls may feel different from their peers."
Another major problem can be understood: ethnics don't just want their daughter to be a religious girl.
He said, "They are concerned about the burden of pregnancy, or about how they are kept clean."
A woman whose daughter started a monthly religion at the age of 10 recalls, "This was a joke."
Although they were aware of this, and we also talked about the months and religion, but it was not emotionally prepared.
And he was afraid at his school, and went back grieved: for his fellowservants were the first of the first months of his life in the church.
There are many simple principles about the causes of anomaly youth.
However, there is no evidence that hormones, Russians, or the media could be charged with Jonah’s messages in the desert or other food items.
Boys -- just like girls -- are getting time-to-be-to-saves.
Caplovits determine the rule that it is the most important cause of corruption.
In 2001, they helped conduct a study on boys between 6 and 9 years of age, which adds body weight to youth.
Other results support this decision, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, in Africa-American and Spanish girls have the tendency to get yawn before they get their old-fashioned young girls.
There's a lot of clarification on this.
At the global level, the representation of early youth, from economic conditions to the west and the sexes, appears to be influenced by everything.
Other: Although boys are getting under the age of their faces and knees, the course of youth is not as clear as it is.
Other doctors present at the A.B.A. Conference supported the debate.
It is common even to see males and children born, the young children and grandchildren.
"We need to be careful about how we know how to start the real beginning of Yovan," says Dr. Lawrence Silverman in Morstown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to provide guidance to their children to take care of them in this regard.
Caplowitz advised, "This may mean talking before the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.
It takes confidence that girls who develop from time to time are well ahead of time, but it is part of normal life.
The temperature was 3.1 degrees Celsius per week.
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
The people went out into the field at the end of the week, and rose up and went up to their tents.

And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.

They will still keep on the watch, according to the watch of the night.
For the sake of simplicity, it is important to keep in mind that there is no limit to the amount of time that you spend in recreation and entertainment.
This month's Double Arrow is set up to launch a fight for Arsho between the front planes for long-distance flights to the width of the layout of the layout of the layout-class sets.
The debate is focused on the expansion of the economic class in the long flight, as always is given by Erlins, but the assigned location has claimed to be the key to lettuces Abbas SAS and Boing.
Erbes is hoping to give at least 18 inches (46 cm) of this week’s economy Cabin a wide range of Indian standards, but it should be determined by Erlins.
The dispute took place between the creation of the atmosphere and the sale of a large version of the long - distance archcraft from Order, possibly after the 17-21 event.
How was the last part of the plane built - especially if the setting 9 or 10 is equal to 10 being made in the design of a mini-gambo jets?
Boing says it's "777 X" that 406 people will be placed in a single unit of 10 pounds in 17 inches and one line in a single line.
Irbus says it's going to take 350 people to a set that's equal to 18 in the remaining nine.
In most cases, the air - conditioner’s ability to control the flow of traffic is influenced by the flow of traffic.
Now, Irbus, with 777 X, hopes to have more than 100 Order in Dubai, thus calling on the public.
It's recently seen that there's something going on in the beginning of the conflict. Would you agree to it in a restaurant and show it to Phinehas?
Erbes Bikry President John Lehi said "The long-term flight to the Boing District Turbo is also taking place in the affected areas."
As a change, people are getting big, but it's not the way to stay.
According to the U.S. Health Department, between the 1970 ’ s when Boing 747 animals and today’s long journeys were defined, and about 40 - 49 - year - olds in the United States grew by 10 percent.
According to U.S. Health Statistics, the average American male in the 21st century is 39.7 in.
The response of Irbes says that the situation of the new name "Jet Set" was interrupted by a 1950 earthquake.
Irbes says he has set up a research committee that recommends an additional correction in the width of the seat in the 53-phase sleep quality.
Boing discussed the figures on the bus scale, and it said that it does not depend on the decisions of the builders how the airline is to balance the costs and benefits.
It also says that the research from which it comes depends on the experience of more Kabin than the width of a set.
Boing Kabin, Specialist Count Craver, said, "It's really about giving the Irish people a little bit of a break and telling them what they need to do to succeed."
"How do they benefit us if they don't want to tell us about it?"
They know their business better than anyone else.
It's about the kitchen room for Fleyers, but it's a quick thing for representatives that it can affect the verse.
Following this debate, the trade rate of at least 700 Arab dollars is sufficient in the coming decades for US and European exports to compete with the air order.
For the first time in July, the reactor reported that it is a war between new jet planes that is actually set off.
Aerbes and Boing claimed that 20 percent of their newly-connected engineer design was active against the site, compared to 365-site Boing 777-300.
Boing’s presentation is estimated to be 10 to 777 X and 9 to 777 degrees Fahrenheit [- 9 to].
The unit is equal to 10 times the profit now.
Kevin Keniston, a European bus driver's head says, "Boing's flight is going to make more representations with our products and more seats."
On the other hand, researchers say that the entire 10-seat line Cabin is recommended for existing 777 S that many travelers are on the side of the donor layout, which can go along with all of them.
Kevin Internal Specialist, my career, founder and editor's Runwee's network, said, "It's going to be very good for eight-in-a-kind travel passengers, but it's true that this business point of Irbes is driven by the threat of 777."
I don't represent Irbus and Boing but I'm offering a list of representatives to choose from Irlines.
Make sure the jet vendors from around the world check this speeds match.
More restful, all the buildings are also offering low-cost flight services and high-quality tickets for a regional trip.
Irbus is giving you 10 equal to A350 but they say it's no longer worth it.
But recently, Irbes has forced some of its jet planes on the broad cabin seats for more Cabin facilities.
It is not possible to fly on a new wave standard without the support of other modern jet planes, but it can be removed from the path of the 777 x-axis.
The joy of the new anti-nicotine vaccine can result in the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that can end the drug encountering smoke.
One of the most expensive vaccines has been able to keep the bugs safe from nicotine's latrine for the rest of their lives.
Prior to the start of human testing, there is a need for a test, which may take years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Vul Cornel Medical College in New York said initial signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We very much hope that this kind of vaccine can eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the techniques available in the market today, but they have found that Nikitin's milk is stronger than the current methods."
There is a malicious virus in the new vaccine, which is designed to obtain genetic information from the purpose of creating an anti-nicotinic antidepressants.
This is the virus, which automatically activates the selected proxy, which then starts to build a static database of the Index.
Antibodies are looking for any nicotine in the blood, and prevents the smoker from swallowing the nicotine in the stomach before they get into the stomach.
In the trial, vaccines were given to those who were subsequently given nicotinics, who were doing their normal actions.
Researchers say that, but the error that was not given was "good," it was a sign that Nicotin had reached his limit.
This use was described in the journal Science Translating Medicine.
The old tabako vaccines were failed because they had an antibodies.
It had to open up on the regular Internet to create the level of Antibodies, but it proved to be great and unusual.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high, because this will make it an antibodies factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine of the future is fully protected, it can be given to children, before the cigarettes become available today, which can save them from nicotine salt.
But it may be used to stop smoking by people who smoke it.
They said, "They'll find out that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy smoking because of nicotine, which can help them break their habit.
British scientists said that the results were negative, but they warned of the need to do more research.

The former NSBL Srm Prime Minister Joe Tripod, who refused to violate his political Guru A.D., the protector of the former New South Wales, A.D., whose government-controlled land was free.
In response to corruption, IOG (ICAC) explained on Friday that Mr. Obied had failed to break the list of board rules for several government departments, where Obied's admitted two restaurants and coffee, without the Tener's renaissance, ended in August 2005.
After the witnesses handed down by the former Chief of Staff, Lin Aspole was aware of the privacy of Mr. Tripod Mr. Obid's complaint?
During the years of the talks in 2005, the government had forced the board to start public tenders.
The robbers were against it, and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the paper industry for boards, with Obid spending $2.5 million a year, was renovated from the board’s tank.
Mr. Tripodi, who was a member of the parties from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the front of the public tender.
But they refused to change Mr. Obid's approach, Mr. Tripod had asked for a change in government board rules.

"No," Mr. Tripod answered.
I can't remember what I was talking about, but it was definitely not.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obid.

A foreign worker can run 457 games with a "validity" test
The government is considering a "validity" test for foreign workers in 457 videos, as it aims to expand a difficult operation.
If it is self-tested, it will be applied by means of a standard designed to prevent 457 persons who are being used to fill or access family and friends in Australia.
Today, a letter of government has been sent to the peoples of the country, protesting the Government's statements about foreign workers, former Leber M.P. Mackin Maccuo said today that it could offend the neighboring countries of Australia.
He told the American Institute today that "foreign people are arriving at the end of the line" and "Australian people are very unhappy at a time when the Union has asked for a secure market."
Historically, it was the impression that white Muslims should be protected -- and if some people in the area have seen opposition to that historic witness, I wouldn't be surprised.
The paper presents 12 applications, which were previously considered by former Minister Chris Bowen.
Ms. Brendan O'Conner, who was in Sri Lanka, where he met with the authorities about the people he worked with, has implemented five overall changes, while the rest are still in question.
If the "validity" feature is chosen, a review of the game's request can be made about "Is the name true in situations in which a designated person, the owner of the game user, or the relative of a good person or personal companion".
Businesses may need to keep the number of 457 employees, because the first businessmen who wanted to use the minimum number of workers kept hundreds of people at work.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan escape agent died of a heart attack this week on Christmas Island.
The young man's uncle, who was nine years old, came to Australia to visit him. After his father's death, one of his older cousins, who was on the bridge, knocked on his feet.
The Australian authorities brought the person to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced a study for growth in Scotland's benefits from the HS2 Railway Project.
HS2 represents high-speed services in Scotland and northern England, which will start soon with the first move in 2026.
Mr. Bronez Kramer said the project would be "British one."
Foreign Minister Keith Brown of Scotland said they're very "responsive" working with the British government on this project.
The first step will include a new high-speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
When the second step is completed, the lines will be reached to Manchester and Leaders.
In June, the government reviewed the cost of creating high-speed links between London and North England and estimated £41.6 billion.
The British government, speaking to Scotland's move, instructed HS2 Limited to consider rail capacity and travel time and the potential to create better opportunities for North England and Scotland.
This includes three hours or less possible travel time from Glossogo and Edinburgh to London.
According to Barnes Kramer, "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that will bring the Yuke and its cities closer together."
We're moving forward with HS2, because it's going to be a lot more useful.
Instead, we will face problems related to the ability of our network.
But it's also about 18 British cities with glassgo and Edinburgh, which will be connected in a good way because of HS2.
Scottish's real lister Karmicel says: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmicel for a "explain" return from Scotland to the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "It is likely that Scotland will benefit greatly from high-speed rail, but this will increase the financial burden on Scotland throughout the UK.
So we are encouraged to work in the British government's share, so that we can examine options for bringing high-speed rails in Scotland, creating benefits for all and implementing the glass-Edinburg line, which the Scottish government has already planned.
I'm ready to review the investigation report with the British government's members next year and decide with the next action.
Air traffic regulations will now be effective in Australia
Despite the gentle action taken to calm the devices in the United States, the Australian Airways must continue to shut down their tablet and smartphone phone when they fly and fly.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the option of changing its operations to make it possible to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on its equipment, while they remain in the "Wayouian" mode.
Travelers can still do so during many flights, but it is not good to be able to access their e-books as they fly and fly.
Australian air services companies are considering this decision, which would suggest that US air service companies should do much more to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The civil aviation security extension also said that it was thinking about the declaration, but stressed that the use of scientific equipment is still underway in Australia.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations to control the use of nuclear equipment in the air," the extension said, "this is the end of the current regulations, which ensures that air service operations companies have always been fully regulated, and that passengers are required to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members."
Virginia, who is already talking to CASA about expanding its inflated wireless entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she said to work on the direction of Winjamk.
The manager said, "We'll welcome the review by CASA on the use of scientific equipment, because we really think it's going to give the players a better experience, because now we've got (Verles Inflight Entertainment) in our planes.
Quantas said it will now comply with the current rules.
He said, "It's not possible to use scientific equipment while flying and flying in accordance with our current law, and we have no immediate plan to change it."
FAA decisions are applicable to the U.S. Elerlins.
So, we're always engaged in creative developments that can benefit tourists, and we'll definitely think about the decision of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision, each US air service company will be different and will depend on the duration of their flight.
Air services companies may need to confirm that their mobile devices can tolerate radio processing, as well as to update them in detail their laws, training materials, the Carey-On-Bugage Program and travel.
FAO said, "After confirming the endurance of their flights by the Irish, it will allow the passengers to use their mobile devices at all altitudes, such as satellites, e-readers and smartphones."
In cases of low visibility, the driver's team will command to close its device while flying.
The group has also recommended that heavy equipment be placed safely under the seat or in the upper decks during flight and flight.
The Panbrokers’ money because of the heavy - shouldered heavy - shouldered heavy - shouldered heavy - shouldered heavy - shouldered task in Singapore
In Singapore, Jeannie Amirthlinga is offering her gold, jewelry and soup to celebrate her daughter's school Fiss at the Bendemeir Shopping Center in Ponshup.
Mrs. Amirthlinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought a house, so our money has been stolen."
They say, although they earn $3,000 as a minister, they also earn $2,000, and their husbands also work, but family monthly income is not enough.
In fact, there is the same demand in parts of South-East Asia - where the family is growing in the jungle - the Williamix where they are going to land this week became the third pandemic on Singapore Stock Exchange.
The expectation is not the only way to get the map - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of South America - but almost unprotected bank London as much as it is.
In general, the Panbroker spends 17 per cent a year in Singapore, which is slightly more than 15.4 per cent of those posted by the U.S. Overcrowding Bank, which is a local agency at the shopping center.
However, there is no need for credit check or VAT, and they can be made available more quickly than the bank.

Natural Thailand is concerned about the high levels of the user's hunger, which is rising slowly from this week's technology.
On Thursday, the data has been shown to be less than seven export goods and user requests.
The Malaysian Bank, in the U.S.A., said, "The basic point is that with increasing prices, those who come from [this] middle class will try to increase their income in a positive way."
In the past two years, historically high values in the values of gold have moved people to keep personal belongings, as they are benefiting from the chance to lose the values of their families.
In Singapore, 70 percent of the gold items stored in the 200-pound outlet of the City State are gold.
People say, "The dream is good. Let's go get the mother's glasses of gold, and they'll take it back in the next month.
Thailand's biggest Panshop driver, EGmani, has seen 20 percent of the total number of users using their own outlet in recent months.

325-million-dollar safety packages for Tage's health
The U.S. government stressed that the health system in Tasmania is also closely linked to a 325 million-dollar security package that would ensure that the government could not break the regime's law.
UN Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the National Assembly, the old population of the island state, the high level of germs, and the limits of the system are being "resisting" to solve the current crisis.
The ruling of the four-year marketing process was followed by a government review with the independent Sonsad Andrew Wilki of Tasmania.
Mr. Plyberseck said today, "the government has taken a package of self-defence, which we believe will solve the special challenges facing the Kingdom.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million alternative resource plan.
Additional 2600 operations, with the orthopaedic and Motiabint-Serger, will help to resolve previous complex issues.
In Hobart and Lanstation, it also includes money to start the personal electronic health archive system after leaving the hospital, training of medical professionals, mental health services and local hospitals.
Mr. Plyberseck said, "These investments are in the best way I've been told to improve the health system of Tasmania by former doctors."
The minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would face a strong reporting and replying government.
The Kingdom will have to maintain the current level of marketing for national wealth, and every month it will have to report where additional time is being spent.
Three members will be gathered to ensure that the service is provided in an efficient and efficient manner by the Kingdom.
Mr. Wilky said that the value of 325 million dollars would not be much longer, "until the public health system of Tasmania is not really improved to reach a more competitive level."
Still, they commended the government for responding to their call for immediate assistance, which they had brought before the prime minister at the beginning of May."
Mr. Wilki said, "I hope that the United Kingdom will be very helpful as a package to help the public health system separate from the list of disasters."
According to the Government, these additional optional processes will prejudge the recent events.
But the U.S. health user Peter Downton believes today's statement is "band-ad settlement."
They said to the U.S. TV, "We're here because the Liberian state government has brought 430 million dollars in its health system.
You can't think of taking about half a billion dollars from the government and giving 300 million dollars by the National Assembly as a good news day.
Mr. Dotton asked that Mr. Plyberseck should be awarded a loan that none of the rescue packages would be charged to the press.

A group of guards said that Syria had lost its ability to create a Soviet weapon
A group of Governors of Goruvar said that Syria has destroyed important equipment for the creation of Russian weapons and gas weapons, while a strong conflict in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the area where the designated agents are believed to be.
Also to Guwar, the Syrian Andolan group said that about three years ago, about 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the Syrian war.
This declaration of the Russian armed organization has been a day since the last date of November 1
The Heggist Organization has determined that Dmsks will destroy or "impact" the machine used to achieve Russian weapons production units and related gases and fill the war materials.
To complete the initial step of destruction, this major event is the stone of a mass mine that aims to destroy all the Russian weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of the device means Syria can no longer create a new Russian weapon.
However, Damascus must still destroy existing weapons and assembly.
It is believed that Syria now has 1000 mts of tons of gas and weapons, including Master Gas and the North Agent Serin.
The British state of Sirian Abgervetrie For Human Rights reported that this announcement occurred at the time Guruvar grew up in the city of Safira, where experts believe it is the Russian arms production unit and the assembly centre.
The Angolan group, who reported deaths from the Angolan network in Syria, told Goruwar that 120,296 people have died.
He said 6,365 children included 61,067 ordinary citizens.
The government has been told that 29,954 state officials are members of the army of Bashar Azad, 18,678 soldiers fighting in the government, and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah volunteers.
It also said there are 2,202 soldiers and about 5,375 refugees, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. claimed that about 100,000 people died in the March 2011 conflict.
It hasn't updated the data since.
As a result of this conflict, about 20 million people are forced to leave the country.
The army of Ashdod fought against the enemies of Sepharah many weeks, many of whom belonged to the El-Qaida tribes.
The Governor said that the two people were upset, but he didn't say anything clearly.
This war represents the threats faced by Russian weapons observers, who have a very short-term mission to end weapons in Syria during the war.
The U.S. D.B. Group, working with the United Nations, was told, "It is now satisfied and confirmed - and has seen all of Syria's declared major productions and Egyptian/distorting equipment - destroyed."
It also said, "No monitoring system plans were ever made."
At the beginning of this week, observers said they went to 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus and completed the first phase of the verification.
The observers said that they were not able to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Saturday, O.P.C.D.B. said that according to Syria, the two centres "are placed and... the Russian weapons productions placed there were brought to other declared centres, which have been monitored."
It was not immediately clear that the unit in Safiera, is either one of the two centers, where the O.P.C.D.B. monitors were not able to go.
Syria has proposed a plan for the complete destruction of its Russian weapons, which is to be approved by the operational system of the O.P.C.D. in the next month.
Uzomku, director general of the Group's ongoing comment by O.P.C.D., said, "I welcome the strength and enthusiasm you have shown by people to complete the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization."
For three years this village has been fighting mainly the government of Ashdod and its security forces, including Shia Islam, members of the Al-Qaida Party, and the conflict between the hostile Sunni Muslims.
In another incident, Rami Abdurrahman, head of Abziervetrie, said that the air defence centre in the Syrian territory of the region of Latvia had been severely damaged by the earthquake.

According to the police, Clark and Balber were taking out the papers from the records of the old lands and then buying new stamp paper and making online registers on them.
No, after that, they paid the real register to the registered register that was lost.
After that they sold the land into one thousand pieces of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
There, these waterpapers were carrying lions.
After that, the real owner of the land was in charge of the police and the government.
A special focus was on the areas of the AARIG that are preparing the web registers.
Because there's no one who's watching the ENIG's land.
So it's easy to sell these countries online registers.
Police Commissioner Gil told the lawyers in question that they have prepared online registers up to 150 so far.
According to the police, the group has already been involved in fraud and theft against the rest of the group.
Acrosis on the rights of the bomb blaster in Baal
In 2002, 202 people who were killed in a bomb attack and related, shouting at the bomb blaster's court that the dead bat should be facing the fire squad.
The batik, who had been separated from one of the most promising people in South-East Asia for almost 10 years, had been heard for almost 20 years to create a bomb explosive device used in the explosives.
He can be released in 15 years when he is given a parabola.
At 45 years of age, Umar was found guilty of a mass murder in two Nitclubs in the area of the famous U.S.A., where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many people were killed.
He was also found guilty of many other allegations relating to the subject, including the brutal bombing of a bomb in the church in Indonesia in the early summer of 2000 in the Middle Ages.
The organizers asked for a life sentence, although they could also demand that the person who was the master of the bomb maker be the death penalty of the person who was called the "man of law".
This decision restored the painful memories of a woman living in Pheta who had lost her 39-year-old daughter in death, who had been killed by a decade ago by her companions.
And they held their peace. And they said, The passover must be sacrificed.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other nice speakers.
Mr. Courtin told the U.S.
I live without my mother-in-law and my daughters every day.
On 12 October 2002, just after 11 p.m., it was destroyed after the bombing of the bomb that was loaded outside the club.
Peter Huguez was on the padded time when the explosives were released from the explosives by the armed forces in 20 seconds.
As a result of this bomb explosion, they went to a month-long coma and died three times while living on life-saving devices.
Mr. Huguez says that the park should have the same reputation, which had been found by the three other members of the Islamic People's Party - Amerigi, Mucals and Imam Sea - who had been sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person has to be given a death sentence before anyone else.
There is no need for you to keep him alive. See, there is no longer any reason for him to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and killing countless people, it's not enough to get 20 years of age.
Pattek is the last person to find satisfaction from the bomb explosions.
She was almost ten years away from arrest, but eventually in January 2011, she was arrested in Abtabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. Army had recently killed President Osama without Laden four months later.
During the trial, F.B.I.A.A. submitted evidence that the report found that South-East Asia had been in Pakistan for contact with Bill Laden in an attempt to re-establish relations between South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
Mr. Courteen says, "He didn't commit suicide."
Even today, it is not really the pain of suffering for so many people.
This decision, this year, came before the 10th anniversary of Amaleh, which will be marked by allies in Bali and Australia.
Mr. Courtin said, "This year will be very sad."
The hunter can still appeal against his fate.
F.A.: Air travel can now use the gateway in the air (but cannot call the cell phone)
From getting into the air travel gateway, it will be possible to read, work, play games, watch music, use your electronic device to listen to it - but you will not be able to talk to your cell phone - which is the basis for more and more sophisticated new guidelines by the common Ugandan administration.
But the passengers should not be waiting for these changes immediately.
At a news conference, U.S. President Michael Huarta said that the rapid implementation of these changes would be different in each network.
Eerlins will have to show the F.A. how their planes, their new guidelines, and how the training manuals of their crew members and the collection of devices are being updated to show the directions.
F.A. said it had already received plans from some Irish to expand the use of Portable Electronic Devices on the plane.
Delta and Zetbulu are among the Irish people who have already presented plans.
The U.S. said in a statement, "On the basis of the situation of the plan, we can accept the wide use of electronic devices very quickly.
Philhall needs to close your smartphone, tablet, and other devices when the passengers are closed by the airport.
They are expected to avoid arriving at 10,000 feet above the altitude of the plane and being allowed by the captain.
Travellers are expected to restart their device while they fly, and do not start it until the plane goes completely down.
The U.S. said that, under new guidelines, airlines that are fully protected by electronic equipment, can allow their passengers to fly by air, fly by flight, and use the device during taxiing.
Most of the new Irish companies and other flights that have been investigated that travel can use higher temperatures are expected to meet these requirements.
Director of the Association of Professional Fleet Attendent, Laura Glading has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When justice will be acted safely -- and we will work together with Irish companies -- it will be a victory for both birds."
When it comes to this, we've got a job, like "Hall Monitors".
Agensi said that, however, it would still be forbidden to connect the Internet at less than 10,000 feet above the height of the Internet, e-mail, e-mail, mail delivery, or receive or download data.
Travelers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablet and other devices in the aircraft mode.
There can still be no conversation with friends, such as online Scrabble, which is the famous event that when Ector Elek Baldwin was playing on his smartphone during the summer of 2011, when he was on the airport and refused to close the device by them.
And you'll still have to collect laptops, like heavy equipment, because they'll worry about losing someone else in Kabul.
The phone call will continue to be blocked during the flight.
The phone call's got the Vietnamese authorities at the federal press office, not the F.A.
Some electronic devices can be intercepted by F.A. while flying and moving.
Last month, Mark Roženkon of the National Security Council of the U.S. National Security Council, U.S.A.News, said the cell phone is still considered to be a threat.
Roženker said, "Celephones are really serious, but not because they can possibly generate disturbances in navigation-related devices, but also because they can generate disturbances in cell phones when they're in the air.
In order to check this point, the U.S. World Research Institute, published by the U.S., concluded last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on the F.A. has increased in recent years to reduce their use.
Mr. Claire McKallick, like a D-mo, said there's no valid security reason for honesty.
It is still difficult to start these obstacles because the device is the most usable.
Some studies also suggest that about three thirds of passengers forget or ignore the instructions for closing their device.
F.A. began to ban the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996, when the passengers received reports of the arrival of F.M. radio and high-level passengers in navigation and news equipment at the time.
New Airlines companies are more dependent on the electrical system compared to the previous generation of flights, but they have also been designed and approved to resist the F.A.'s electronic signature.
Airlines have been using air-failing for many years by tourists.
The planes that have been tested for the W-Fi system are also more resistant to the processing process.
Huerta said most Irish companies need to pass on licenses for more use of electronic devices under the new directive.
Today's electronic device, compared to the electronic device of the past generation, generates much less power than the radio transmission of power.
For example, when an email reader returns a page, a single name is used for transmission.
But the transmission is strong when you download or send data from the device.
Amazon.com is also among those who take precautions to reduce the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011 the company authorities loaded their entire central e-readers in the Airlines and launched them to test the problems, but no such problems were encountered.
The F.A. Advisor team on the use of the device has voiced negative feelings.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Travel Association said that they believe that the practice of the device is real, even if it's just a name.
Other members of the community said that only the reports described by pilots, most of which are very old, are supported by the device's handling in the Aercroft System.
And yet, members of the community insisted that the F.A. Pilot be allowed to command the passengers to close the device when the planes are down in sight.
The travel group has welcomed the changes and has a general knowledge of the people who travel in the most recent period of their history.
The U.S. T.S. T.O.R. D. said we are pleased to know that F.A. is not inconsistency with travel, protection and security.
The U.S. police, learning from the bomb attacks in the apartment, took a room for the Quebec Reaction in the meantime.
In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the legislation, to prevent the spread of superstitions, to prevent the spread of other ideas and to teach others about the consequences, all 1800 cities will be packed with cars and vehicles on all the main sites of the city, masseuses and other places.
Among these young people, there will be women's police officers with PICAR, Traffic Unit.
The city's hotels, guesthouses and PJs will also check records from police workers and commando authorities.
Tana SCHO has been instructed to collect a special investment team (SIT) for handling matters.
Also assigned to the DSP with the aim of checking on Markets, Mol and other locations with the VIP sectors in the city.
In the wake of the independence situation and the crisis, the authorities have also determined the duty of police officers in the federal police control of the people.
The police were told to keep air alerts from the staff of the DMS and other dissidents, except for the Department-16, GMS and DHS, as well as from the PGI's director, prime director, and DHS.
In order to teach the minds, the regional authorities have now put others, along with women's police officers, into the leadership of ENJO, calling 'Inte Gonda Staff' on duty.
The police officers of the Andy Gunda Staff Team will sit in groups with the guards in plain clothes and hold their minds.
All ESCOs have been ordered to hold 44 babies in the inner islands of the city.
Police workers will also be present at 38 Nana points on the city borders.
The bird was left in the wilderness by air movement for safety from the North C Reg.
The bird found on the North C Oil Ridge has been abandoned by air currents back into the forest.
This half-line bird was sent by the former helicopter to the rescue center of their Elua by Scottish SPCA.
The central manager Colin Sedden said: "This is a railway that is probably a ski resort in northern Europe, which came at the speed of the North Sea."
It seems that the bird was tired and he escaped on the oil rig.
They said, “He was unable to flee, so we were contacted for help.”
Before leaving, half of the railways had been healthy and comfortable.
Is Europe’s High Class ready to deal with Britain?
In April, Bigens For Britain was launched and was promised to bring the business together and to determine what changes the U.S. developers would like to see in our relationship with the founder of the U.S.
To him, we asked him what they thought about British business with the U.S., when organizing the largest and most extensive tour of British business leaders.
U-Gove has given the opinion of 1,000 business leaders, who represent Britain's business size, regions of these places.
The results of this survey may be surprising to many people.
We found that a large part of the workers want to export out of Europe now, and focus on those countries that are becoming and growing today, while the U.S. member countries are getting out of hand.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries such as China, India, and Brazil, not to the long-term and poor process of reforming the U.S. secret institutions.
When asked about specific rights areas, such as the law of production, from a single mandate, most business leaders believed that these decision-makers should return to Westminster.
We could easily see our discontent with the single market, saying that the cost of the sale of Brussels is much more than the profit of the business sector in Europe - up to 40 percent of the businessmen who were primarily the guardians of European companies were in favour of this.
Finally, and most clearly, our surveillance of business leaders found that a large part clearly wants to move forward on trade-based trade-based and medium-sized change rather than with the US.
This argument, which was seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are moving towards a "serious change" that will give the U.K. its lost power back.
It has a high cost - the average change for Britain and the goal of getting a better income in non-sounds has changed by 16 percent in the United States.
The prime minister should not be in any doubt: it is obvious that British businessmen support their plans to report to Britain's membership in the U.S.
It has also shown that business, current power balance is expected to be renewed by making a major change to the U.K.
It is possible for British businesses to have a better reward, and it is getting too fast, because the Eurozone, the sense of state and the political union are moving forward.
Priority should be given to innovations and growth in Britain, as our observation shows that this means a new focus on business and a fundamental change in the internal functioning of Brazil.
Elec Miller of the Gaza Strip started a new era in Bulgaria
The head of the Gazprom said that the beginning of the South Stream Gas Pipeline concentration in Bulgaria marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today there has been a historic event: the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Alex Miller of Gazprom in a statement to Guwar.
This project is a major element of European capital security.
South Stream will provide diversity in Russian export routes in Europe.
The authorities said that Ukraine, where most Russian gas is part of Europe, presents a key element of a dialogue between the Contrapartment of the Gaza Strip and the Gazprom.
Miller said that a member of the European Union meant a direct connection to Bulgaria, to end the "sacrifice" of the geopolitical communities connected with the countries of the past.
After the whole project began in 2015, Bulgaria's Gluhak will receive gas at the levels that are left out of the South Stream.
Gazprom said that until the end of the year, the concentration in other countries should begin.
This pipeline has been designed for the annual capacity of the 2.2 Trillian-Trell-Fate Nachural Gas.

Before the attacks against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission heard a complaint from two W.M.C. workers.
In 2011, before the arrest of Coringbah Bal, a lawyer named Jonathan Lord, was charged with the crime of Bal-Yon, two of the workers of the W.M.S.S.D.B.
But in his speech to Iogo, he said, "It's never been the case with Bale John in his organization," he was told.
The chief executive officer Philippe was asked every time about the matter, in which a W.M.S. employee was charged with the Bale Pornography Crimes, and another case where the B.M.C.A. Kim Kim was charged with the crime against the children he was caring for in 1991.
And the chief captain of the guard gave me a bill of divorcement, and said unto me, Ye know not what ye ought to do, but what ye should do.
They also admitted that the fact that the W.M.S.'s claim to "has been verified outside the W.M.S. and that they have found W.M.C.'s best in the matter of security" is not true.
In contrast to Iogo, it was reported to the W.M.C., and it received the second lowest rating in the education and social quality audit in August this year.
M. Every one who has been connected to the W.M.C. for 21 years has admitted that the "self with me" system has failed to make sure that workers are clearly aware of their concerns regarding reporting the violation of the law of the State of security.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was held guilty of crimes with 12 children during the two years of work in the U.S., along with 12 children.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
But Mr. Harre rejected the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the W.M.S., which the workers did not inform of the ball security breach by Lord.
The workers gave the Witnesses what they saw about the violation, including spending time alone with the children by the Lord, making them homeless, sitting in the garden, telling them that he loves them, and that he has to give them to play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was in charge of the Lord, and had something to do with ball security training, because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the Watcher of the Lord, the W.M.C.A. Caringbah Service provider, was "hard to find a lot of warning and time."
The U.S. said he didn't accept the witness of the workers that they were not easy to provide information to his employer.
He said, their friend and Lord had lost their decision to inform him about him.
Mr. Harre said they had given the W.M.C.N.S.D.D.M.M.M.M.D.M.M.M.M.M.D.M.M.M.D.M.M.M.M.D.M.M.M.M.D.M.M.M.D.M.M.M.M.M.D.M.M.M.D.M.D.M.M.M.D.M.M.M.D.M.M.M. had a view that the text "noting of information" was "noting" for the organization.
Mr. Harre said that the decision to sign a secret agreement by the workers immediately after the attack was made was made by Liam Witley, the Federal Minister of State of the United States.
They said that it was intended to protect from the threat of the witness, but it was not carried out "inspired" and correctly.
Professor Stephen Smalbon, Special Professor of the University of Griffith University, said that there was no secure organization in the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011.
They said that workers' appointments, monitoring, access, training and monitoring were "the major problems".
The hearing has been suspended until 20 December.
Blair says they want the British back.
Tony Blair said they'd want the opportunity to be the president of Britain again -- but they don't think it's possible to return.
The 59-year-old Blairer expressed his opinion on various household issues in a witness delivered by the chief executive office on the occasion of their fifth anniversary of their graduation.
After a decade of absence as a leader in June 2007, Mr. Blair, with his majority of comments limited to his role as representatives of foreign affairs and the Middle East peacekeepers, was quite reluctant to discuss the British government.
When asked whether they would like to return to the presidential term, Mr. Blair was introduced by the London Evening Standard newspaper, saying: "Yes, of course, but it is not possible to do so, so..."
They asked the leaders not to leave the business community behind after the financial crisis.
They knew that this would be a challenging response when a group of horse-showers gathered in Cardiff for the top horses of the year.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Prince Kirkland.
They are not yet in school, and a few months away from taking their first step, this young man and his own native country's tutu tafie have been very easy to perform three steps and have received the top approval - he has left his 30-year-old opponent behind.
In the annual response organized by the Equestrian Center in the vicinity of the Cardiff, a couple who could not be separated -- which is a long-term ski — were greatly commended for the appearance, behavior and style of the scene.
In front of the famous Baller Hat, the men and women, he threw his hat on Alhad and started his two-year-old Tofie in the ring.
The decisionors praised Fontan for his natural ability to control, which is much older than his age.
And tofie got the best score for his appearance and personality.
Fontan was given as a gift on his third birthday in March, and he has since studied with this Tutu in the Pacific.
His 30-year-old mother, Dona, said, "Fentan and Tofi are a wonderful couple."
They had to face the challenge of all expectations, but they both lived with gold roofs and rockets.
It was the second time, when he was involved in a conflict with Tofie, and we were all very happy with his victory.
And the most outstanding thing in the color world was that they were all so impressed that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This little boy in South Wales, near Nanteglo Gonave, is following the signs of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, "The whole place was full of excitement, everyone was happy and happy."
He was running on a full-colored ball, and even though he seemed so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fonton is a bird's nest - he loves horses, tractors and field, and he's got two legs that he's looking for.
As he started, he'll be in the biggest horse show of the year, and I'm sure he'll show it very well.
The owner of the annual horse show said, "Fenton's life is only three years old, but he's got to control his totto."
They're very good friends.
The decision-makers gave the score to see their presentation in the way they showed Fonton and Tofie.
They saw a good team work between Tottu and his car - in this case were the biggest in Fonton and Tofie rowing.
I am confident that the love of Fontan helped him, that he was really very different.
The data supplied by the Chinese newspaper will be "serious"
A Chinese newspaper that had an appeal on the front page to leave a reporter responsible for the incident will be saved, said a Press Winjam.
The news of Guangzhou's New Express has given a public record for the release of a journalist from Cheongju.
But after that, Mr. Chen agreed on television that they had agreed to write the following news about the State's subsidiary.
Winjamak said that the new expression should now be replaced with "complete improvement".
The order from the Hong Kong Press has come from the publication, radio, film and television management.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangching Ewing News Group had published a lot of lies about listed company Zumloin from September 2012 to August 2013.
Winjamak said in a statement, "The editor of the New Express was not available."
It said it had decided "to cancel a administrative sentence by canceling the license of the rapporteur in Cheongju."
"It instructed the Young Evening News Group to make a complete improvement in the New Express, to examine the responsible people and to promptly review the lead group of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in the New Express about financial irregularities in a concentration-up company called Jumloyan.
After they were released, their newspaper published two headlines for their release, saying that it supports Egypt's China press.
But after that, M. Chen came to the Kingdom television, and he agreed to write and publish false stories for money.
They told the C.C.T.V. that "in this case, I have given Jumloin and all the news along with the media, as well as the ability to win the faith of the people."
I did so mainly because I was rich with money and fame.
I've become aware of my mistakes.
After M. Chen's pardon, the New Express continued a major apology, stating that it had failed to verify their report correctly.

The scientists have also shed light on the relationship between the question of the dog and its mouth.
Recent studies have found that the fun dogs push their nests to the right (from the right) while the dogs push their prey primarily to the left.
But now scientists say that partners can identify and express their reaction to this specific chapter of the poll.
This study has been published in the General Court Biology.
From the University of Trent, neurosynthesis professor Georgia Wellertigara said: "People know all of this well that the left and right parts are involved in a variety of strains that generate positive or negative feelings."
Here we have tried to see it in other nations.
They said that they were responsible for all the work of the hands of every man, and for all that was done by them in the house of their fathers, and that they did according to the number of the names of the men; and they were divided into two parts.
In order to learn more about how dogs react once and for all by other cats, researchers have looked at animals looking at the consequences of other cats.
And they washed the inward parts of the bulls of their hearts, and did examine the conduct of them.
We probably don't have much time to figure out why they're never going to the other side.
Professor Vallertigra said, "We showed the boxes with the pictures of the boxes -- in the original version or in the shadow picture, and we could see all the questions and present the question with more left or right."
And when the living creatures saw the flying creature, they were glad, and were afraid, and turned their backs to the earth, and saw every flying creature that was moving upon the earth, and every living creature that was moving upon the earth, and every flying creature that was moving upon the earth, and every flying creature that was moving upon the earth, and every living creature that was moving upon the earth, and every living creature that was moving upon the earth, and every flying creature that was moving upon the earth, and every flying creature that was moving upon the earth, and every flying creature that was moving upon the earth, and every flying creature that was moving upon the earth, and every living creature had every living creature which had seen the things that was made unto him, and every living creature had the spirit of angels, and every living creature that had the spirit of every living creature that had been made for an image that had not made unto him.
But when they saw them turning to the right and to the left, their hearts became hardened, and they were heedless.
According to Professor Wallertigra, they don't think the dogs were talking to each other, knowing through them all.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and not who they should be.
They said, “If you have been given the like of the cattle, and if they are moving towards a place of worship, it is related to more friendship, and the right party is less than the right one, you respond on the basis of experience.”
Investigators say they can provide independent owners, animal doctors and teachers with better information on animal emotions.
According to Philo of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol School, specialist John Bradsey of Dogs has said that it is not the first study to check whether the left or the right part is important for cats.
Last year the University of Link team found that when dogs see a terrible dog, they turn their heads to their left and turn to their right when they see a happy dog.
In another survey of the University of Victoria in Canada, they said: "In contrast to the Italian study -- when robotic dogs were moved to the left, it was more likely that they would be sold than they were."
They said, "This is because dogs and dogs don't fully understand animals or robotic cats in various studies."
They explained that it could help study how to respond to actual cats by dogs.
"Since there are enough evidence from various columns that the two parts of the screen are used for different purposes, more information is still available - and there are no quotas in this matter," they said.
Although, the easy way to slow down their behavior seems to see that we don't have much time to understand why they're ever going to turn to each other.
Because of Alex Turner’s disease, Arctic manikize stopped glassgo gig
The Rock Bank, called the Arctic Mechanical Bank, stopped Gig in Glosgo after his main song had been played by the band.
The program of the Sheffield group was scheduled to show in the city on the Hydro site in February.
But their main singer Alex Turner's disease has forced them to redefined the date of this fall.
The band's announcement came at the time when they were obliged to stop Gig in the LG Erina in Burmingham in the same way.
In his official website, the Arctic Monkiz said that after taking the medical advice, after the night's end in LG Erina, the Arctic may have to stop Shoe on Saturday, November 1, also on Glosgo Hydro.
"Alex Turner has been hit by lightning, and they're not in pain to show."

Pop French February will announce the name of the first Cardinal
The Vatican announced that on February 22 Pope Francis would create a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his work.
Cardinals, the Catholic Church has the clergy of the highest class, their terms are just below the pope, and these people choose the pope, so France will establish the first group of its own, which will eventually help their representatives to choose.
Now there's 201 cardinals in there.
Well, after 80 years of age, Cardinal won't be allowed to participate in the pope's election -- they come into a group of 120 "Cardinal electors".
In a press release, Vatican user Fedrico Lombard said that before the new Cardinals were introduced, the meetings of all present Cardinals, which are said to be the pop-up meetings, will be organized.
Lombardi said, "Pop France has decided to state its decision to organize the February pop-exploration, so that it would be easier to plan other meetings of Cardinals from different countries of the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said it was possible to reduce the number of cardinal voters by February.
He said that Pope generally, the number of Cardinal electors is as low as 120, including Cardinals, and those over 80 years of age, according to their will.
Valero said, "The pop-up meeting next year will be important, because this year will be the first pop-up meeting after France was chosen in March.
There is a kind of precedent for Italy in Europe and in particular at present.
They said, "It's hard to see if the new popes, even from the rest of the world, design Cardinals.
Ninety percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but their number is very low in Cardinals.
The cardinals - which is a group of eight cardinals from around the world, who are looking for a reform of the Church, will also be the first cardinals to be elected after they have been collected.
In the past, Pope had decided everything by himself.
Valero said, "Now France has chosen these eight cardinals to help."
They said that "probably" would ask for advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we're not in this situation - it's really new.
Valero said that Popes generally call the Bishops of the great places Cardinal, but Frances "were completely surprised - so we don't know which name they're going to pronounce."
To correct the setback, G.M. called back the pickup tracks in the U.S.
According to a report by U.S. Auto Security Winyams, the General Motors Company has called for nearly 19,000 tracks to be returned to repair a drop in its hand-turned seat in September 2014 and in the G.M.C.P.P.P.P.Trakes.
Some tracks may be less than one in the printable system.
As a result, it failed to comply with the United Auto Security Standards on Head Restraint.
According to an information posted on the website of the National Road Security Administration, "if the train is turned off, it is possible that head-restriction cannot be protected in the right way by the driver, which will increase the risk of injury".
Calling back, Models was created between 1 August and 10 September.
This is the most important Vahan Launch for U.S. Automeker after the 2009 update of the G.M. truck.
G.M. had told the truck owners about this mistake in the north of October.
The 16-day government ban on UNTMA, which had imposed an increase in Auto's bill in October, was unable to review the owner's notification letter.
G.M. said in February, Silverdo and Sira trucks that were redesigned for the 2014 Model Year were 20 per cent older than in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, G.M. sold 42,660 silverwoods and 16,503 silver pickup trucks.
In the New York Stock Exchange in February, there were 1.4 percent in the G.M. branch.
The Controversy of Obama’s Inquiry
I won't let Obama do twice before I change
They say that Obama's great efforts have been made because of the G.O.P.'s rebellion.
Obstacle rule can't solve the problems of the Obamateer website, drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memorabilia reminds us of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris Harvard is a second year in medical school.
I'm reading very sad books today.
It's a book that I think will encourage me during the second year of medical school and give me hope.
Its name is "The Force of Gita," and it is the 2008 National Election of Obama.
When I wake up at night and go to bed, this book is taken to me in a moment where the government has inspired millions of people, and speech can prevent your health.
The election was confirmed, and reporters had stopped showing the historical significance of that time.
My friends were happy in the eyes of my friends, and my parents kept the record of all who came in.
A group of young foreigners were going to White House, ready to change the whole country.
In 2008, they had 82 per cent permit rating during Obama's reign.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a terrible truth, like returning from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope -- they seem to be a long memory, a painful memory of lost events.
The first time I did this, I actually changed my mind.
It's easy to say that I couldn't think of any of it.
I give Obama a lot of resources, take the Afordable Cairo Act and return our army from Iraq, "Don't ask," and kill Osama without the Laden.
In addition, I believe that the right to oppose immigration has prevented many efforts to increase in our country: there are public options for immigration, health services, to close the border on Guantanamo Bay, except for others.
But the many times in which I take care of my fellow workers, and the Obama government, I have the answer that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The opposition of the Republican right is not the answer of foreign leaders, nor is the answer of drone attacks against children in foreigners.
The National Security Agency cannot answer the collection of data on the private lives of American citizens, nor can it respond to attacks by government leaders on all kinds of people.
This cannot be explained by the U.S. civilian universal El Avalaki's murder without a tricycle, nor by the public authorities and the civil and criminal boundaries that were lower during the campaign.
It can't answer the results of the report, which says that Witthouse's attempt to hide the media "are still the most bitter after Nixon's administration."
And most recently, even after three years of signing the Afordable Key Act, it cannot fail to design a simple website.
I don't know if I expected it.
If, at 18 years of age, I should have assumed that the government system could break down the forward political agency.
It is clear that the independent office is not an early way, because opposition political groups and memorial events, such as Newton's murder, will shape our public debate.
Still, as I have mentioned above, they appear mostly elected by the government.
That's what bothers you most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was disappointed with her hope.
Mitt Romani presented a creative and uncertain option, which did not seem to determine their terms or their terms.
I thought that Obama's second task, which would be free from the choices of the future, would fill the hopes we've been hearing about for a long time.
However, since Obama's license rating is less than 45 per cent this week, it has become very difficult to get back in 2008.
When I see him, I remember his promises.
This week, a section of the book was reading, which described how the phenomenon in the Pennsylvania Primeria caused great damage to Clinton because of Obama.
In a post-Martm campaign meeting, they told their humble workers that they needed to return to their homeland, and that they needed to remain loyal to their goals.
They said, "I want to get my shirt back."
We should remember who we are.'
I can't agree more with you five years later.
The ideas expressed in this comment are from the Nathaniel Morris.

RBS suspended two Forex Traces
The Royal Bank of Scotland has commissioned two thirds of its foreign currency exchange shares, the fact that two experts have received this information from the case is another indication that the global interest rate in the monetary market is rising from the global interest rate by the Chinese.
The largest banks in the world, including U.S. Barclay, Dush Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that the world's largest financial market in which $5.3 Trillian donations are available daily, they are co-operated in the check-to-reading room with the filmmakers.
These two traders will be the first workers of the RBS, who have been banned from furthering the investigation-reading of the cases that appear to occur in the Libor Interbank and Herfer Cand.
The bank refused to comment on the Taliban, confirming that the bank had access to information from the filmmakers this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "We've been investigating this, and we're fully cooperating with FCA and other filmmakers."
Last month, experts on the subject said that RBS has sent to the former Treader and received e-mails and fast messages to the UK cinematic, financial and financial expansion.

The bank is searching for an error of several years in search of an e-mail message.
The report on research-reading has given rise to a number of areas' trades, which have been among the most profitable of the most profitable members of the trading of investment banks in the past few years, but they have to face this year's challenge, because there has been a decrease in the number of cases for investors due to the lack of transmission.
Some banks have tried to press the case, saying that it's very wide and extremely popular to transfer into the foreign currency exchange market, but the Prime Traders says it doesn't have to be true.
The Great Trader said that despite the vast size of foreign currency-progression, the increased use of its own platform is that "they can begin to influence the market on less-ticked values."
The news came on the same day that credit Switzerland announced that the trader would be served this week from its Exchange Trust Disc in London, which had damaged about $6 million by the end of the last year.
The bank has immediately announced beautiful enlargements and is contributing to its filmmakers.
Credit Suez said, "We believe that the trader has worked alone, and has been controlled."

The Supreme Court supported Obama’s health service law
As a major victory for Obama's administration, the U.S. Supreme Court has announced the health service law on behalf of Obama today.
Between 5 and 4 years the judges decided that the State's primary order for health protection and care - which would require citizens to buy or punish health diseases prior to 2014 - was the ultimate measure of the power to oppose the government.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other members of the court, while other judges, Scoalia, Toss, Elito, and Kennedy, failed.
The judge has also supported the rest of the 2700 pages of this law, saying that health services are required to grow in the state medicine industry or that they will all give a witness to medical care, which is not unusual.
The document was taken by 26 states and by the National Free Trade Agency to prevent this law.
During the initial session of 2012, the law was rejected by all the main republican nationalists, including the project-named persons, including the Roma.

Moving forward from fields, rivers, and forests to provide clean medical care
Dr. Georges Walle, in Cameroon’s rural areas, receives endless health services
Vale and her team see hundreds of diseases every week
In West Africa, there are few doctors; only 5,000 people have one doctor
Place your wager or deal a hand
Dr. Georges Wall is one of the top 10 N.N.N.s in 2013.
You can break for them or for someone else in chapter 10 to make the U.N. year rule.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his incompetence.
For 21 years, George Wall had seen his sick father come to his senses and be angry, going to the hospital, which was not adequately qualified to help him.
Jamel Well, in 1981, was in a car crash near Cameroon's capital city, Yonde.
At first, they only had to hold their hands, but there was an increase in the movement that spread to their brains, and he made a blood transfusion, which affected their rest of their lives.
Georges Wall says, "There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would have brought our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Vale took her father and had a lot of clinics and hospitals and got whatever they could get.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5:00 in the morning, hoping you'll be the first person to get to the hospital, but that's not the case.
There's a lot of diseases there.
Some can wait, waiting, to die.
In 2002, after the death of Wall's father, there was little change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, every 5,000 people in Cameroon has only one doctor.
In comparison, in the United States there is a medical doctor for every 413 people.
And even if there are doctors there, many of Cameroon's residents cannot afford it.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country, and about two thirds of the work in the field of health.
Well, they say, "The only problem they have is poor."
And because of the poor, they shall not be able to give their life for the sake of the poor.
And when he saw the affliction of his father, and his people, he was moved with compassion for them, and he began to comfort them.
Dr. Georges and his team of self-sustainers have been infected with 700 incurable diseases last year.
They also became doctors themselves, and began working as a Vascular Creator in the center of the United States Hospital.
And they started unprofitable escuvim, which goes to gravitational fields for weeks to provide unskilled medical services.
Since 2008, he and his own group have helped some 32,000 people.
Almost every Wednesday they and about 30 people sit in the living room, bind the medical facilities from the bed, and go to burial places where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes the variety wasn't with them.
They have to go up into the midst of the rivers and the valleys more than a thousand times.
But when they are come, there is in the midst of them an exceeding high priest, and in the court of the high priest, which is called Jesus, which was ordained of God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices.
In these caves there is a real cause of anxiety, and Val - with its great muscan and endless energy - are included in it with joy and joy.
The next morning their team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We're meeting 500 people on every trip."
They're about 60 miles from the cave, and they're coming down.
These provide clinical care for various types of treatment every week.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, methoma, Prophylaxis, and John.
Others may receive a gifted, gifted, or unsolicited birth certificate -- the need for this document appears in school, but many wealthy families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team can easily heal with local awareness.
The operation usually takes place at school's house, ton hall, or home; after the process, the disease goes to the place where it is rehabilitated, and makes room for the next person.
The group's general operator publishes both syndicated devices in the operating room, and the Wall and their volunteers work on their own Sunday mornings.
It's a slow pace, but the musicians of the cave usually help keep the team moving.
He said, "They've been playing games all night to keep us alive and keep us busy."
Their company returns to the city on the Sabbath day. They are weary, but they are proud of their work.
This group - which includes Cameroon's medical and foreign medical students - has been infected with 700 illicit drugs last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those who help.
One person said that he would be able to go to work again because of an unspoiled hernia health cure.
The man said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to working as a nurse at the hospital for weeks, they also work in private medical clinics around the corner of Yonde.
They said it's their second job that sells 60% of their unemployment; the rest is done with private donations.
In the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia, a medical student and a self-sustained group in the Valley, Katie O'Malley said, "I don't know when they're asleep."
They're always at the hospital, or they're trying to make a lot of money for their organization, to keep them going.
It is a useful opportunity for students from United States and Europe, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join the Wall, which they can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "In health care, we help to get Dr. Wall tools or clear blood vessels, in which we are able to get useful experience."
You will never have the opportunity to do so as a second-year medical student in the United States.
Self-study students usually work with them to get out of the camera, and often they come with the medical services of the gift.
But after they have arrived, they shall take up the sum of the money of their journeys, and of their journeys.
O'Malley says, "There's no doubt they're heroes."
They give their lives to this organization, and their desire to help the Cameroonians will never be fulfilled.
For Wall, almost one kind of job, it's not hard.
To help others live a happy life, and to fulfill the promise made to our Father. These are the things that bring great joy to them.
They say, "I'm very happy when I do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to treat people, to reduce their pain.
