A rapidly increasing rate of COVID-19 in the European Union and in Britain from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronary infection (COVID-19) has a similar trend in the countries of the Euro-EU/European Economic Area and Great Britain, thus confirming that, despite the various stages of its development in various countries, COVID-19 pandemics are growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, the countries, hospitals and intensive care offices, it is necessary to increase the level of readiness to influence patients with COVID-19, which will require treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were identified in the province of Hobbey.
On 9 January 2020, the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the infection inducer is a new type of corn virus known as a serious type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been known as COVID-19.
According to today's available data, approximately 80 per cent of COVID-19 people are infected in a light form, i.e. in the form of respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, while most patients suffer from it.
About 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develops in a more severe form with the need for hospitalization and in the rest 6 per cent accept a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients treated with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes the trends of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (ECE) and Great Britain and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hobbey.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 disease in the EU/ECE and in Britain with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and Great Britain
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and currently, in the rest of the world, COVID-19 pandemic has developed according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Eurosurvellance Journal of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiter (Spiter) and his colleagues reported first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe, which met the WHO's criteria for the existence of diseases.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/ECE were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of which had been returned from the Chinese province of Hobbey.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 infection have been identified in all 30 EU/ECE countries and in Great Britain, with 39 768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths, including 1,441 deaths, from 31 December 2019 to that date.
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative disease COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates at 8:00 a.m. data on the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the EU/ECE and in Britain and to compare the trends of COVID-19 in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases, COVID-19 has been calculated to reduce the cumulative disease of COVID-19 for 14 days, taking into account the normal duration of COVID-19 in each EU/ECE country and Great Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in EU/ECE countries and Great Britain
The trends in COVID-19 for the 14-day period in the EU/ECE countries and Great Britain were generally consistent with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hobbey (see para. 1).
The cumulative disease of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and Great Britain began to grow around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 a rare drop of this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of registered cases of disease in Italy, but similar trends were observed in all other EU/ECE countries and in Britain as a result of the increase in COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 disease in the EU/ECE countries and in Britain compared with the same indicator for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered at 8:00 a.m. in 15 other EU/ECE countries and Great Britain is estimated at approximately 3 weeks earlier in Italy.
Our results indicate the rapid increase in the number of cases registered in the EU/ECE and in Britain.
The observed trends in cumulative disease COVID-19 suggest that pandemics develop at a relative rate in all countries.
Despite this at various stages in various countries, different responses from national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for recognition of cases of disease and different patient selection rules for the analysis of the existence of COVID-19, including "inverse" testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients were required for intensive therapy, while SMEs noted that hospitals and intensive treatment offices in these regions had already been completed.
Currently, there are only 6 % and 1 % of patients with COVID-19 in the hospital and/or EU/ECA intensive therapy offices, respectively.
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such information in order to supplement the current monitoring data, the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant breakdown in the number of cases in intensive care and intensive care offices in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care offices for the 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 risk-assessment assessment shows the modelling of health systems load with estimated COVID-19 hospitalization data in each EU/ECE country and in Britain where the risk of lack of access to the COODs in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
Since at this time cases are grouped across certain regions of the EU/ECE and Great Britain, hospitals and intensive therapy services usually serve the population of a specific territorial group, information on the cases of infection and the number of cases in intensive therapy offices is recommended to provide the territorial units ' nomenclature for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/ECE and Great Britain.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy should be prepared to schedule SARS-CoV-2, which is not satisfactory for the long-term period, and to increase the number of patients with COVID-19 who need medical assistance and, in particular, intensive therapy, which can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the ECDC's latest report on the outcome of the risk assessment, the critical importance of preventing SARS-COV-2 has an operational, preventive and integrated approach with a follow-up to the reduction of effects, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases in decision-making people and hospitals, it may simply not be time to think, adopt and adjust their responses in a timely manner if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the outcome of the risk assessment also lists measures in the field of public health to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a limited period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the load on their health systems.
If this is not done, the EU/ECE health system will be affected by patients who will need intensive therapy in the next few days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronary infection in 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a serious severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a human tragedy: at this time in China and other countries of the world, more than 3,000 people have been killed and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Similar to SARS-CoV, which has caused the development of a severe respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from lactating mice and produces similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
COVID-19, however, differs from a lower level of disease and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more infected and affects older people than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of new diseases publications in this article, an ongoing and comprehensive review of the expeditious subject of research is proposed.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, viruses, diagnostics, treatments, projections of further flow and prevention of this disease.
Although answers to many questions are still to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the threat of illness.
A news release (China New Year) that was burned on 25 January 2020 was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people who had urged the outbreak of a new viral infection to stay home for the whole holiday and for many weeks after that.
In view of the high level of coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) referred to this virus as SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the related disease as Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Ohan and spread rapidly throughout the country, and then nearly 50 other countries of the world.
According to data dated 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified and more than 40,000 patients have recovered and more than 3,000 have been completed.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a “high number for society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nj.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months, including articles on its virus, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the follow-up of a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to combine the results of studies in the new and rapidly developing area.
As far as possible, we are trying to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other cancer-producing cancer virus, the cancer virus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We are also discussing the facts of prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some other issues that are not less pressing at the moment.
Coronaviruses were traditionally associated with the number of pathogens that were not fatally dangerous to humans and mainly caused about 15 per cent of total respiratory diseases 4.
However, in this century, we have been dealing with highly pathogenic human cancers, with a serious severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and a chronic respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of diseases that occurred in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively and were soon spread to many other States with a terrible level of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in human history.
As shown in Res. 1.1, a report on the incidences of unknown origin had first been made to the National Committee of Health of the CND on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
The first death occurred on 15 January 2020 in Mr. Ohanh.
In those days, the epidemic was rapidly spreading in neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was known that workers had been infected, allowing for the possibility of transmission of the virus from human beings.
On 23 January, Hughan was introduced into quarantine and stopped the work of urban public transport.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the marine product market in Hahan, which was considered to be the starting point of spreading the infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of cancer virus was a global emergency in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of the report, disease spread throughout China and has already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (see Figure 2.2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final level and the level of risk of shock are still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated map of the epidemic development (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHXa1qHA2bbudA).
The infection of SARS-CoV-2 was affected by all age groups, but mainly by people between 30 and 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, a total of only 20 years of age and only 14 of those infected were not yet 10 years old.
Infection of SARS-CoV-2 among men above (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was mainly distributed by the classics in the province of Hobbey and in nearby regions.
The diagnosis was 5 (2-9) days from the time the symptoms of COVID-19 occurred.
The incubation period was on average 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2).
From the time the symptoms of death occurred, 9.5 (4.8-13) days passed.
The basic product indicator (R0) was 3,77 (95% CI: 3,51–4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2,23–4.82.
As of 23 January 2020, there has been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons who, in time, coincided with the mass transport of the Chinese New Year celebration.
The mortality of patients with confirmed diagnosis was 144% (95% CI: 1.10– 1.86%), while the adjusted mortality rate in patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors in the event of COVID-19 injury were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of major ophthalmic viruses that contain either one or more special RNAs.
They can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma and deltas, from which alpha and beta-coron virus, as well as people, is said to be infected.
In the event of damage to the SARS and METS glucoprotein of opioid growth (S), the cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin-transverting plant (ACE2) and diptideil peptidase-4 (DPP4) are associated with the cell receptors of type 2 (ACE2) and the DPP4, respectively, after which a membrane synthesis occurs.
Citoplasm is released by the gene of the virus RNA; after the replication of the viral gene, the gene RNA, together with the ophthalmic glucoproteins and nucleop acid proteins, generates viral vesicles that are then released from the membrane cell by releasing the virus.
The first reports on the gender sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coron virus, with a gene of 99.98 per cent corresponding to 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of disease on the Huanan marine market in Hughan.
Genetic SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the aid of an electronic microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the ultrasonic particles of the human respiratory tract.
It has been established that the ACE2 human farm is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the human ACE2 farm as weak as SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients less difficulty than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate an unknown short-term protein coded orf3b and a secret protein coded orf8.
The Orf3b virus SARS-CoV-2 may play some role in the pathogenicity of the virus and cause IFNB Express; however, the Orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a collection of authors, together with Zhou (Zhou), submitted reports on the micro-electronic tomography of the full-scale ACE2 plant, allowing 2,9 Å in the B0AT1 aminokislot transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conversions, was collected as a diameter and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could connect two S-proteins, which served as evidence in identifying and infecting the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic mixture when performing a medical screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate trade
It is known that both the source and the SARS-CoV, and the MERS-CoV, were the cure of mice from which the virus was transmitted to humans through the civilian and vertebrates respectively.
A phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses established that the first SARS-CoV-2 producers were the cure of mice, since the new virus at 96% was identified by two like SARS Coronaviruses, namely the coronaviruses of SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what form has become an intermediate business, which has enabled the virus to overcome the barrier and affect the human being; the way of transfer is still to be explained.
Mr. Czy (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the transmitters of the virus from flying mice to humans were snakes, in which the homologous recombination occurred in S-protein.
As a result of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins, long-term milking agents that are used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate traders SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic difference between the pangoline virus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference in 1 per cent between the two genes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results have not yet been obtained with specific evidence (res. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown in most cases.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may live within 48 hours in the dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40 to 50 % of moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 can have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat up to 56 °C in 30 minutes; effective blocking the activity of the virus may be epher, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorus oxide, peroxy, chloroform and other hydroxydines, but not hydroxydine.
The human population in general is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to a new virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronary viruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (see section 4.4).
As a rule, the virus has begun to recognize an infected immune system through known receptors (ODRs), including C-type, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
By means of various mechanisms, the virus causes the expression of the burning factors, the formation of dendrites cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons that inhibit the spread of the virus and speed up macrophages in relation to virus antigens.
However, the N-Belka SARS-CoV can avoid immune reactions.
An appropriate immune response is included in the fight against virus soon.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the protection of the body.
CD4+ cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ cells directly kill infected cells.
T-Helperes produce anti-smoker cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus may inhibit the function of T cells by causing their programmed death.
Immunities, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also play an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies from an outpatient were neutralized by MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system would result in the local education of a large number of free radicals, which could be a cause of serious harm to the light and other organs and, in the worst scenario, would lead to polyurethane deficiency and even death.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2, for which a classic phenomenon is likely to affect older people with contemporary pathology and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection above for people who are affected by a large number of viruses or who have an immune system breached.
According to the study of the first 425 cases of infection, the average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly from 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period lasted for 3 days, with the distribution ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A later described above study based on demographic data of 8,866 cases showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2).
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time limits for quarantine measures, taking into account the precise calculation of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to infected subjects in which the disease is spread unsympathetic.
General practice became a 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with the virus or infected virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended until 24 days?
The main and primary symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which may be the only manifestation or accompanying other symptoms, such as dry skin, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, headache, stomach pain, thirst, chest pain, diarrhoea, cough and fever.
In some patients over a week after the beginning of the disease, isolation and/or hypoxia were observed.
In severe cases, disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed severe respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acid and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and severe leukemia should check the virus for early diagnosis even if there is no pathology in breast cells.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptoms prevalence rates: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry castel, 55 per cent single and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients required an artificial ventilator.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of family injury and the transfer of virus from unsympathetic infections.
Similar results were obtained in 2012 in studies with MERS-CoV patients with major symptoms, including high temperatures (98 per cent), dry castel (47 per cent) and per cent (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of these were required for artificial ventilation, which is much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and is consistent with a higher mortality rate than that of MERS.
In patients with MERS, diarrhoea (26 per cent) and abdominal pain (21 per cent) were also observed.
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperatures (99–100%), dry castel (29–75%), single (40–42%), diarrhoea (20–25%) and pain in the throat (13-25%), and artificial ventilation is required for 14–20% of patients.
On 14 February, COVID-19 deaths were 2 per cent and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
In comparison, the mortality rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a death rate of 37 per cent of 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of the earlier study, the basic product indicator (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at level 6.47 at 95 % of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23 while R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality level and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show a higher capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to be distributed compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in the case of a new virus is lower than that of the latter.
Thus, the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The classic phenomenon often occurs in injury within a family or group of people gathered together for any reason or accompanied by a transport, such as a cross-line.
Patients often traveled to Ohanh or other affected regions, lived there or contacted infected or sick during the last two weeks before the beginning of the disease.
However, according to the data provided, humans may be virus carriers without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients treated with the disease may be re-initiated by the virus, and this is a worrying signal to prolong the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients had normal or low levels of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1 099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphomas with leukocyte levels < 4×109/L, including leukocyte levels < 1×109/L, as well as increased asparagine aminotransferase and virus levels.
In some patients, elevated levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes have been detected, while in most patients, elevated levels of C-activative whiteness and cirrhosis were observed in the blood.
In patients with severe D-dimary disease, the fibrine drop product in the blood has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has been steadily decreased.
In most patients with COVID-19, pathologies characterized by non-equivalent constipation with both sides or type of "mathe glass" were found in the case of an X-ray study.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe pain and severe respiratory disease (ORD).
In the development of the ODA, uncontrollable warming, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant deterioration in the gas supply.
The performance of Type I and II tyres reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases the surface load, thus reducing the ability of the light to increase and increase the risk of light falling.
Thus, the worst results of the X-ray study are often the most serious cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the removal of pneumatic pneumonia, the formation of iodine membranes and intermittent lymphocyte infiltration, and multi-synthetic cells in patients who died from disease, according to the pathology of viral infection and OCR and similar findings in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19, RNC SARS-CoV-2 was used through a polymeric cross-sectional reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, taking into account the high level of false-risk results that could accelerate the rate of epidemic development, from 13 February 2020 in China, diagnosis was initiated on the basis of clinical manifestations (not only of CPCs with reverse transcriptase).
The situation was similar to the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, data on disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and results of X-ray studies are critical for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Group of Experts, led by Mr. Feng Zhang, described the SHERLOCK-based methodology protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this methodology enables the detection of synthetic RNCs SARS-CoV-2 by 20 × 10–18 mol/l to 200 × 10–18 mol/l (10–100 copies per microlith of the original sample) with the help of indicators less than without the use of the complex equipment.
This new method, if it successfully carries out clinical examinations, can significantly improve the sensitivity and ease of the tests.
Because of the lack of experience in the treatment of an unknown cancer virus, doctors may primarily provide patients with COVID-19 only with supportive therapy, while trying to use any therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronary viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These therapeutic methods include the ongoing or potential use of antiviral medicinal products, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasmas of communicable patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even plasma should be used for treatment in adult patients.
The pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
At the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly easily, and possibly to a lesser extent affects other ACE2-expressive organs, such as the iron-and-thee tract and the needles.
However, the violation of the work and rejection of the breathing organs are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high concentration of oxygen, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation of the mild to the disease, is essential to ease the symptoms and survival of life.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracurricular membrane oxidation (ECMO), modified method of extrapulmonary blood treatment used to treat life-threatening or respiratory failure.
In addition, it is important for patients with SARS-CoV-2 to maintain a water balance, prevent and treat secondary infections and septic shock, as well as to protect vital organs.
It is known that cytokine fever is the result of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected by SARS and MERS.
The cytokinetic storm is a form of a systemic combustion process that develops in response to the cytokines series, including TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNB, IFNG and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immunities to emit a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of development of the ODA and polyurethane deficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine fever, particularly in patients with severe conditions, the emphasis on immunity is important.
For the treatment of cytokine fever, corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies served as an interleicin-6 inhibitor were used.
Other methods of cytokine therapy based on immunosuppression include the modulation of immune response to T-cell control; the blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; the injection of ynus-quinase; the use of blinatumomab, cytokine inhibitors 4 and hystondeacetase inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the effects of explosives in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants.
However, steroids in large doses do not benefit from the treatment of severe pain in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they may cause serious side effects, especially vascular osteoporosis, which greatly undermine forecasts.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical conditions.
At the time of the preparation of this document, no effective anti-virus therapy has been confirmed.
However, internal remedicivir, nucleotide analogue, was an effective treatment of an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed anti-virus product originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, the remandiser also demonstrated the possibility of exposure to other viruses with the same start-up RNA, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these data, the Gilead company provided this medical composition to China for male studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and expected the results of these studies to be patience.
In addition, baricinib, a-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as possible options for treating patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, tachycardia, rash, and other side effects.
Caution should be exercised to monitor the interaction of these medicinal products with other medicinal products designated by patients.
The plasma of patients with dementia and the development of antidepressants
The collection of blood in patients treated with infectious diseases has been used for a very long time to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect the health of the population.
In fact, the blood of adult patients often contains a relatively high number of antibodies to fight pathogens.
The antibodies are in immunoglobulins produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other innovative objects; they recognize individual pathogens molecules and neutralize them directly.
Based on this premise, plasma was obtained from the blood samples of patients treated with COVID-19, which then weighed 10 patients.
During 24 hours, their symptoms improved, increased the intensity of burning and viral load, and increased the flow of blood oxygen.
However, in order to propose a mass application of this method before a specific therapy is carried out, it is required that there be no verification and no explanation.
In addition, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully considered in view of the therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the immune system too much and cause the cytokines to get out of the system, which, taking into account toxicity, poses a potentially life-threatening risk.
Concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low, and plasma to treat patients in critical conditions is much required.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat global epidemics.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to give B-cells to breast-feeding patients and to define the genetic code of active antibodies or to use a screening to find effective antibodies to critically important whites of the virus.
So we can move to the mass production of antidepressant immediately.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of many components of the formula, which differs from the diagnosis of disease based on the theory of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the active components are still unknown or have an indeterminate activity, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
In the meantime, because of the lack of effective specific therapy, COVID-19 has become one of the main alternative methods for treating patients with mild and moderate severity of symptoms or for patients who suffer after a severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Zie Du (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were recognised to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The largest proportion of patients with COVID-19 had been observed in a number of China provinces where the Chinese traditional medicine was used in treatment of 87 per cent of patients, including Ghana (63.7%), Ninisa (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the Chinese traditional medicine used only 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 was the lowest percentage of patients (13 per cent).
However, this is quite a comparison, since the assessment should take into account many other factors of impact, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published research materials that compared treatment exclusively to Western medicine and combined treatment on Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the period of normalization of the body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical assistance under the station was less than felt in patients treated with combination methods of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients treated with only Western methodologies.
The most surprising fact is that the proportion of patients who began to suffer from symptomaticism (from mild to severe) was noted below in the group treated by combining the Western and Chinese Traditional Medicine methodology rather than in the group treated only by Western methodologies (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than the second (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still requires more closely controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in a larger number of regions.
A particular interest is also to receive, where possible, a mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of or combination of components used in Chinese traditional medicine methodologies.
Patients who suspect or confirm the existence of COVID-19 are primarily under the threat of acute and even deadly disease, while people who are closed to quarantine also experience shock, loneliness and extreme distribution.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as leukemia, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects such as corticosteroids, may cause further anxiety and psychological stress.
Early stages of the outbreak of SARS virus have been reported with a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotive awakening, psychotic symptoms, deliries and even sociological behaviour.
The mandatory follow-up of contacts and quarantines, which include measures taken by health authorities to prevent COVID-19 epidemics, can increase the concern and feeling of guilt related to the spread of infection, quarantine and social clemency on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspects and contactants, as well as to all the other people it requires.
In the context of psychological support, multi-professional psychiatry briefings should be developed, clear and accurate information on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and treatment plans should be provided, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in stopping the strains of transmission from the infected and infected people to acceptable customers and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy used to prevent new viruses.
Work has been undertaken to create vaccines based on S-protein, aimed at producing long-term and high-acting neutralising antibodies and/or protection immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, live weakened vaccines were developed from SARS virus.
However, prior to clinical trials, the effectiveness of these potential vaccines in natural conditions should be determined in the case of adult patients, the model of mortality and the level of protection against zone virus infection.
The possibility is that SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and has not been reported in any new case since then.
At the same time, there continue to be cases and classes of diseases caused by the MERS virus that are born in the Middle East and spread in other regions, thanks to the conservation of ozone-depleting sources in endemic areas.
In order to combat MERS, vaccine strategies have been developed using an inactivated virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and components of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated on animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for persons who do not have immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to prevent an epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long-term (meaning 18 months) required for the development of vaccines and the dynamic change in the corona virus.
In the absence of an unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a full picture of the clinical duration of the disease by thousands of patients.
In most cases patients can be gradually cured without any difficulty.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to draw up a prognosis model to determine the priority of the measures they have taken, especially in areas where the lack of resources is observed.
Based on the clinical data submitted at the time, the following factors may affect the forecasting of disease in patients with COVID-19 or associated with it (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the spread of disease caused by SARS virus, which was also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study.
In patients who require intensive therapy, the risk of originating diseases and complications was significantly higher than those who did not require such therapy (meaning 66 years versus 51 years), which showed that age was a progenitor factor for patients with COVID-19.
Paul: Infection of SARS-CoV-2 among men above women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: in patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy, there is a high risk of acute myocardial and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of the death of patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with ACE2-positive Holangiocytitis, which could lead to the deterioration of the liver function in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely related and can produce results.
The deviations identified in laboratory studies: the levels of the C-reactive white in blood reflect the severity of the respiratory or tissue injury and are proposed to be considered as a potential progenitor factor in the duration of disease, treatment and final treatment.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the levels of C-reactive protein, the degree of severity of disease and the forecast at COVID-19.
In addition, the results can also be expected to increase the level of lactose dehydrogenase, asparagin aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine.
These plants are distributed in large quantities by various organs, especially the heart and the liver, and their emissions are affected by tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or perpetual function.
The main clinical symptoms: for predicting results and difficulties in treatment with COVID-19 together with other factors should be taken into account in the X-ray study of breast cell and in the development of long-term clinical symptoms.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy in order to reduce the severity of the smoking process.
As corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors have developed vascular osteonecrosis, which is a cause of life-threatening disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these preparations should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: as described above, many patients suffer from unforeseen stress, as they often have long-term quarantine periods, high levels of uncertainty and monitoring the death of their relatives and other patients.
In order to reduce stress in such patients and to help them return to normal lives, psychological advice and long-term support must be provided.
According to the demographic studies currently conducted, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to the low respiratory tract replication, SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronary viruses that cause ordinary respiratory diseases, can successfully multiply in upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have suffered from a disease or who have not yet completed an incubation period may be able to spread the virus to a significant extent, which is a major obstacle to epidemiological control.
However, transfer of SARS-CoV virus was thought to occur when patients were seriously ill, since in most cases it was not in the early stages of infection.
Thus, the COVID-19 epidemic today is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
At present, there is a great work in China, which has been announced by the universal quarantine in Ohana and neighbouring cities, as well as extended quarantine regimes practically for the entire population in order to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures have a significant impact on the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients identified is reduced, which refers to delays in the spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the period of inflammation will extend from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues thought that the COVID-19, which seemed much more complex than the SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two thirds of the world's population.
The Panel of Canadian Experts reported that SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in the bone marrow and throats taken in patients who had recovered and hospitalized two weeks earlier, indicating that a new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to a flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategy may have had an impact.
According to the original estimates, Ebola’s leukor had to be exposed to millions of people and be responsible for the loss of millions of patients.
However, due to severe quarantine and insulation of the disease at the end of the end, it was possible to take control.
It is likely that, like SARS-CoV virus, the infection capacity of SARS-CoV-2 may weaken and, over time, it will disappear or become less pathogenic virus with humans.
A comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics is shown below (res. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through the shell or seal, as well as possibly through direct contact with the materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been detected, which means that it can also be transmitted orally.
According to one of the recent studies, 41 per cent of 138 studies have been reported as a result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other diseases identified earlier and 40 patients.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, particularly health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even those who contact patients or infected.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the person; and surgical masks and N95 receptors (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Hierarchical masks do not allow fluids from potentially infected people to fly into the air and sit on the surfaces from which they can be transferred to the environment.
However, only Class N95 masks (series No. 1860s) can protect against the breathing of viruses of 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of viruses; SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm.
Since parts can even detect five surgical masks combined, medical personnel directly contact patients must carry N95 (series No. 1860s) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the mask, medical personnel should wear a protective helmet on the figure in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also fall into the organism through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, despite having carried a Class N95 mask; the virus may have fallen into his body through the eyes.
Medical personnel should therefore also carry transparent personal protective shields or masks of a closed type.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently by dissipating fear-free means, to try not to leave home by self-sustainment, and to limit contacts with potential infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is estimated to be approximately a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus has not previously been known to humanity, its high level of similarity to SARS-CoV reported on 7 January 2020 should have been a worrying signal for China, taking into account the experience gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Center for Disease Control, Hughan, calmed citizens, reported that the new virus had low contagivity and limited reproductive productivity when it was transferred from man to man and that prevention of spread and control of disease would not be a problem.
This statement has greatly reduced social tension, especially during the time when all countries were preparing for the New Year ' s celebration, and was missed critically when the disease could be maintained within the limits of Mr. Ohanh with minimal losses.
The health authorities of China can take this serious lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more public statements as each word is taken into account and can affect their relationship and decision; (2) monitor and respond to unusual information coming from a clinic rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and staff; (3) take more decisive measures to prevent the potential epidemic at early stages of its development, rather than discourage the public; and (4) more targeted and effective education to increase public awareness of epidemics and regular testing and improvement of public response systems.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by an unexploded coronavirus of the heavy type II respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
Less than two months after the disease covered all of China, the document was circulated in 50 countries of the world at the time.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), the presence of the COVID-19 has resulted in SARS relapse.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in terms of the prevention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than youth and men than women; the proportion of cases and mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
As a result of SARS deaths above COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 are spreading the virus even when the disease is unsympathetic, whereas patients with SARS are usually affected by the environment only in cases of serious illness, so it is more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is widely distributed faster and faster than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal tests with SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, patients treated may again show positive samples of the virus.
All of this greatly increases the risk of spread of the virus.
In the light of such rapid progress of the COVID-19 studies, some important issues remain, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of 96 per cent gomolog between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS-like coronaviruses, we still cannot confirm that SARS-CoV-2 had been infected with mice.
What kind of animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original holding, for example from flying mice, to man?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely stop the transmission process, and the epidemiological situation can be resolved at any time.
Modelling at the molecular level and biochemical samples showed that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but what is the virus being introduced into the respiratory cells and causing subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also link to other organs producing ACE2 cells?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of human transfer?
Will it become the cause of the world pandemic, will it disappear as SARS, or will it recur regularly?
These aspects are of primary importance, but time will be needed to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
The knowledge of the origin of human crown viruses
Motivation and adaptation have stimulated the evolution of coronovirus (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
By 2003, it was known that two human coroner viruses (HCoVs) were causing a mild disease, such as a usual spread.
The outbreaks of the heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our view of how catastrophic and life-threatening can be the damage to the human brain.
The occurrence of a serious type-wide respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China by the end of 2019 has again attracted attention to the coronary viruses and has struck us with a high degree of transmission, but a weaker pathogenicity of this virus compared to the SARS-CoV.
Coronavirus infection is a zone, and the understanding of its zone origin will be very useful.
Most of the human coronaviruses come from lactating mice for which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoirs of certain human crown viruses are also known.
The definition of animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
The study of the interaction of animals with coral viruses can also shed light on the pathogens of coral virus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on seven human crown viruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zone origin and ways of interfering.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing various human corona viruses in terms of viral evolution and genetic recombination.
In this context, the present disease epidemic caused by the crown virus detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also addressed in this context.
Furthermore, conditions needed for the successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of ophthalmic viruses with a positive polar NRC.
These viruses, with the largest of the DNA-containing genes containing 26 to 32 thousand nucleotide viruses, have been named thanks to its form, which, when considered under the electronic microscope, recalls the origin.
From the perspective of the structure, coralviruses contain unseparated genes from an identical organization.
About two thirds of the genes contain two large, partially-opened accounting frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translucent in polyproteins of pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further designed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked by nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open framework for structured proteins, including schipobic (S), oval protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronavirus also contain a number of line-specific accessories.
Based on differences in the follow-up of white\ coralviruses, four species (alfa, beta, gamma and deltacore virus) include most of the human coronaviruses (A, B, C and D).
There are philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta-Cron virus is the treatment of mice and grison, while birds are the primary reservoir for gamma and deltacone viruses.
Thousands of years ago, coroner viruses were constantly overflewing the middle barriers, and some of them evolved into dangerous pathogens.
Today, seven human crowns are known.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five beta-ocorone viruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the coronavirus of the heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the Coronavirus of the heavy respiratory syndrome of the second type SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of mild form, e.g. simplicity and/or diarrhoea.
Unlike them, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV virus and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogens, causing severe low respiratory infections compared to a higher number of patients with a higher risk of rapid respiratory disease (ODA) and external symptoms.
The first human coroner HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of patients who were infected with mild disease in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have collected more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a general concept that the human crown virus was considered to be totally worthless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastating epidemics in history; more than 8,000 people were injured and about 10 per cent of the total mortality rate was estimated.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading peacefully in the rest of the world.
A new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019, subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the cause of the current epidemic of COVID-19 (COVID-19), which, as of 3 March 2020, had more than 3,120 lives and more than 91,000 people had been infected.
The alarm signal has been received, and peace must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have a zone origin, their origins are mice, mice, or domestic animals.
Many data collections show the benefits of the evolutionary nature of all human coronaviruses from flying mice that have been well adapted to organisms that do not have pathogens, but demonstrate a broad genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has exposed China and the world to serious health, scientific, social and moral challenges.
A study of the spatial mechanism for human crown viruses will enable them to understand their natural history, the forces of their evolution and factors that limit inter-transmission.
It may also suggest or accelerate the search for a reserve, intermediate and amplifier SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the spread of disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the zone origin, intermediate transfer and pathogens of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we have noted and considered the following common features: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses are usually not pathogens for their tankers, but are acquired pathogens after the transfer to the new carrier.
We are also analysing the trend towards the evolution of human crown viruses, which often leads to the reduction of pathogens.
The same context is also considered as a result of the current rise in SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the strain B814 HCoV-229E was first obtained from a sample of patients with mild disease, various coronary viruses were found in various infected animals, including rats, cats, pigs, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past decade, seven human crowns have been identified.
Table 1 presents a brief history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was obtained from tests taken from the respiratory tract of patients with the infection of upper respiratory tract in 1966; the virus was further adapted to the spread of WI-38 leukemia cells.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, mild symptoms, including headache, nausea, general discomfort and pain in the throat, were observed in 10-20 per cent of high temperature and cough.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was removed from the organic culture and the subsequent serial passage into the brain of mice.
Clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to symptoms of HCoV-229E, which are not different from other respiratory pathogens, such as A influenza virus and rinavir.
The HCoV-229E virus and HCoV-OC43 have a global spread in the world and, generally, are distributed in colder times in dead areas.
During the primary incubation period, these two viruses would last for less than a week and would have approximately two weeks of illness.
According to the study of volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a simple simple form.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity experienced severe low respiratory infections.
The outbreak of SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia epidemic”, became the first in all history of humanity a well-documented pandemic caused by the human brain virus, and the curer was the virus SARS-CoV, the third of the identified human coronary viruses.
The first case of SARS disease was found at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and disease spread in many countries and on various continents.
Without regard to the overactive distributors, it was assumed that each patient could affect about two more people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the peak of viral load was 10 percent of the disease.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, pain in the muscles, headaches, high temperature, general discomfort and confusion, and later symptoms include isolation, cough and respiratory failure.
The proliferation of laboratory deviations from SARS standards is lymphopia, print tests and increased creatinine levels.
Patients with SARS are also monitored for diffusion of alveoliary injury, spread of epithelial cells and macrophages.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients are subsequently required for intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, other organs, including iron and steel, may also be infected in addition to low respiratory conditions, which are usually accompanied by cytokines, which may be rare, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
The first virus was derived from an open biopsy of the mild relatives of a patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to study human crown viruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was awarded to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
It was first established that it was mainly affecting young children, older people and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory disease.
In the case of HCoV-NL63 diseases, such as fever, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchialitis are symptoms.
In another independent study, the same virus was described in the 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands who suffered pneumonia.
The virus was detected in the Netherlands, but in fact it was spread everywhere.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is a cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peaks of the disease are at the beginning of summer, summer and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to the structural laryngitis, which is also called the mass.
HCoV-HKU1 was assigned to Hong Kong in the same year from 71-year-old men hospitalised with pneumonia and bronchialitis.
In addition to renal pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with the spread of asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes respiratory diseases, has been found worldwide.
All of these four human crown viruses that cause communicable infections have been well adapted to humans and their mutations, which have led to highly pathogenic diseases, usually minor, although their causes have not been known, as often as with a more viral subtype HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious low respiratory infections in China.
Usually, the ability to effectively transfer and remain in the human body becomes less viral or pathogenic.
Coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first assigned to Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a mild 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and initial insufficiency.
Most of the confirmed laboratory cases were located in the Middle East, but in several European countries and Tunisia, cases of detention and distribution have been recorded through epidemiological second-party injuries in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak of 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) remind you of the symptoms of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) — an progressive acute pneumonia for both infections.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed a serious initial disability, which has so far been different from the other diseases caused by man-made cancers.
More than 30 per cent of patients have iron and oxygen symptoms, such as diarrhoea and fever.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases of a high mortality respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent) were registered, therefore MERS-CoV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to humans.
From the middle of December 2019 to the end of 2019, in the province of Hobbey, classes of patients with pneumonia were identified, which are now being examined in the past, linked to the infection caused by the coronavirus of heavy type 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization stated that the continuing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global emergency in the field of public health, and the same disease has been called “Coronavirus 19” (COVID-19).
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were registered worldwide, with deaths of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the death rate in the province of Hobbey is 4.2 per cent, and beyond that is 1.2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2, such as SARS and MERS, is a severe respiratory infection characterized by an increase in temperature, weight and unity.
Some patients also experience diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to pass into the severe respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82 per cent), these viruses, however, form a variety of philogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but has greater ability to transfer compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of unsympathetic infection SARS-CoV-2 have been recorded, indicating that the virus is able to spread rapidly throughout the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other human crown viruses reveals significant similarities and differences.
First, the human transmission of coronary viruses is similar to the period of incubation and the duration of the disease caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the remaining six human crown viruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms ranges between SARS-CoV and four human crown viruses that cause communicable infections (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar because it is often observed when human coronary infections occur, including indiscriminate manifestations, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also highlights the legality of both human crown viruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coral viruses that cause communicable infections.
On the other hand, there is still a need to check whether SARS-CoV-2 is reduced with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each next person), such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses that cause communicable infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in rock samples.
We still have to answer the question whether the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is as important (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
It is also of particular interest to ask about the possible session of SARS-CoV-2, which is characterised by human crown viruses that cause communicable infections.
Nevertheless, the future development of the continued momentum of COVID-19 will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including the transferability, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after transition.
All four human crown viruses that cause neurological infections with mild forms of symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, these people may well have adapted to these four human crowns.
In other words, they and others could be called the only survivors after the pandemics of human crown viruses in the past.
Human crown viruses that cause serious diseases in humans and people in which human crown viruses cause more serious diseases have simply not survived.
In order to do so, human coronaviruses must be repatriated in the human body in sufficient measure in order to collect appropriate mutations that are contrary to the factors in which the carrier is confined.
In this regard, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 flow continues and the more people will be infected, the more likely the virus is to be completely adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, its transfer to people will be difficult to stop using quarantine or other infection control activities.
For many years, the population has been circulating four vertebrates that have led to the normal use of human immunosuppressants.
These viruses do not require a veterinary reservoir.
High-passive coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been properly adapted to human beings, and their transfer to humans cannot be supported.
They need to remain and multiply in their zone reserves and to search for cases of disasters in the most affordable human missions, perhaps through one or more intermediate or strengthening carriers.
The SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four HCoV-invoicing viruses.
It is very easy to transmit, as well as non-ferrous HCoV, at least at the present time.
But he's more pathogenic than the extrapolated HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to man and whether it will be circulatored in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, strengthening, and reservoirs of HCoV viruses.
The animal is an evolutionary carrier of HCoV, if it carries a relative advantage with the same high level of nycleotide traceability.
The premise virus is usually well adapted and unpatogenic to the carrier.
Similarly, the tanker is constantly transferring HCoV over a long period of time.
In both cases, the carrier is naturally infected and are the natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only taken into the intermediate carrier directly before or around the time when it was taken by a person, it was not properly adapted to the new carrier and was often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier may serve as a zone source of human infection and play the role of an active carrier, allowing the virus to be subjected to painful reparation and then transmitted to its people by increasing the level of human suffering.
HCoV may be transferred to a pipe infection if it is not possible to prevent the transfer within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish long-term anaemia.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural tanker.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that the zero patient SARS had an anomaly contact with the pets (child).
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that the IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV virus are higher than the population in general.
The Himalayas (Pagumua larvata) and the entovised dog on the markets of live animals were the first to be identified by virus carriers such as and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This has been confirmed by the fact that no more has been reported on SARS cases since the destruction of all civilians on the markets.
At the same time, it was reported that, in the case of natural or farmed birds, not in the market, SARS-CoV did not determine, in most cases, that it was possible to conclude that the Himalayas could serve only as an intermediate booster rather than a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that because 80 per cent of the various animals on the Guangzhou market have an antidote to SARS-CoV, it cannot be excluded from the possibility that intermediate boosters can also serve many types of small milking.
They're all told by the stupid users of the SARS-CoV virus.
The next search for a natural animal carrier SARS-CoV identified a nearby CoV flyer, which was called a tip-on-titic coronavirus of HKU3 flying birds (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and who was present in the Chinese flying bats.
These mice are positive for the SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genetic traceability of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of flying mice have 88 to 92 per cent the same nycleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the basis for a new concept that flies became carriers of new human pathogens.
There have also been several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV), but none of them, except one that is known to be HIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that SARS-CoV receptor is a human angiotensin-converting plant 2 (ACE2).
It has been shown that WIV1, obtained from the sample of falsified meat, uses ACE2 meat,cive and human as a receptor for entry into the cell.
Interestingly, the strains of respiratory patients from SARS could neutralize WIV1.
Today, the WIV1 represents the most close relative advantage of SARS-CoV in flying mice, with 95 per cent of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high gomology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that the WIV1 is not a direct parent virus SARS-CoV and that the treatment of mice is not a direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
The philogenetic analysis refers to MERS-CoV for the same group as CoV-HKU4 flyers and CoV-HKU5 flyers.
CoV-HKU4 flies and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, diptylpideptidase-4 (DPP4) to detect viruses.
Consequences of the RNC-dependent DNA polymers virus MERS-CoV are philogenetics closely related to the follow-up of the beta-coron virus of the flying mice identified in Europe and Africa.
Until then, there were no live MERS-CoV virus in the wild birds.
The nycleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its close relative CoV-HKU25 flyers amount to only 87 per cent.
That's how flies could not be the direct reserve carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that one-third of the clouds are sero-positive to neutralising antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as to the clouds of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The life MERS-CoV, an identical virus found in humans, was classified from the nasal bags of one-celled vertebrates, which further confirms the role of the vertebrate as the true reservicants of the MERS-CoV.
It is also noted that vertebrates, experimentally damaged MERS-CoV, have been observed with minor symptoms, but with massive viral exposure.
It is noteworthy that infected red blood cells were not only by respiratory, but also by faeces-oral, which is also the main way to treat the virus in the larynx.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome have not been identified with eye contact prior to symptoms and are likely to be related to human transfer or transfer of unknown channels, including undetected species of animals that are carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% equivalent to CoV RatG13 flying mice assigned to Asian subcontinent Rhinolophus afinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the discrepancies between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are too large to record parental relations.
It is possible to fly the mouse and not be the direct reserve carrier SARS-CoV-2 unless in the future almost identical coronaviruses of the flyers will be found.
It is assumed that the immediate animal carriers of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that sell and kill on the marine market, which has been linked to many of the initial cases of COVID-19, which shows the likely case of transfer from a human being.
Several recent studies led to the conclusion that the group that threatened the destruction of small lactic acids known as manis javanica could also transfer the parent beta-coron virus, a family strain SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the traceability of these new pangoline cancer genes is 85 to 92 per cent consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also closely related to RatG13, which is about 90 per cent of the identity of the nucleotide sequences.
They are classified in two subdivisions of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, in a phylogenetic tree, one of which is closer to SARS-CoV-2, with the traceability of amino acid at 97.4 per cent.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 strains are more diverse, despite higher levels of traceability in all genes.
In the earlier study of pathogens, it was also reported that viral contaminants were identified in simple tests, which were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Other methods of collection and manual processing were used in this study to ensure the consistency of the gene, which included around 86.3 per cent of the full-scale viral gene.
It cannot be excluded that Pangolin has become one of the intermediate animals SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of consistency between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-ocorone-mongoline virus, the family SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from Pangoolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is longer than between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronaviruses of pangoline related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established in lactating mice, pangolins and other milk-producing species.
At the time, the highest traceability homologous was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronaviruses of pangolins, family SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 were the highest traceability homology of all genes.
Very theoretically, a high level of similarity between the pathogens of the pangoline, the SARS-CoV-2 family, and SARS-CoV-2 is linked to parallel evolution through selectiveness.
The opposite proposal is based on the recombination of the beta-CoV virus, the SARS-CoV-2 family, and the RatG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, the recombination is widely spread among beta-ocortic viruses.
The final decision on the direct zone origin of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be taken.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, zone origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NLL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may occur from coronaviruses of flying mice while the parent strains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in grison.
It was reported that the coronavirus of flying mice called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in the North American triangular Astrologer showed close contact with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to other coronavirus flying mice called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which has been discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be obsessive.
For the sake of clarity, current knowledge of the origin of certain coroner viruses is summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of the cross-examination of HCoV in anamnes.
When HCoV-OC43 was transferred between 1890 and people were affected by domestic animals, the respiratory infection pandemic was registered.
The history of the intermediate transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alfaconaviruses have been detected in flies, nearby HCoV-229E.
Among them is alpine alpine alpine alpine.
Some data support the direct transmission of the virus from the larynx human.
Firstly, people, not alpines, were able to contact flying mice in the general environment.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpines.
Second, the alphacoron virus of the larynx, the family HCoV-229E, is different and pathogenic in the larynx, while the alpine alpine virus has caused the introduction of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpine alpine alfa has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, it is not possible to exclude the likelihood that alpines received alphacoronavirus, a native of HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, flies are a direct source of pathogenic human viruses, including the virus of the liver, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that flies could be transmitted directly to people HCoV-229E.
On the other hand, while larynx alfacoron viruses could be used by HCoV-229E, alpines and one-off clouds could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of the intermittent transfer from flying mice to one eyebrows and one to the other.
The evolutional origin of the MERS-CoV virus from lactating mice was known for its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is evident that flies provide rich pools of viruses for the exchange of gene fragments and intermediate transmission.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly by flying mice are ideal distributors.
On the other hand, the MercS-CoV virus was introduced by a single watch of decades ago.
It has been well adapted to these valves that have been converted from the intermediate carrier into a stable and natural tanker.
These animals have MERS-CoV very easily disease and have a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its epidemiological transmission is an accident, and the person remains a foolish carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of vertebrates in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus elsewhere.
In particular, the pathogens of the pangoline are highly pathogenic in the pangoline.
They may also be vacuum carriers of beta-CoV-family SARS-CoV-2, as well as civilians in SARS-CoV.
Future studies need to confirm or exclude several possibilities for the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 virus from the human being.
First, flies may be a replacement carrier for the virus, native SARS-CoV-2, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
People can make an environmental nest with flying mice by looking at or dividing the nests of these animals.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate boosters in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently fallen.
People are infected by the virus through the distribution of salt and the consumption of meat of wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are hosted to SARS-CoV-2.
The survey of domestic and wild animals on the antibodies was justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third type, which has been linked to both flying mice and pangolins.
Search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to various animal types, three main factors from viruses have also contributed to cross-border barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in the RNC replication.
In comparison with other viruses, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered to be “mean-high” with the average rate of replacement of approximately 10-4 times per year in Part 2 depending on the stage of adaptation of Coronavirus to new customers.
Coronaviruses have an adjustment of exorbonic acid, resulting in an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakness or even incompatibility.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir has caused the replication of coronavirus through the induction of this exobionic acid and the RNC-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising against SARS-CoV-2, which needs to be checked during clinical studies.
Nevertheless, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is nearly a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if the corona virus is not adequately adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high frequency of mutations, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is shown below, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
The virus is likely to have been adapted to another carrier, close to man.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-beams.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and anti-virus preparations from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose effectiveness as a result of the genetic waste.
Second, the large gene of RNCs in the corona virus produces greater plasticity in the genetic modification of mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of inter-sective evolution that facilitates the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This contributes to the many unique open-ended frameworks of the calculation and functions of the proteins identified in the 3′ end of the gene.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique mechanism for selecting matrix, coralviruses are randomly and often switch the matrix during RNC replication.
During the transmission of DNA to the carrier, which serves as a mixed court, it is often replaced.
High-level and subgeneral RNAs can recombine and create new coroner viruses.
The phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Interaction of the virus—the carrier for transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, another key factor important for cross-border transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier's receptor.
This article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates the evidence of a positive selection in the event of an interim transfer, is a combination of SARS-CoV.
Based on a comparative analysis between SARS-CoV human and civilian strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV is rapidly adaptable to various carriers, particularly with regard to white S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
In general, RSD White S coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier's response is intensively selected.
The SARS-CoV is a amino acids, from 318 to 510, to S1 fragment, which is linked to angiotensin transformer 2 (APF2) human and its receptors for the introduction of the virus in the cell.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to identify the receptors of APF2 of various animals, including flies, whales, mice and entovisive dogs, making possible the transfer of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues, which are different from viral human and civilian strains, have been detected in the RSD, 4 of which are in the receptor-related motivation for interaction with AAF2 receptors.
SARS-CoV cells have mutations in K479N and S487T in the RSD, which may increase the efficiency of the schipobic protein interaction with the human AAF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be especially important for the adaptation of the virus to man.
It is noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 white S segment leads to a change in the binding efficacy of white S to human AAF2.
In fact, a study using the CRIO microscopic says that the fragility of this relationship is 10-20 times higher than between AAF2 and the SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other contractors are required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to APF2, but with another segment of white S.
There are many other HCoV receptors such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyl acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coroner viruses to humans after the transfer from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of the intermediate HCoV transmission are also managed by other factors of dependence and restriction of the carrier.
The divergence of these protein carriers between humans and natural reservoirs of HCoVs, such as muscle fluids, one-off clouds and graffiti, can be a barrier to intermittent transfer.
For the successful cross-border transfer of HCoV viruses, the factors of dependence and the restriction of carriers should be eliminated.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be identified and classified.
Good results can provide an unpredictability full range of dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 with the help of new CRISPR technology.
New HCoV: back to zero label
The diversity of coronaviruses of flying mice creates a wide range of opportunities for new HCoVs.
In this sense, coronaviruses of flying mice serve as a genetic ball for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination are also a driving force for HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new white-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessories are considered important for people to adapt to ORF8, such as the virus of flying mice, the SARS-CoV family, but it has been established that they are coded with different ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide delegation was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The delegation splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and considers it to be an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible combinations with alpha and gamma-coron virus lines where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNC-dependent RNC-polymerase.
The location of the combinations has also been defined in non-structured whites nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
In a similar way, the epidemiological MercS-CoV has been shown to be recognizable between the different lines, which has occurred in the one-way summits in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoV was recombined with other animal coroner viruses in its indestructible genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in viral genes, which is most likely due to the release of the virus from the selective pressure, for example from the carrier's immune system.
The example of such effects is the loss of ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E by the two nucleotide delegation.
At the same time as an intuition of the ORF4 calculation, it is possible to observe the virus of flies and vertebrates of HCoV-229E, an alphacoron virus of alpaca demonstrates a single nucleotide input that leads to a double frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoV is also due to the pressure of the selection of their reserve carriers.
The signs or absence of the symptoms were recorded in the case of the acute coronavirus infection, which relates to the mutual adaptation of the corona virus to the flying mouse.
It has been said that muscle healings have been both anatomical and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, failure to activate the immune response in lactating mice effectively reduces pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of the killer cell in the larynx has been affected by the adhesion of the Inhibitor receptor of the NKG2/CD94 cells and the low level of the molecular expression of the main HS class I complex.
Moreover, the high level of active acidic acids, which is made up of high metabolic activity in the lactating mice, may contribute to the replication of the coronavirus, at the same time affecting the calculation of exorbonic acid, thereby creating the pressure of the sample for the generation of strains of the virus that are given to the new carrier when it comes to highly pathogens.
The more pathogenic strains of coronavirus may also evolve as a result of the combination, resulting in the acquisition of new protein or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
It is not, therefore, appropriate that, in the last twenty years, there have been three new human crown viruses.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoirs, such as mouse or verblades.
They are certainly repulsed without a strong call to the carrier.
This is a secret to why we see unsympathetic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivity of the immune system and cytokine fever, where the more severe immune response is, the more severe the risk.
On the other hand, non-sympathetic carriers have no immune response compared to the replication of coronavirus.
The same non-reliance strategy may have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
A particularly strong interferonal response in bats.
Thus, the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should have an beneficial effect on the type I interferon.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammation has been reduced in bats.
Based on this induction NLRP3-inflammase using MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 is followed by a common scheme for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the beta-coV virus was found, a 95 per cent nucleotide gomology was associated with SARS-CoV, there was also a corona virus of liquefied mice, the nucleotide gomology of 96 per cent with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that civilians and other animals were carrying viruses on the market, the identical SARS-CoVs were not directly established for SARS-CoV-2.
Bacololine beta-CoV-2 was found, which was found to have been found to be homologous SARS-CoV-2, which indicated that pangolins could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that pangoline beta-CoV-2 gene genes could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
Coronaviruses drew attention to themselves due to recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in flies and other animals has radically changed our understanding of the importance of zone origin and HCoV conservation in human transmission.
Evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from liquefied mice and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and cells on the market, closure of the markets and destruction of the tissue on them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of various lines of pangolin beta-CoVs, neighbouring SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to remove pangolins in order to prevent the seasonal transmission of infection from the markets.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to a person through pangolins and other dairy products and how this may continue to be the subject of future studies.
On the other hand, the MercS-CoV virus has existed for a long time in one of the world's clouds.
These clouds serve as an important vehicle, as well as as the main source of meat, milk, leather and cheese for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to offer all the observations for control over the MercS, as this has been done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to halt the periodic outbreak of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV in combination with other infection control measures.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may occur that cause outbreaks of disease.
The world is circulatory in various zone viruses.
In particular, there is an extremely diverse range of coronaviruses of flying birds with zone potential.
There is a vast number of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zone coroner viruses, which will lead to the emergence of new coroner viruses that are easier to transmit and/or more deadly to humans in the future.
In order to reduce the number of long-term contacts between humans and animals, the use of wild animals in some areas of China should be rejected.
After serious trials, such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and a plan of response to such situations is needed.
In fact, many viruses existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until it is possible to capture new territories.
While many of the properties of flying mice are beneficial for the spread of viruses, learning to stay away from them can minimize the likelihood of contact with flying mice and other wild animals.
In order to better understand the environment of coralviruses and their natural carriers, there is a need for sustained epidemiological supervision for lacticators, which will be useful in preventing the transfer of coral viruses from animal and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the virus zone is to keep humans away from the environmental bottoms of the natural resources of the zone.
There are still some aspects of SARS-CoV-2 that are missing in the heads of zone origin.
First of all, if the flies were transmitted to the SARS-CoV-2 pangolins, it would be interesting to see what conditions the flies and pangolins divide by the same environmental node.
Second, if flies play a more direct role in the transfer of human beings, it is necessary to determine how people have entered into contact with flying mice.
Thirdly, if the true intermediate carrier plays a third milking role, it needs to be explained how it interacts with various types, including human, liquefied mice and pangolins.
Finally, since many milkingers, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological and experimental infection should be carried out.
It may be a fungus, pangoline or other milking, which is expected to be determined by its natural carriers in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its virus.
Further studies in this area have shed light on the evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
There is a need to update diagnostic criteria for “disquieting cases” and “acfirmed cases” COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a short reference guide on diagnosis and treatment of a new Coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides insight into our experience and recommendations for combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, COVID-19 is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased based on current results of studies and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and introduced new diagnostic criteria for “disquieting of disease” and “assisted cases” in accordance with the document “COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Committee on Health of the CRED.
In December 2019 the outbreak of a new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially renamed COVID-19 (COVID-19), and the only viral disease was called “a severe severe respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a short reference guide and published it on the website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication drew great attention to itself.
While noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been constantly updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven copies of the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Therapy Recommendation, published by the National Committee for the Health of the CNR (http://www.hnc.gov.cn/), have been substantially altered.
Recently, comments on our recommendations were made in the work of Zhou (Zhou) with partners, and they contained simple diagnostic proposals based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on this pandemic covering the world.
We acknowledge the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the “COVID-19 Diagnostic and Therapy Recommendations” (test seventh version) and the results of the current studies, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh edition of this document (from 3 March 2020) for a comprehensive analysis of the case of the disease, any element of epidemiological history with two clinical events should be combined:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or location in H. Wahanh and its severity or other humanities where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded during 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (a positive test based on nuclear oxygen); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from H. Hahhhh and its severity or other public sites where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded during the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) types of patients with type 2 types of COVIDs; and (2) types of types of types of diseases; and (2) types of types of cases; and
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes at the early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed disease should be based on suspicion of disease with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the IgG PCR test in real-time is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-generated sequence of the virus shows high ammogenity with regard to new coronaviruses; (3) the positive serum results for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG; or the change in the test with a positive test for a positive positive for SARS-CoV-2 agent IgG, or an age of not equal to 4 in scale.
It can also be noted that the PCR test was added by the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) emissions of that document in real time for carbon dioxide in respiratory pathways or blood tests.
The pathogenic diagnosis of blood tests was added on Thursday (27 January 2020) and on Friday (8 February 2020); then the seventh edition added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers who have sought the optimal collection of nucleoline acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as the analysis of samples taken from respiratory pathways, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of various samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the acknowledgement of disease criteria.
However, there is more evidence of the need to exercise caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptomatic and non-explained symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in the Jøu (Zhou) and etc. should be updated, since those who do not have clinical symptoms are classified as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and studies.
Finally, we hope to receive more direct evidence and invite readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “disquieting cases of disease” and “acquired cases”, we invite readers to follow up and follow closely the latest recommendations made in the countries in which they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in time for effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 — daily maximum
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
This is the largest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Control and Studies of Disease (IEDCR) reported that 114 cases of infection had occurred and 33 patients had been home.
All 17 deaths were recorded.
In the online briefing, IEDCR director, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, said that the victims became four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two who were over 60 years old, two who were between 51 and 60 years old, and one who was 41 to 50 years old.
She also reported that the two missing were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic staff reported to the local news agency Anadou that Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was on treatment at the Metrie Kuwaiti clinic, was one of the victims.
On Saturday, in an online video presentation, the Minister for Car Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh Obadul Quader stated that the public transport work would be completed longer than planned by the following Saturday.
Public transport was resumed on 26 March and was to be resumed on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of first-needed goods — medicines, fuel and food products — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 injuries were recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March in two persons who returned from Italy and one of them.
As of March 19, these three people were already excommunicated.
SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded the millions of cases of infection worldwide
According to the University of Johns Hopkins, the total number of cases of cancer infection by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has increased by one million worldwide.
Of the coroner COVID-19, at least 52 thousand people were killed.
Rubez arrived on the same day when the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of death of the Coronavirus was established in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as a quarter, it was one of a few countries where no cases of infection were identified.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed injuries, including 79,332 cases within twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 in Central-European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection have been recorded, of which at least 5,900 had a fatal outcome.
CBS News, referring to the data from the University of Johns Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths from coronary infection had been committed in the United States.
The world's countries have announced an increase in the prevention of disease spread.
On Thursday, Moscow, Sergei Sobayin expanded the civilisation regime until 1 May.
Former President Vladimir Putin stated that growth throughout the country, despite self-sustainment, would be paid by 30 April at the latest.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of the extension of the emergency situation for 15 days; the results of the vote were 215 to “s” ten to “six”, and one to “suppose”.
Saudi Arabia has extended the time of command in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day, while the time of command lasted only 3 hours until 6 morning.
Thailand planned to enter a command hour from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewain, announced that the domestic self-sustainment regime in the State territory was extended by 1 May.
Stores in Australia are limited to the quantity of toilet book packages that can be purchased once
In the evening of the resurrection and Saturday evening, Australia's Woolworths and Cole stores reduced the quantity of toilet paper packages that could be purchased once in all country stores, up to two and a package accordingly.
On Monday, ALDI also limited one pack.
These restrictions were reported on the casinos and on the Facebook website.
It is reported that citizens have begun to make extra savings because of the fear that COVID-19 might hinder the introduction of the common self-sustainment regime.
In the middle of the Woolworths network, there was also a limit to the amount of the toilet book purchased to one package.
Earlier, 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packs.
In its press release on 8 March, the Coles network reported that, with restrictions on four packages, “in many shops, the toilet is still too fast – one supply over an hour”, and called this “unforeseen” question, while ALDI, published on Tuesday, called this trend “unexpected”.
According to the representative of Woolworths, a sharp increase in sales was observed last week.
The costco store in Canberra also limited the amount of two packages last week.
In order to meet the deficit, Cole had to order larger suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths had ordered additional parties, while ALDI had made spare parts for a special advance sale.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Ritillary Association, reported that the Ritillaries were attempting to fill stocks, but this was difficult with regard to the restrictions of local authorities on the schedule of the carriage of vehicles.
It is expected to increase the worth of the product, as suppliers are trying to meet the demand, but there are still fewer benefits.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores could not operate on the average due to stock-incineration.
In his report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, expert on trade differences from Queensland University of Technology, said that stores were filled with stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet book was a commodity, so the number of storage stocks was small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, a number of long lines remained empty, strengthening the sense of lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the poles could be filled, and such goods as toilet paper rolls and hand tools could be placed on these poles in large quantities, buyers would probably not be so panicked,” says Russell Zimmerman.
In the past, the manufacturer of the revised toilet book Who Gives a Crap reported the end of the stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the company manufacturer of the toilet books Kleneex and Solaris Paper, as well as Sorbent brands, reported that they work round-the-clock to ensure sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sale site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne was reduced due to the absence of buyers on the weekday of work, some sales of real estate began to offer the first auction participants free toilet book.
The fourth edition of the daily NT News printed in Darwin included a tab on the 8th page for drawing and using as a toilet book.
According to ABC Australia's report of 3 March, the beginnings of shops have imposed restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, stating that they are not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also benefit from an increased demand, including medical masks, hand-designing, gallantry, hand-to-hand and pain-free.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on the evening of the resurrection, it was noted that the online stores of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of the toilet book Andres by two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic
In the middle of the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Health Organization announced the pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandam” refers only to the extent of disease, rather than to the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments need to take measures:
“All countries are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic”.
This could be done if countries were to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, follow-up to cases of illness, and mobilize their citizens," said Mr. Tedos Adama Gabrielus, Director-General of WHO.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and the seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is “unforeseen”.
In his interview with CNN in February, he said that “no other respiratory virus except flu has not yet been observed since it occurred to the continuous global spread”.
Mr. Gabrisus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never observed pandemics caused by the corona virus.
We have also never seen pandemics that can be controlled before."
First, in January WHO announced the outbreak of this emergency in the field of public health, which was of international importance and then introduced a new pandemic.
The Director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infections of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said: “It’s just beginning, it’s going to get worse.”
According to the Associated Press report, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 disease have been registered worldwide, and more than 4,600 people have died.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020 is the present place at the time of the COVID 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) caused by a serious severe respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Ohana, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 the international public health emergency situation was announced, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 disease have been registered in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were injured.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include leukemia, cough, and difficulty breathing.
There are potential complications of pneumonia and severe respiratory dystrophy syndrome.
The time from the first occurrence of symptoms to the outbreak of disease usually consists of about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available.
The recommended preventive measures include dry hands, closing the throat, monitoring distance between people, detecting and ensuring self-insulting people who are suspected of being infected.
Governments around the world responded to the situation by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantine measures, commandal time, risk control at work and the closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to a serious global social and economic impact, transfer or abolition of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a widespread lack of goods that are undermining the Spanish procurement.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, which affected about 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.
In the Internet, there were cases of xenophobic and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other Eastern and South-East Asian citizens, or people who remembered them outside, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of virus spread have been identified.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Uhan (the capital of Hobbey), China, reported the occurrence of pneumonia for an unknown reason, and the situation began to be investigated early in January 2020.
The cases of injury were mainly related to the Hughanian maritime market, so the virus, as they believe, has a zone origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak was known as SARS-CoV-2. It was recently discovered that it had a major link to the coronaviruses of the muscle, pangoline and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the injured did not visit the market after that date.
Two third cases of damage recorded in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of the Morning Post, which was not verified, suggested that the first case of injury had occurred with the 55-year-old resident of the province of Hobbey on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of injury in China had declined, but the number of new cases outside China had suddenly increased.
The number of cases of illness may be significantly reduced, particularly due to many cases with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, less than 2.4 per cent of patients 19 years of age and younger were registered, and the United Kingdom’s chief scientist, Patrick Wallans, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before the establishment of an effective group immunity in the country.
Statistics include cases of injury to people who were tested at COVID-19 and whose test was positive under official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country was able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, official policies were adopted that did not require testing of only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that 86 per cent of COVID-19 injuries were not detected in China until 23 January and that such unregistered diseases were a source of injury for 79 per cent of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual injury in Italy was significantly higher than the number of recorded cases.
Initial evaluations of the baseline reproductive infection (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
In a study published by the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, it is expected that the indicator could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well exaggerating.
In other more complex cases, from the beginning of the development of symptoms to the moment of death, the most common period was from 6 to 41 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of those who died were related diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Official data on mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include reports of deaths of patients with positive results of COVID testing performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account dead people who have not been tested — for example, in the case of death in their home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
The incomplete data in Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVIDs 4-5 times.
The Secretary-General of the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges: “We know that [the number of people killed] is lower than actual”. His words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the United States. Such data are often addressed in pandemics such as H1N1 2009 swine influenza epidemics. The first confirmed death was recorded in the U.S.A. on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China was registered in the Philippines on February 1, and beyond Asia, France on February 14.
On 28 February, more than ten deaths were registered outside China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, countries and regions on all continents, except Antarctica, reported cases of death.
All indicators vary depending on the region and the time of spread of disease; they also affect testing, quality of health systems used in the treatment scheme, from the beginning of the outbreak of disease and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health. The death/disease factor is the number of deaths reported in the diagnosed cases during the time period.
According to statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and injuries is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
The data vary from region to region.
In China, mortality rates decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of mortality as a result of the disease (CFR) — the percentage of patients who die from disease and the percentage of death from the infection (IFR) that reflects the percentage of infected (such as diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients dying from the disease.
These statistics do not relate to specific time periods and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the time of injury to the end of the disease.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these indicators by specific groups of people.
According to the University of Oxford, the mortality rate from this pandemic is estimated at 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The high number of this range is consistent with the results of the first COVID-19 licensing test in Germany, as well as the statistical study that analysed the impact of CFR assessment testing.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the shock are not defined and may vary depending on the location.
Mace Boni, a staff member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infection shocks usually go to bed, and then, when the number of accessors is over, they start to burn.
However, in the present situation, it is virtually impossible to make any reasonable forecast as to when this will occur.”
The Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Mr. John Naishan, claims that “all can end by June”, if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kujarski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will be circulatory for perhaps a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the direction of Nila Ferguson, “until the vaccine (maybe 18 months or more) has been created, it will be necessary to comply with physical distance measures and other measures.
William Schaffner, a staff member of the University of Vanderbilt, says: “I do not think that the corona virus will ever disappear, because it is so easily transmitted,” and that it “may become a seasonal illness, winning every year.”
The validity of new advances will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively unspecific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are increased temperature (88 per cent) and dry castel (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include stiffness, dyspepsy (slips), loss of appetite, swelling, pain in the muscles and joints, pain in the throat, headaches, nausea, vomiting, vomiting, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO claims that it is seriously affecting the development of respiratory problems, for example, every six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have listed such urgent symptoms as breathing difficulty, persistent pain or feeling depression in the heart, sudden sensation of consciousness, difficulty in awakening and killing the person or loss. In these symptoms, medical care should be immediately sought. Further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory dystrophy, sepsis, sepsis, and death.
Some infected people may suffer unsympatheticly without any clinical evidence, but as a result, the analysis confirms the severity of the injury, so doctors recommend that patients in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed under strict control and investigate the subject of infection.
According to Chinese scholars, the number of cases of unsympathetic disease ranged from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The usual incubation period (time between injury and symptoms) is from one to 14 days; it usually consists of five days. Until there is no full light on the symptoms of fatigue loss: the initial assessment of the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still unknown.
It is considered that the disease is primarily transmitted during close contact, as well as through small capillaries that are distributed in the air with a bowel, chicing or during conversation; contact is understood to be in the radius of 1 to 2 metres (from 3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, the caps can be extended from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small caps issued in air during a conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods, and respiratory caps can also be formed at exits, including during the conversation, even though the virus is not normally transferred to the air.
The caps can fall into the mouth or nose of a few people, as well as into the light.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac and cardiac resuscitation (SDRs), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and consequently to the spread of viruses in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person is exposed to contaminated surfaces, including skin, with subsequent irritation to his eyes, nose or throat.
There is also a risk that the virus may be transmitted through failure, but the risk of such transmission is low.
The Government of China rejects the possibility of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most affected during the first three days after symptoms occur, although its spread may occur both before symptoms occur and at later stages of disease.
There were cases when the tests were positive for three days prior to symptoms, and this indicated the possibility of transmission of the virus before the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of unsympathetic disease, but studies on monitoring of contacts in some countries have also revealed cases of transmission of disease from non-smokers.
European Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) claims that until it is clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one of the most common infections affects 2 to 3 others.
In particular, it was found that the virus is able to live for three days on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and the operating table (304) on a cardboard surface for one day and on a medium surface for up to four hours.
However, these data vary according to capacity and temperature, with positive results from COVID-19 in domestic and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, even though the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, just like after contact with other surfaces that could be subjected to infected people.
The severe severe respiration syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first discovered in three people with pneumonia from the group with severe respiratory diseases registered in Ohana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the natural corona virus. The virus can be destroyed with the help of the domestic honey that unlocks its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 has a great similarity to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is supposed to have a zone origin.
The genetic analysis of Coronavirus showed that it was genetically classified as Betacoronavirus, Sarbecovirus (cellular line B) along with two other strains of flies virus.
At the full-genome level, it is 96 per cent identified by other models of the coronavirus of the fly mouse (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the traceability of pangoline and human viruses.
A complete gender comparison to today showed that the largest percentage (92 per cent) of the virus is between the pangoline virus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate producers of the virus.
The virus infection may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although in the end it should be confirmed by analysing the polymeric cell reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or computer Tomography.
The results of studies comparable to the PCR and CT methods used in Ohana have shown that CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specifically, as many of its visualization functions correspond to other pneumonias and disease-related processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation that “not use CT for screening or as a test method for the first line in the COVID-19 diagnostics”.
WHO published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2 and the first of them was published on 17 January.
A polymeric cell reaction test is carried out in real-time (RT-PCR).
It can be performed on breathing samples and blood samples.
The results are usually ready for a period of several hours to a few days.
The test is usually used as a test, although it can also be used for the liver. A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests that enable the antibodies to be detected.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them were sufficiently precise to obtain approval for universal application.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for use in exceptional cases only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of X-ray symptoms and computer Tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral disturbances of the stomach type and lack of pleural drinking.
The international picture base of alleged injury is being drawn up by the Italian radiological society.
Due to similar infections, such as adenvirus, when identified by COVID-19, non-confirmed PCR tests, there is limited clinical specification.
A major study was conducted in China, where the results of the breast cell CT were compared and the testing of CPCs, and it was found that while the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be encrypted more quickly; they were more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method could be considered as a screening tool in the affected areas.
For the diagnosis of viruses using X-ray and computer Tomography, circuit neuron networks have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence.
The prevention strategies include the maintenance of a general personal hygiene, dry hands, avoiding eye irritation, nose or chest pain with red hands, use with a knife or latrine that should be excavated immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in people’s places.
In order to prevent the spread of disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated from the population, and that many Governments refrain from any sudden journey to the country and areas affected by the outbreak and restrict the movement of civilians.
However, the virus could be spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among people who do not know where and how it has been infected, and medical personnel who are infected with patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions and precautions when contacting other people and the means to protect their eyes.
The use of data on the location of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose caused concern about compliance with confidentiality, such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty) and more than 100 other organizations, with statements to limit this type of surveillance to people.
Various mobile applications were developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on the development of decisions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, such as the registration of the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user has been in close contact with the person who has been positive for the COVID-19 test, he will receive the appropriate notification. There are also unreasonably unconfirmed versions of how to prevent injury, such as the detection of the nose and the ear, which is actually not effective.
At this point, COVID-19 vaccines do not exist, although many organizations are working on it.
In order to prevent the spread of disease, it is recommended to wash your hands.
The CDC (Center Control and Prevention of Diseases) also recommends more wash hands with milk and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or when it is severely damaged, as well as before it, after it is freezing, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, in the absence of a human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic mollusc that covers its protective cover.
In addition, if milk and water are not available, CDC recommends that disincentives be used to treat hands with a spirit content of at least 60 per cent.
WHO recommends that people avoid injuries to their eyes, noses, or arms.
The surfaces may be affected by a number of solutions (at the surface of the steering wheel the disinfectant begins to operate at a minute after loading) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2–7.5% iodide.
Other components, such as benzalconic chloride and glucose chloride, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in the institution, such as the office or the daily station, all the spaces of such premises, including cabinets, toilets, general use facilities, electronic equipment, such as plans, sensory screens, keyboards, remote control pools, and bunkers used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that the mouth and nose cover the mouth and lips of the patient or the tablet and immediately extract the substances used by hygiene.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of masks may limit the size and range of the products that are distributed in air during conversation, tea and cheese.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virologist at Lids University, “the use of medical masks can reduce people's dignity regarding their faces, and the torture of their hands is a major means of infection”.
WHO recommends that healthy people carry medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, for those who are driving a man with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using a mask actually reduces the number of injuries to a person.
Several countries have begun to call for public health masks.
CDC centres, the United States, recommend wearing tissue personal masks for non-medical purposes. China has emphasized separately the importance of using single-range medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 ft) or less).
In Hong Kong it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Health officials in Thailand invite people to prepare and monitor personal clothing masks in their homes.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are forbidden to go out on the street without masks covering their nose and feet.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to carry masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to the product stores to hope for medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks were produced on the average of March, it was scheduled to use medical masks for all passengers on travel and on international buses.
The people of Panama are obliged to wear a medical mask on the street; so it was recommended that people who cannot afford masks should be put on their own under domestic conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by the inhabitants of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-infective measure aimed at reducing the spread of disease by minimizing close relationships between people.
The protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and commercial centres.
People can use social distance measures to stay home, to limit travel, to avoid people's places, to use contact and to physically distance from others.
Many of the Governments of the regions, particularly those who have suffered from shock, are currently either prescribing or recommending social isolation.
The maximum number of people who could be gathered in one place according to the recommendations of the United States Government and health organizations was gradually reduced from 250 (in regions where there were no COVID-19) to 50, and later up to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the collection of groups involving more than two people. Older people and health authorities who suffered from such diseases as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertonia and weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious infections. CDC recommends that they stay home as long as the outbreak of disease occurs in the region.
The use of the term “social distance” has been understood to mean that people should be completely isolated, rather than remain in contact with other people in alternative ways, and some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it has been recommended that only your permanent partners whom you live with are sexually involved and that you are convinced that there is no virus and its symptoms.
People with diagnosis of COVID-19 and those who suspect that they are infected are recommended for home isolation.
Health institutions have published detailed self-assessment instructions, and many governments have also imposed a mandatory regime or recommended that all affected areas be placed on quarantine by themselves.
People in high-risk groups had a higher quarantine rate.
Persons who may have been contacted by COVID-19 or recently visited the country or region, to a large extent affected by the epidemic, have been advised to be on quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
The strategies for successful combating disease include preventing, suppressing or mitigating the spread of disease.
The prevention of the spread of disease is carried out in early stages and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to understand other measures to control infection and vaccines in order to stop spreading disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to mitigate the spread and mitigate the effects of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to prevent and mitigate the effects of the spread of disease may be taken at the same time.
The impact of the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of cases of infection to below 1. Part of the response to the outbreak of infection is aimed at reducing the epidemiological peak known as epidemiological bleeding.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacative interventions that can help to cope with shock include personal prevention, such as hygienic hand, use of medical masks and self-sustainment; public measures aimed at physical isolation, such as shutting down schools and eliminating mass activities; community involvement in the promotion of such measures and participation; and environmental measures such as cleaning of surfaces; and since in China the severity of the shock has become apparent, there have been more decisive actions aimed at stopping shocks, such as urbanizations.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, massive screenings and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as the work of the system of information on the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to persons infected on self-sustainment and paid large sums to those who did not.
In Taiwan, there were increased production of medical masks and drugs to collect surplus stocks, and modelling in Britain and the United States showed that there were serious problems with mitigation (suspending but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and depression (relief of the epidemic).
The optimal policy to mitigate the effects of the spread of disease can reduce the heavy load on the health system by 2/3, and mortality is double, but it still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapses of health systems.
The injection may be preferred, but it should be used until the virus is circling among the population (or until the vaccine is not developed if it occurs earlier), as the spread of the disease will be restored as soon as the measures are weakened.
Long-term involvement in the spread of pandemics leads to social and economic costs.
Antiviral preparations approved for treatment with COVID-19 are not currently available, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing of existing preparations.
Taking non-receptive medicines from the mouth, drinking sufficient fluids and breathing may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the patient's illness, oxygen therapy, internal fluidisation and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic resources” could facilitate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers improving the capacity and adaptation of health to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a major response to the outbreak of disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Regional Office of WHO have issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to help redistribution of resources at a number of levels, including focusing on laboratory testing on COVID-19, eliminating emergency procedures where possible, detecting and isolateing patients with approved COVID-19 diagnostics, as well as increasing the potential of intensive therapy by training and increasing access to IVL and coke.
There are different theories about where the first case of injury could occur — the so-called “noble patient”.
The first known occurrence of a new Coronavirus infection was likely to take place on 1 December 2019 in the city of Hobaye Province, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of coroner virus infection in the province of Hobbey was gradually increased.
They were mainly linked to the optimal market for Huananian marine products, which also sold live animals, and one of the theories is that the virus is in the human organism of one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zone origin. On 26 December in the province of Hobbey, the case of a mass disease of unknown origin was recorded by Dr. Jean-Tyanzzi, who was working on the case at the Center for Control and Prevention of the Disease in the City of Wahan.
On 30 December, a group of doctors from the city centre of Uhanh warned their colleagues about “colonavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Venelan, were warned by the police about the responsibility of spreading false reports, and Dr. Ay Fen received an answer from her leaders for the panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Ohana Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
The Ohana health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia that were sufficiently large for the initiation of the investigation in early January, and at early stages, the number of cases was approximately doubled every family from half a day.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread in other Chinese provinces, contributing to the Chinese New Year’s celebrations and the fact that Wahan is a transport and a major railway route.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of injuries in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shanghai.
According to later official data, by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had been infected by the symptoms of the disease; as of 26 March, China and Italy had reported the highest number of reported injuries in the world. On 9 April 2020 more than 1.61 million cases of injuries were recorded worldwide, more than 97,000 people were killed and more than 364,000 were injured.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one registered case of injury.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have limited their freedom of movement and border control.
National response measures included measures to prevent the spread of disease such as quarantine (known as the mandatory home, forced house-to-house or isolation), as well as the command period. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were located in some form of quarantine, with more than 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people on the island of South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure grew to 2.6 billion people — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 disease was registered in Ohana on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the reliability of the information that was not verified was dated 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Jean Czisin worked with the case of massive pneumonia of an unknown type, and on 27 December her clinic informed the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhanh.
The first genetic testing of patients' samples, held on 27 December 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Ohana Municipal Health Commission issued the relevant public notice.
WHO was notified that day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Ohana about the responsibility for the “expression of hearings” of the attack.
The Chinese National Health Commission originally claimed that there was no “explained evidence” of the ability of a newly discovered virus to transfer from man to man.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Si Cispin “national war”.
The events of “the same large-scale quarantine in the history of humanity” were announced on 23 January on the health chain and on the prohibition of entry into the Wahan and, on the other hand, the measure was later distributed in a total of 15 cities in the province of Hobbey and affected about 57 million people in total.
In the city, the use of personal transport was prohibited.
In many places the New Year's celebration was canceled (January 25th).
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Hoshunuşan, which was completed in 10 days.
A second hospital, Leishnuşan, was subsequently built, which was adopted by other progressive patients.
In addition to the newly built Chinese hospitals, 14 other institutions, such as the conference centres and stadiums, have also been re-financed in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, including the release of health reports for travellers and the extension of the New Year ' s holiday period.
University and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In a number of regions, the Chinese authorities introduced a remote working regime.
In the province of Hobbey and beyond there were restrictions on travel.
The schedule for public transport was changed, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, a movement control regime was introduced, and about 760 million people (more than half of the population) were expected to have been confronted with some form of air-conditioning restrictions, after a global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” virus from other countries.
For example, 14-day compulsory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international passengers entering the city, and only one case of intra-country infection occurred five days earlier in the case of a person who returned to Guançao from Istanbul on 23 March.
On 24 March 2020, China Prime Minister Li Ketzen reported that the spread of disease in the country had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been controlled.
On the same day, the restrictions on travel to Hobaye, other than Ohanya, were lifted, which occurred two months after the closure of the province of Karantin. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that on 28 March the entry for persons with a visa or type of residence would be suspended.
Those wishing to come to China will have to make statements to receive visas in Chinese missions or consultations.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government invited businesses and factories to resume their work and provided financial and credit incentives to the companies. On 4 April, a national three-minute silence “minute” opened on the day of the victims of the Coronavirus, announced by the State Council and in agreement with the empty Queen, but the central government requested citizens to pay respect to the dead internet, following a physical distance, in order to avoid the recurrence of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have been deployed in the territory of South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, many of which were due to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Schinchung.
The Shinchongji investigators arrived in Taghu from Ohanya, which is likely a source of shock.
As of 22 February, 1,261 (about 13 per cent) of the 9 336 followers of the church reported symptoms of illness. The highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea on 23 February 2020.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases of injury have been recorded in Korea on 28 February, and this figure has already risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were located on quarantine after three soldiers had confirmed the presence of viruses.
As a result, the flight schedule of airlines has been changed, and South Korea has launched a program to eliminate the population from the presence of viruses, to monitor contacts and organize quarantine measures for contact individuals, which is considered the largest and best in the world's view of its organization.
The screening methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through the mobile application of all visitors from abroad, criminal testing of the virus, which has already been prepared for the next day, as well as increased testing opportunities to test up to 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's programme is considered successful in combating the scourge of disease, despite the fact that it has not been isolated from the entire cities. The South Korean society was initially divided because of the reaction of President Mun Jae Ina to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that praised or called upon Mr. Munu to give an impression that the Government's response to the outbreak of the disease is inadequate.
On 23 March, it was reported that the lowest number of cases of injury were recorded in South Korea for one day for four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April all newly arrived outside the border would be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to the media reports, on 1 April, South Korea requested assistance in the testing of 121 countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 injury in Kume, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people were late that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has distributed five trillion rivals to combat the virus.
President Hasan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government is not planning to subsidize the quarantine of all areas affected by the outbreak, but only individual individuals will be placed on quarantine.
In March, plans to limit international travel were announced, but the intensive movement between cities continued prior to the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrines in Kume remained open for Palms until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
On 28 February, more than ten countries related cases of ill-treatment with Iran, indicating that there may be more than 388 cases recorded by the Iranian Government to date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on 3 March, the results of the virus testing were positive.
On 12 March, Human Reits Wotch (“On Human Rights Detention”) called on the Iranian prison leadership to release human rights defenders detained for the sake of peace and to release all prisoners eligible for this category temporarily.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of spreading virus in closed institutions, such as prisons where there is insufficient medical assistance.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day — the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian policies and government officials had ended.
As of March 23, 50 new cases of coronary disease were registered in Iran each time, and every ten minutes — one new death from coronary virus.
According to the WHO representative, the level of illness in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also expected that the United States sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights required the mitigation of economic sanctions against countries most affected by pandemics, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease fell on the Italian territory when two Chinese tourists tested SARS-CoV-2 in Rome with positive results.
The number of cases of injury has grown rapidly, which has prompted the Government of Italy to stop all flights to China and China and to announce the emergency situation.
A non-cooperative class of COVID-19 injuries was later discovered. It began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardi on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree on the detention of rape, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Josephe Conte said: "Enter the disease emergency zone and exit will be covered.
In those areas, it was already ordered to cease business and to cancel sports activities." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered that all schools and universities be closed throughout the country, as 100 people had already been sentenced to death in Italy at the time.
All major sports activities, including the A football matches, were to be held outside the closed doors by April, but all sports activities were suspended as at least one month on 9 March.
On 11 March, the Prime Minister of Conte arranged to stop almost all commercial activities and close the business except supermarkets and appetite. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analisation, Reinitiation and Intensive Treatment (SIAARTI) issued recommendations on health ethics on the procedures for establishing the integrity of the provision of medical assistance to patients who may be required to benefit.
On 19 March, Italy invaded China at the level of the death of the Coronavirus, taking the first place in the world, following a declaration of 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it was announced that Russia had sent nine military aircraft to Italy with medical equipment.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of Coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 health cases, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that this high level of mortality in Italy can contribute to the combination of two factors — the large number of elderly citizens in the country and the lack of access to a greater root virus than today.
The United Kingdom responded peacefully to this virus from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020 the British Government did not force citizens to comply with any form of social distance or quarantine.
As a result, the Government was criticized for the lack of rapid and serious response to the threat posed by the people of the country. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending that all travel and social contacts be stopped, with no priority, by offering people the opportunity to work from home and avoid public places, such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities such as baseball and sports clubs should be closed as soon as possible and promised workers to pay up to 80 per cent of their salary, but not more than 2,500 pounds per month as measures to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures on social distance, preventing more than two people from gathering and restricting travel and active air-conditioning.
In contrast with the previous measures, these restrictions were introduced with the involvement of the police, the introduction of taxes and the spread of people.
The majority of enterprises were required to close, except those that provide “people’s vulnerability”, including supermarkets, patents, banks, economic stores, car repair stations and garages.
On 20 January in the Pacific North-West of Washington, D.C., a man who returned from Ohana on 15 January was confirmed first in the territory of the country of the disease COVID-19.
On 29 January, a Task Force was established in the White House to Combat Coronavirus.
On 31 January, the trauma administration announced an emergency situation in the public health sector and imposed restrictions on entry for visitors from China.
On 28 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, led by the United States Government in the field of public health, announced that it had developed its own team for testing.
Nevertheless, the testing of the population in the United States has not begun immediately, and the actual extent of the outbreak of disease has been hidden during this period.
The testing was difficult because of the absence of tests issued by the Federal Government in February, by the end of February of the Federal Government's authorisation for non-State testing teams developed by scientific organizations, companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria prior to March, which would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done on the appointment of a medical doctor).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests were conducted in the United States on 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests were conducted by 13 March.
On 22 March, Associated Press reported: “Many patients even with symptoms and appointment of a doctor have been waiting for their hours or days to be analysed.” After a report on the first case of the death of a Corona virus in the United States on 29 February, Governor Jay Insley announced an emergency, which was also announced by other States as well.
On 3 March, the schools in Seattle were dismissed and schools were closed in the middle of March. On 6 March 2020, the Group of Epidemiologists of the Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the projections of the impact of the new Corona virus on the country.
On the same day, President Tramp signed the Act on Additional Provisions for the Preparation and Response to Corona Virus, which provided emergency assistance to federal authorities in the amount of $8.3 billion to respond to the outbreak of the disease.
Corporations had imposed restrictions on travel of staff, had cancelled the conferences and had invited staff to work from home.
Sports events and seasons have been cancelled. On 11 March, the Tempp announced restrictions on travel in most of Europe, with the exception of Britain, for 30 days starting on 13 March.
On the next day, it expanded its restrictions, including the list of Great Britain and Ireland.
On 13 March, the President announced an emergency situation in the country, which allowed federal funds to be used to combat the crisis.
Since 15 March, many companies have closed or reduced working hours throughout the United States, contributing to the fight against the spread of the virus.
As of 17 March, the epidemic was confirmed in all 50 states and in the region of Colombia. On 23 March, 10,700 cases of substance injury were reported in New York, which exceeded the total number of cases in South Korea.
On 25 March, the Governor said that social distance was likely to be an effective measure, since the double rate of cases was reduced from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, 32 308 cases of disease were registered in New York, and 672 persons were reported to have been registered in the United States on 26 March, with more confirmed cases of cancer than in any other country of the world, including China and Italy.
According to media reports from 30 March, President Trump decided to extend the period of social exclusion until 30 April.
The same day, the USNS Comfort hospital was rented in New York port for 1,000 coke.
On 3 April, 884 deaths from coroner virus were registered in the United States.
In New York, on 3 April, the number of cases of disease increased by 100,000. The White House criticized the fact that it did not underestimate the threat and provided a censorship of information on open-ended access, with the assistance of Vice-President Mike Pensa's office, public statements and publications of officials and health experts in the area of the virus.
In general, the view of President Trampa of the success of the crisis was shared by the parties.
Some officials and prosecutors have challenged the United States dependence on the import of key materials, including items of primary need, from China.
In mid-January 2020, Travel Medicine published an analysis of the air travel scheme used to map and predict disease spread models.
On the basis of information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taiwan adopted the largest number of passengers from Ohanya.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also regarded as popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was called the least ready for the outbreak of disease, while Australian cities were considered the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its plan of action in emergency situations related to the new Corona virus (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is said that there is still much to be explained about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay particular attention to border controls and communications in the event of a threat.
An emergency situation in the area of human security was announced in Australia on 21 March.
Thanks to the effective quarantine measures applied in the public transport sector in Hughan and Hobbey, some countries planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through the hijacking of their native countries, to which the Chinese authorities granted their authorization.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan stated that it would not be possible to evacuate citizens from China.

On 15 February, the United States declared that US citizens on the cross-border line Diamond Princess (Brillian Princess) would be evacuated.
On 21 February, 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Brilliant Princess, landed in Trenton, Ontario.
At the beginning of March, the Indian Government began the evacuation of its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, South African Airways, en route from the Government of South Africa, flew with 112 South African citizens on board.
A medical examination of passengers was carried out prior to the outbreak, and four South Africans, with signs of coronary virus, were left in China to reduce the risk.
Only South Africans were evacuated with negative analyses of the Coronavirus.
The analyses were taken to all South African citizens, including summer crews, pilots, personnel, police and soldiers participating in the humanitarian mission, and they were all under surveillance and in quarantine within 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On 20 March, the United States of America began to withdraw its troops from Iraq in part in connection with the pandemic.
On 5 February, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China declared that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had been assisted in China.
Some Chinese students who were taught at American universities agreed to collect and send assistance to the region of China affected by the virus, while the Chikago group reported that on 30 January, more than 50,000 N95 respirators were sent to the N95 clinic. The humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, together with FedEx to 30 January, provided quick assistance to the Uhanya Union 200 000 medical masks, as well as other individual protection facilities, including belts and helmets.
On 5 February, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a donation of $100 million to WHO for the financing of the development of vaccines and cancer treatments, as well as for the protection of the population of the African and South Asia ' s risk group against the virus.
Intervention reported that on 6 February, the Chinese Government transferred to the Philippines as a gift of 200,000 medical masks after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3,16 million masks to the Ohan.
On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would be expected to provide assistance to China at $2.26 million.
Japan has also provided one million medical masks, Turkey has sent medical equipment there, Russia — more than 13 tons of medicines, Malaysia has announced 18 million medical supplies, Germany has sent various medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States has provided 17.8 tons of medicines, and has promised to provide 100 million dollars as financial support to affected countries, and since the situation in China has stabilized, the country has also sent assistance to other countries affected by pandemics.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent doctors and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the outbreak of the cornea virus.
Businessman Jack Ma sent to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1.1 million testing units, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective costumes to be distributed by the organization through its States parties.
Later, he also sent 5,000 tests kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVL equipment to Panama.
The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic also offered medical supplies.
For example, Spain has withdrawn 58 000 Chinese units to test the coronavirus that ensures accuracy to up to 30 per cent, while the Netherlands has withdrawn 600,000 married Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also called for 100,000 non-smokers to be used: they were expected to be manufactured in China, but subsequently they came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency assistance operations to developing countries.
WHO has highly appreciated the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and prevent the spread of infection.
The WHO noted the obvious difference between the situation with the outbreak of atypical pneumonia, which took place between 2002 and 2004, during which the Chinese authorities heard allegations of ensuring that it was preventing the prevention of disease and its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis when the central Government “ regularly provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid the threat of the New Year of China”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to prohibit the movement of goods in Ohana, the representative of WHO, Mr. Goden Galea, noted that, although “this measure was definitely not recommended for WHO”, it was also “a significant confirmation of the obligation to prevent the epidemic in the most widespread place”, and called it “unforeseen in public health history”. On 30 January, after confirming the ability to transfer infection from person to person outside China and the growing number of persons infected in other countries, WHO announced the urgent situation in the 2009 period in which the population was living.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan, stated that the PHEIC declaration was due to “a risk of global proliferation, especially in low and middle-income countries with no reliable health systems.
Commenting on the restrictions on travel, Mr. Tedros stated that “there are no reasons for measures that are too restrictive for international transfers and trade”, and that “the WTO does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO called on the world community to allocate $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, noting the need to provide immediate assistance to those countries who “have no systems to identify people affected by the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our very weak reputation”, and called on the international community to “choose: invest today or pay in the future”. The WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19 at the press conference on 11 February.
On that same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrich agreed to provide “the potential of the entire United Nations system in response to the problem”.
As a result, the UN Panel on Crisis Management, which coordinates all United Nations response measures, has been established; these steps, as WHO says, will allow “the focus of health response, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the spread of disease in a broader social and economic plan”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint special group, which provided the work of international experts and WHO staff on the ground in China to assist in resolving the situation within the country and to assess “the seriousness of disease and its vulnerability”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as on site to assess “Effective response measures at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February WHO stated that “the peace must do more to prepare for the potential pandemic of the country,” noted that “there is no time for this problem.”
When the outbreak occurred in Iran, WHO sent a united group to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the likelihood of the global spread of coronavirus would be increased from “high” to “high” – the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Programme on Emergency Health, warned in his statement: “This is a check by every Government on the planet on the preparedness for the real situation: to act immediately.
This virus may already be on your way to your country, and you need to be ready,” he also stressed that the right responses can help the world avoid “suspending on the development of events”.
Ryan also stated that the current data did not serve as a basis for the announcement of a global pandemic by the official representatives of the public health sector, and added that the pandemic declaration would mean that “we are actually acknowledging the fact that every person on the planet would be at risk of being infected with this virus”.
On 11 March, WHO announced the outbreak of the pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO is “deeply concerned about the high level of spread and severity of disease and at least the alarming level of inactivity on this issue”. WHO is strongly criticized for the deemed inadequate approach to the understanding of the pandemic, including the subsequent announcement of the emergency situation in public health and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
Mr. Tedros Adanoma, a response to the situation in question, was asked by the Director-General of WHO, to submit a motion for a withdrawal of 733,000 persons on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, ten UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respect for each human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to apply for life-saving measures and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Panel stressed that the lack of resources or medical insurance should not at all justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
Experts stressed that everyone had the right to health, including persons with limited means, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless, persons living in extreme poor conditions, and refugees and other non-profit groups in need of public support.
International government organizations consider the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The organization of economic cooperation and development has established a platform for providing timely and comprehensive information on policy responses across the world, as well as for learning and recommending views and recommendations.
The digital divide contains information on the political measures of various countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health and the world economy, address the consequences of quarantine and travel restrictions in order to help countries learn from each other and facilitate coordinated global response to the fight against cancer.
The Government of China has been critical of the United States, Prime Minister Michael Goova and Eduardo Bolsonar, the son of President of Brazil, Jaira Bolsonar, for the anti-pandemi action initiated by the Chinese province of Hobbey.
A number of leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) had been released for the quarantine measures they had taken in the central part of China, and these exemptions were evidenced of a lack of responsibility for political extremism in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China Si Czypin from the anger of the public over the outbreak of the crown virus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Licjana, objected to an earlier statement that the outbreak of the Corona virus had begun in Ohana, but took part in the theory of the contract, according to which COVID-19 was issued in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trumpa referred to the Chinese virus or the Ohanya virus as “the censorship of China only aggravates the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this expression has been criticized by some commentators who claim that such a approach is racist and “reduced from the inability of the U.S. President to stop the spread of disease”.
The Daily Beast gained access to the United States government telegram, containing the communication strategic urgency, as suggested by the National Security Council; however, there is a reference to the strategy: “All cases in China.
We are requested to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television broadcasts." Similar organizations, such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg, have stated that China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of the “progressive effort” to gain global influence.
The Head of the EU External Policy Office Joseph Borrell warned of the presence of “a geopolitical component that includes the fight against the influence of pirates and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China constantly promotes the idea of its role as a responsible and trusted partner, unlike the United States”.
China also called on the United States to abolish sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while providing assistance in the last two countries with some evidence.
The sacrifice of Jacob Ma 100 000 medical masks in Cuba was prohibited from the United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The authorities of the United States are also accused of transferring assistance to other countries in their own country.
Health masks have also created disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has withdrawn hundreds of IVL equipment intended for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union in respect of the Italian border virus.
Maurizio Masari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that "China only reacted in a bilateral manner.
This does not necessarily prove European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone interview with Prime Minister Josephe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized a movement in Italy of Russian military sanitizers, specialized in disinfective transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “political high-level political source” as claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “useless or of little use for Italy”.
The source accused Russia of trying to make a favorable impression on the world community at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Lombardi Attilio Fontana and Foreign Minister of Italy Luigi Di Mayo rejected the attacks on the media and expressed their gratitude for the aid.
Russia has also sent a freight aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Press Secretary Crémél Dmitry Peskov stated that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American medical equipment and materials manufacturers lose their pace of production, they will also be able to provide a response where necessary”.
NATO military training “Protection-2020” planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — NATO’s largest military training after the end of the Cold War — will be carried out in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, described the lessons of Defender 2020 (Protection-2020), "In a crisis that has taken place today in the field of public health, the conduct of these lessons poses a threat not only to the United States and many European parties, but also to the people of the countries where such events should be carried out." The Government of Iran suffered a serious injury from the virus, which was affected by about two dozen members of the parliament, as well as five other present or former political actors.
On 14 March 2020, Iran President Hassan Ruhani addressed the world leaders with a request for assistance, informing that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic because of lack of access to international markets for sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran.
Politologists expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Tramp's chances of re-election in the presidential elections in 2020, and the pandemic had eroded diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan ' s “unmarked and passive quarantine measures” after Japan declared that any citizen coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine facility in special locations.
South Korean society was significantly divided because of President Mun Jae-ina's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that praised or called upon Mr. Munu to give an impression that the Government's response to the outbreak of disease is inadequate, and the pandemic has prevented countries from adopting emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this step will allow Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orban the right to rule without delay through instructions, to cease the work of Parliament, and to make elections and to punish those who will be charged with spreading false information on the virus and on government measures to combat the crisis.
Coronavirus outbreaks have been called due to a number of cases of supply deficits due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods under panic and the collapse of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Department of Food and Drug Control has issued a warning of the lack of medicines and medical equipment, resulting in increased consumer demand and concerns in suppliers.
A number of public places also had a place for panic procurement, which led to the loss of goods from stores, such as food products, toilet paper and bottled water, which, in turn, led to the loss of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, the demand for individual protection grew 100 times.
This drop led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as delays in supply of medical supplies for four- and six months.
It also called for the lack of individual protection worldwide, and WHO warned that health workers would be affected by this.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, the purchasers of the Dagiou system were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
This activity led to a lack of child food in some supermarkets and was subsequently prohibited by the Government of Australia. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Uhana region and the high demand for food, food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade by critically important products that have been made successful have helped to avoid the serious food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
North Italy, which has small agricultural production, has not experienced significant declines, but, in the opinion of industry, prices for agricultural production can grow.
Several food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Hughan, while the government officials of China provided access to pig stocks in order to provide adequate food for the population.
Similar laws, which require food producers to store food in emergency situations, exist in Italy.
The damage caused by the world economy was affecting China: According to the MFI of 16 March, the economy of China suffered severe injury in the first two months of 2020 due to measures to combat the spread of the virus by the Government, resulting in a decrease of 20.5 per cent.
China is a major economic and productive centre, so it is believed that the outbreak of the virus poses a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agate Demarai, a member of the Economicist Intelligence Unit, volunteering on the market will remain until there is a more clear view of potential outcomes.
In January 2020 some analysts believed that the economic effects of the current epidemic on global growth could affect the epidemiological pandemics for 2002-2004.
According to one estimate made by an expert at the University of Washington, St. Louis, the worldwide supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last for two years.
It is reported that the oil exporters' Organization (OPEC) has taken “serious measures” after a sharp reduction in oil prices due to demand from China.
On 24 February, the world's funds markets fell because of a significant increase in the number of people injured by COVID-19 outside China.
On 27 February, due to growing fears about the outbreak of coronavirus, the various funds indexes of the United States, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Dou-Johns Index for Industrial Companies, demonstrated the most recent fall since 2008, with the Dou index at 1191, the largest one-day fall after the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indexes showed more than 10 per cent fall.
On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative forecast.
The actions were rebounded because of the threat of the spread of the corona virus, and the greatest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian has given a high estimate of the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors with regard to the prohibitions of movement, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments to make no travel.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines have abandoned flights due to a serious reduction in aircraft demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Kantas, and the British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cross-border industry has never been strong.
Several railway stations and ports of the railway have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chung-yung, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional Governments have rejected a number of activities involving large numbers of people, including annual festivals; private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many new-year activities have been cancelled and tourist attractions have been closed in order to prevent mass massacres; for example, in Beijing, the blockade has been closed and traditional temple lamps have been removed.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and areas of China, the authorities extended the new channel until 10 February, indicating that the majority of enterprises were not open until that date.
There were 80 per cent of GDP in these regions and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and announced an emergency situation, closed schools until March, and cancelled the New Year's celebration. The retail trade sector suffered globally: the time of business was reduced, and some shops were temporarily closed.
In Europe and Latin America, the number of different trade points decreased by 40 per cent.
In North America and the Middle East, the sales volume decreased by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March the presence of commercial centres increased from 33 to 43 per cent compared to February.
Trade centres around the world have taken additional measures, such as improving health conditions, setting up visitors' temperature, and canceling activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America, caused by the pandemic, can be reduced to 14-22 million more people than it would have been in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, in the outbreak of the epidemic in Uhana, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese migrant workers were housed in the provinces of their country or closed in the province of Hobbey, and in March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the Government for help.
According to the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, an increase of 47 million people in the United States is likely to result in unemployment, and the unemployment rate is 32 per cent. The self-insulation measures introduced in India leave ten million Indian migrant workers working on a daily basis. A study conducted by the Institute of Angus Reida showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households have suffered unemployment as well. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the 20th anniversary of the earthquake in Spain.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers were asked to receive a single social payment.
The German working day pay scheme was also introduced in France and Great Britain.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also suffered greatly from pandemics that have affected the activities of organizations and individuals, whether officially employed or independent, throughout the world.
Cultural and Cultural Organizations have tried to support their (often funded State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society by ensuring the safety of their staff and the public and, where possible, by supporting the people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed throughout the world for an unlimited period of time or access to them had been limited, and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or transferred to other dates.
In exchange, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and more recent and ongoing trafficking has been the result of the spread of the virus, the elimination of religious services, major sports and other public activities, such as musical festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
In the cinema industry too, the Vatican announced the abolition of the activities of the Festival of Weeks in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian period — the Great Post.
Many Europeans recommend that older Christians stay home and do not visit services for the sake of the resurrection; in some churches, church services began to be broadcast via radio, e - mail, or television while some church leaders offer to perform public service.
The Roman Catholic era closed to visit its churches, churches, churches, churches, churches, churches, temples, and shrines, and later other religious organizations ceased to serve and restricted public service in the churches, churches, churches, synagogues, temples and tombs.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of five prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of Coronavirus, and the sacredness was subsequently closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited access to foreign Palms and their own residents in the sacred places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or transferred, including the VEFA 2019-20 Championships League, the Premier 2019-20, the Euro-2020 WEFA, the NBA 2019-20 and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak of the Corona virus also destroyed plans for the 20th Olympic Games, which were to be launched at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would “be carried out by 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021”.
This has led to the fact that many games have gone online, while many sites on gambling have reported a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered because different musical groups have stopped or cancelled concerts.
Many large theaters, such as the shipweis, have also abandoned all their exhibits.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have been able to study and exchange their online results, organize live online concerts or Web festivals; this helps people to continue to perform, publish or publish their works.
The network has seen a number of internet mems on the topic of coronavirus, many of which are assortmentary and reflect the worrying settings that are characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 appearance, there has been a marked increase in predictability, xenophobic and racism in relation to China's citizens and peoples of eastern Asia, as well as to the people of Europe, the United States and other countries' hot spots.
The cases of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In the February information summary (when most cases of injury were still limited to China), the racist attitudes expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who had deserved the virus or received a fair compensation for anything.
In some African countries, the growth of anti-China settings is also observed.
Many Ohanya and Hobbies reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China's citizens, as well as its inhabitants living in the affected areas, have been supported in both offline and online.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first in Europe with a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this respect, such countries may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia, which have been signed by countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea at an early stage, in order to prevent Chinese citizens from entering their countries in order to stop the epidemic.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeTo Japan has taken leadership positions in Twitter.
China's citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on the growing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Tramp was critical of the fact that he called the crown virus “the Chinese virus”; critics consider this to be a racist and anti-China virus.
In Ukraine, protestors attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Ohanya to New Singapore.
Students arriving from the border with China, North-East India and studying in major cities of India reported cases of persecution related to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Dilip Ghocho, president of the State Unit of the party of Bwartia Janata, West Bengalia, said that the Chinese destroyed the nature and “that is why God abandoned them.”
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese council in Calcutta, which called them "misleading". In China, because of the pandemic, Xenophobics and racism were re-examined in relation to non-China citizens: foreigners became known as a "foreign Muslim" and objects belonging to "utilization".
Many newspapers with access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by coronavirus.
Many scientists have published their scientific articles on the outbreak of corn virus in open access.
Some scholars have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their studies on print publishing services such as bioRxiv.
Dispersion of infection — infection from the returning pathogen, range of spreads or how it is commonly unknown

The treatment of wild animals and diseases transferred from animal to animal health risks related to the trade in exotic animals.
The laboratory testing of the 2019 respirator virus (COVID-19) and its SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the OT-PCR, which recognises the RNA.
This test is specific and is intended only for detecting SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population control.
Analytics reveal the number of people who have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too low to treat them in the hospital or are not fully absent.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and collective immunity can be determined as a result of such a test.
As of March 2020, there was no reliable data on the spread of the virus among the population because of limited testing opportunities.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in various countries was very controversial.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which may be significantly higher in some countries.
A test may be performed using a polymeric cross-sectional response in real-time (rRT-PCR) test in a test of different respiratory pathways, including bone marrow or mocrosis.
The results are usually available for a period of up to 2 days.
OT-PCR test carried out only during the first week of disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, but still, it can multiply easily.
In infected patients tested for the second week of disease, alternative substances may be taken from the lower respiratory tract using the drying catalytic acid or may be used in the treatment of decarcination products (mocrot).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Sharite clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 with a polymeric cross-sectional response in real time (rRT-PCR) and was based on 250,000 units that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a collection to detect SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the PPC (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It identifies the gene “E” common to all beta-Coronaviruses, and the gene RdRp, which is specific to SARS-CoV-2. China's BGI Group has become one of the first companies to be authorised by the National Drug Management Authority of China to use the extraneous collection of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the CDC. In the United States, the Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDCC) is disseminated through the International Reagan Resource for the implementation of the RT-PCR in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test sets produced incomplete results due to married reactors and the remote CDC test area in Atlanta, resulting in fewer than 100 tests per day during February 2020.
The two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and only after that date were allowed to be tested by public and local laboratories.
The testing was approved by the Office for the Quality of Food Products and Medicinal Products within the framework of the exclusive authorisation for use.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that COVID-19 could be tested on the basis of RT-PCR worldwide.
Quest Diagnostics began testing at COVID-19 throughout the country from 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been made; the collection and processing of analyses must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virus and Biotechnology, "VECTOR".
On 11 February 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervisory Service. It was reported that on 12 March 2020, Mayo’s client developed a test to detect COVID-19. On 13 March 2020 Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be conducted within 3.5 hours of a major test, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an exclusive authorisation for the use of Abbott laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; earlier FDA issued a similar authorisation for Hholic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Cephehe will also receive from the FDA for approximately 45 minutes on 21 March 2020.
The FDA also approved a test using the technology for the amplification of isothermal carbon dioxide instead of the PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of ambient temperatures, this method can detect positive results in five minutes and negative in 13 minutes.
At present, about 18,000 of these vehicles are in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests a day. At present in Taiwan, a monoclonal antibodies test is being developed, specifically related to the nucleobacteric white (N-white) new coronavirus, and there is hope for results to be obtained within 15-20 minutes, such as a flu test.
A review of the specialized literature in March 2020 concluded that “retgenograms of the breast cell have a low diagnostic value at early stages, while the results of the CT [computer Tomography] may be of such value even before symptoms occur”.
The typical characteristics identified during the CT include the two-dimensional sub-plevelopment focusses of the matte glass type with the periphery, asymmetric and aposterior distribution.
Subpleviated domineering, the symptom of bulimic port and consolidation are being developed as disease progresses.
The results of studies comparable to the PCR and CT methods used in Hughan at the time of the current pandemic have shown that CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions correspond to other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use the CT for screening or as a test method for the first line in the COVID-19 diagnostics”. As of March 2020, CDC recommends using the PCR method.
In part, the immune response to infection is expressed in the preparation of an antidepressant, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infections in people after 7 days of symptoms, to identify immunity and to control population. Analises can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by local diagnostics (PoCTs)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-producing automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each system.
CLT usually uses one form of peripheral blood, although serious samples may also be used to monitor the immune response.
In PoCT, one sample of blood is usually obtained by the perforation of each skin.
Unlike the PCR methods, the blood collection phase is not required for sampling. On 26 March 2020 the FDA referred to 29 organizations that have passed all necessary registration procedures and can now pass their tests on the antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one test on the use of an IgG and IgA antibodies that were capable of combating the virus at the end of March 2020.
The testability of the test consists of several hundred samples over a few hours and therefore this method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the virus RNC.
The antibodies are usually found within 14 days of the infection, and at the beginning of April, the UK found that none of the collections it acquired to analyse the antibodies were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme was developed that allows patients with suspicion of the virus to stay home: “Special assistance officers transfer the patient’s sample sample sample,” the patient floats back, and sometimes receives test results. The British NHS announced that his pilot test of suspected cases would be initiated under domestic conditions that prevent the risk of injury to the patient by other clinical visitors, or that it would be necessary to dissipate the machine as soon as it was used for the patient’s transportation. During the experiment-testing of COVID-19 in case of suspected cases.
The Test Centres helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and wide testing procedures in any country. On 2 March in Germany, the National Medical Association of the underprivileged Medical Insurance Association stated that it was ready to perform about 12,000 tests per day in ambulance conditions, and only 10 700 tests per week could be performed on weeks earlier.
If the study is intended as a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to President Robert Koha, Germany's overall productivity for testing consists of 160 000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, it was proposed that the test be carried out in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that according to the calendar week 12/2020 at SARS-CoV-2, a total of 483,295 analyses were made, including 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) were positive. Israeli clinical researchers Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested the method of simultaneous testing of samples taken in 64 patients, combined samples and carried out further analysis only if a combined sample showed positive results. In the spring of 5 February 2020, the BGI company was opened to a time range of 2000 samples.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI Van Czynam and completed for 5 days; the model showed that, if the laboratory had not been implemented at such a rapid rate, the cases of disease in Hubee would have been 47 per cent higher and, respectively, the costs of quarantine would also be twice as high.
At the time of the opening of the Huo-Jan laboratory in Shanghai, Tanzania, Beijing and Shanghai, there was a rapid opening of the Huo-Jan laboratory in 12 cities in China.
Up to 4 March 2020, the total daily passability indicators were 50 000 tests per day. Open multi-plex Origami Assays schemes were issued, which could test up to 1,122 patients on COVID19 using only 93 samples. Such balanced structures could be used in smaller laboratories, except for the use of robotized fluid manipulators.
In March, due to the lack of and insufficient number of reactors, mass testing in the EU, Great Britain and the United States has become a problem.
As a result, some authors have referred to the test samples, which provide for the burning of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNC genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the level of corona virus testing carried out by the United Arab Emirates in the souls of the population is now higher than that of any other country, and that most of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to the possibility of experimentation, along with the acquisition of Group 42 and BGI of the mass testing laboratory of the population (based on their laboratories to identify the emergency cases of Huo-Yan in China).
The laboratory, which was launched in 14 days, was able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day and was the first in the world to be so large a laboratory operating outside China.
The different test options for various parts of the genetic profile of Coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German-based test kit for low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sanitary and Epidemiological Centres was not available until 28 January, which led to the absence of testing teams in the United States. In the beginning of China and the United States, there were problems with the confidence of testing teams, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient amounts of the collection recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, as experts believe, extensive testing has helped to reduce the spread of a new corona virus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working on the possibility of testing, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as a better way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing resulting from the rapid spread of the virus, many United States private laboratories, with hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis, were overloaded, and stocks for the collection of meat and chemical reactions were quickly created.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test sets.
The U.S. test kits developed by CDC had “disability” and therefore the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that involved private testing, and Spain obtained testing sets from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these sets were incorrect.
The company explained that the reason for the invalidity of the results could be the failure of the sample collection or the misuse of the collection.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would respond to the lack of results and replace them with other sets of companies, Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the tests that Chechia obtained in China were incorrect. 1.2 million of the tests received by Slovakia in China were also recognized as incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed to release them in Dunei. Atesh Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the tests acquired in China had “high level of errors” and the Ministry “did not use them”. Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but at the beginning of April 2020 it was declared inappropriate for them to be used.
Quarantine measures for those whose analyses had a positive impact on SARS-CoV-2, as well as the monitoring of people with whom such patients had been contacted, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where the first man died from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing of the whole population, involving about 3400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of illness were placed on quarantine.
The entry into the territory of the population was closed, and this measure completely halted the spread of infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore, there was much less pressing than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were canceled, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge the residents to stay home, but schools that completed on 23 March were opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with pandemics through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but their restrictions have been less aggressive.
Statistical research has shown that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to deaths, mortality rates were significantly lower, likely as these countries were able to detect more patients with mild-explained symptoms or symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no mass testing resources, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative analyses to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO control laboratories to confirm the testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the next graph, the ‘positive results’ column will depend on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive effect in the percentages compared to the country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other conditions.
Our hand, also known as a “high hand”, is the process of cleaning hands with a view to eliminating pollution, fever, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
A regular soft hand in certain “critical moments” prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and fever, which are transmitted on a physical or physical basis.
A person may also be affected by respiratory diseases, such as flu or usual pancreas, for example, if it is affected by the eyes, nose or throat (that is, the spleen) by the hands that are not covered.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be washed with milk: before and after the defect, after the child's eggs are hatched, or after the exchange of eggs, before the baby's feeding, before the eggs, and after the preparation or processing of the red meat, fish and poultry.
If water and honey are not available, hands can be cleaned with salt. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Until, in time and after cooking.
Before and after the procedure for treating a sick person.
After a change of underpants or a baby coming into the toilet.
After the ice cream, cheese or tea.
After abstinence to animals, cows or wastes of animal origin.
The medical hygienic hand is related to hygiene related to medical procedures.
Our hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to wash hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing disease), as well as from chemicals that may be harmful or may cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Our hands are very useful for health: for example, it reduces the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infections of the diaries, reduces respiratory infections,
and reduces the level of infant mortality in households.
The 2013 study showed that a more high-quality arm can lead to a minor slow growth of children up to five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheic diseases can be reduced by taking simple customs, such as soft hands with milk.
This elemental procedure is able to reduce mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders on the use of soft hands could reduce the number of cases of diarrhoea by approximately three, and this would be compared to ensuring that regions with low levels of access to clean water.
The reduction in the number of cases of diarrhoea by 48 per cent can be linked to a soft hand with milk. Our arm with milk is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and severe respiratory diseases (ORCs) in order to develop appropriate habits in each home, in schools and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of the ORI, is the main cause of death among children up to five years of age, which affects the life of some 1.8 million children a year.
Diurea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children every year.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that a soft hand in front of and after the toilet, which is becoming a strong habit, can save more lives than any individual vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality of the diaphragm almost two times, and death from severe respiratory infections to four times.
Our hands are usually associated with other health activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Our hand also prevents the occurrence of an impeccable disease that is transmitted directly to the physical contact.
A small negative effect of a common soft hand is that it can lead to skin excrement and, of course, damage to it.
The 2012 data study showed that too many fingers can lead to toothache and skin rash — a disease known as an exam or a hand dermatitis, which is particularly widespread among health workers.
Too often the arm can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCR).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when breast-feeding is important to reduce the risk of physical or physical transmission of the disease: post-retirement (power-dispersion, failure), post-moving the child (change of birth), before the child's breast, before the meal and before/or after the preparation of raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases, when it is necessary to wash your hands in order to prevent the spread of disease: before or after the treatment of a wound or wound, after the sneezing, coughing or sneezing, after the removal of the animal or to the animal, after breast-feeding.
In many countries, hand washing is quite widespread.
The 2015 study on hand mills, which took place in 54 countries, showed that in the middle of 38.7 per cent of households with milk, it was generally accepted. The 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97 per cent, had been established in Saudi Arabia; the United States was close to average, their rate was 77 per cent; the lowest rate was established in China – 23 per cent. There are currently several methods of changing behaviour and developing handmaking in critical situations. In developing countries, the group arming with students is one of the most common tools at this time.
“An emergency medical aid programme”, carried out by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of extensive activities to promote child health and children's education.
The national programme is based on degelminization, which takes place twice a year, as well as a daily wash with milk and a daily brush cleaning.
The same programme has been successfully carried out in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each layer is more effective if the powder is added in the mouth.
The main action of the mill and its assets is to remove barriers to resolution and to improve its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means of cleaning the skin, as the fluids and proteins that are components of organic contamination are badly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
Strong honey may also contain bacteria that may fall on it during previous use.
A small number of studies involving the fall on each of the bacterium surfaces of the infected bone marrow indicate the small probability of such a fall, as bacteria are laughing at the penis.
The CCC still claims that “the hand-twisted Jewelry is a preferred option to wash your hands”.
Antibacterial love is actively announced in health-care communities.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics of their nature.
However, the antibacterial seal contains distributed antibacterial agents, such as triclosant, to which many resistant strains of organisms are sustained.
Thus, even if the strains that sustain antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibacterial honey, their effectiveness may not correspond to the announced.
In addition to the surface-active substance and the means to protect the skin, complex compounds may contain oxylates (excessive, ascorbicin, milk) as regulators, as well as anti-molecular benzoic acid and other wastes (aloe faith, vitamins, mentole, extracts of plants). A complex analysis conducted by the University of Oregon's Public Health School showed that in order to prevent diseases and removal of bacteria with their hands, simple diversity was as effective as normal antibacterial honey containing triclosane.
The hot water of comfort for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria are widely distributed at 37°C.
However, in order to remove natural substances that contain pollution and bacteria, hot cold water is more effective than cold.
Despite the widespread view, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water does not affect the reduction of carbon load on the hands.
The defining instrument for hand (sanitazer) or an antiseptic for hand is a non-water-guided hand.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, the population of gygienic hands was collected on a non-water basis (also known as disinfectives on a spirit basis, antipsychiatry on the disinfection of hands or sanitizers).
Most of these products are produced by an isophyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of contaminants such as carbomers (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel or in the form of glycerin in the liquid or pen, which facilitate the use of these substances and reduce the effect of skin excretion.
Adding the dissolved water supply to further enhance antimicrobial activity. The disincentives that contain at least 60-95 per cent of the spirit are effectively destroying the microbes.
Injectives kill bacteria, including bacteria with multiple drug sustainability (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, renovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and influenza.
The disinfectants containing 70 per cent of the breath kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (a reduction of 3.5 equivalent to 35 decibels) in hands over 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent of bacteria (a reduction of 4 to 5) in hand over 1 minute after application. The disinfectives are most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Antipsychiatric agents are practically ineffective against the virus virus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of the infection of the hoster. A sufficient number of antipsychotics or antipsychotics should be used to treat and treat the skin with both sides closely.
The surface of both ladens, as well as the space between fingers throughout the length, is increased for about 30 seconds until the fluid, penis or gel is fully absorbed.
The fingers on both hands should also be washed carefully, and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you make a choice for your arms rather than for the use of disinfectants, especially if your hands are severely damaged.
The increase in the popularity of such disincentives is due to their simple use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be replaced by a full-scale hand if it is possible to use water and milk.
The frequent use of disinflammable hand-hands may cause skin dryness if they do not contain softer and/or hair-drives.
The effect of hair drying may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other sweeteners to the composition of the product.
In clinical trials, hand-degrading agents, which contain freezing components, caused significantly less dispersion and dryness of skin than sweet or anti-immocratic agents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, connective tissue syndrome or hypersensitiveness to the spirit or additives present in disinfectants are not present in practice.
A lower probability of the occurrence of explosive contact dermatitis has become a factor in the use of the optimizing means compared to milk and water.
Despite its effectiveness, non-water resources do not wash hands from organic substances but simply dissipate them.
For that reason, the disincentives for hands are not as effective as preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as usual, as pathogenic microorganisms are still in their hands when they are used.
The effectiveness of the disinflamming instrument for non-smokers depends significantly on components and composition, and has been historically significantly lower than that of spirit or spirit-containing instruments.
It has recently been shown that the preparations in which Benzalconide chloride is used have stable and cumulative anti-immulgic activity other than that of the breath, which has been shown to have lost effectiveness after multiple use, probably due to progressive side reactions.
Many people in low - income communities are unable to give themselves a taste of it and replace it with gold or silver.
Gold or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than sweet.
One of the problems with this approach is that if the skin or gold are contaminated by microorganisms, it may, on the other hand, increase the spread of disease.
As sweet as honey, gold is a dissipating instrument, as it is formed in the face of water.
If it is not available, WHO recommends using gold or sand as alternative alternatives.
In order to prevent the injury of the Disease Control Centre in the United States, it is recommended to use hand washing technique, including the following steps:
Wash your hands under hot or cold water.
Water is recommended because standing water may be contaminated, and this is how much water does not matter.
Help your hands with a large amount of honey, including the long side of the ladon, as well as the area between your fingers and your feet.
The molluscs are removed from the skin, and studies show that when people use honey (not just one water), they tend to wash their hands more closely.
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
The trend helps to remove the microbes from the skin, and as long as you're a third arm, the more the microbes are removed.
Wash your hands thoroughly under the water.
Washing hands in a steady water can cause a recurrence of injury.
Wash your hands with clean water, or let them lift themselves up.
The soft and soft hands are easily damaged, and the most common people are left without regard for such areas as large arms, legs, arms, and legs.
Artifacts and cuts can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a rinse to prevent skin rash, which may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If water is scarce and honey is not available, there are many different ways to wash your hands: washing water from a high conisterion or bottled tea and/or using salt if necessary, such as in developing countries, where limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries) is available, such as ice cream and other adverse options.
A knife with a knife is a simple structure consisting of an eczema attached to a rope and a knife that should be attached to the handle to water; it should then be used as a hammer.
An effective hand dryer is an integral part of the hygienic process, but there are some conflicts about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of studies show that the storage capacity is much more hygienic than the electric shocks for hands that have been placed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on the Manufacture of Bottles and Birds; this study compared the level of hygienicity of boars, hand dryer with warm air and more modern flow air bubbles for hand.
It was found that the total number of bacteria in the middle of the fingernails increased by 194 per cent and 254 per cent in the lungs after the bite and the drying of the hand in the warm air.
It has also been found that the total number of bacteria on the palms of their fingers is 42 per cent and 15 per cent on the ladone.
After breast-feeding and breast-feeding, the total number of bacteria on the fingernails is reduced to 76 per cent and on the laps up to 77 per cent, and scientists have also carried out tests to determine the possibility of cross-sectional damage to several toilet rooms and toilet facilities in each type of shower.
Air-aircraft, which emits air at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 m/h), is capable of draining micro-organisms from the hand and from its own block and potentially harming other users of the toilet room and satellite in the radius up to 2 metres.
The use of an air-conditioning tool extends micro-organisms in the radius up to 0.25 metres from the suction.
In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt conducted a study on the assessment of different methods of hand drying.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria depending on the dry hand method:
There are many different manufacturers of hand mills, and hand mills are similar to the dry mills.
Washing hands with disinfectants can be an alternative solution during travel when there is no flour and water.
The hand-definanced instrument shall contain at least 60 per cent of the windscreen.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory after the Hungarian doctor Ignat Zemmelweis discovered his high effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the camps.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps reduce the level of injury.
The medical wash will take at least 15 seconds, with a large amount of flour, water or gel used to wash and control each part of the hand.
The hands should be carefully attached to each other, raising their arms.
If there's a bug under the legs, it can be used to get rid of it.
Since microbes can stay in the water that is present in their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them out of our mouth with clean sand.
After the drying of the hand, the closing of the skull and, if necessary, the closing and opening of any door, the storage capacity should be used.
This helps to prevent the re-ignition of hands from these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in medical institutions is to eliminate and prevent the spread of pathogenic microorganisms (microbes).
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the oral procedure remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they are given to patients and thus spread microorganisms.
As a result of one study, proper hand-to-hand and other essential procedures may reduce the level of cancer-related infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a paper on the standard washing and handling of hands that should be applied in the health sector.
The WHO manual on hygiene is also available on its website and will open for public discussion.
The corresponding review was conducted in Whitby.
Where it is necessary to confirm compliance with the regulatory requirements, commercial devices may be used for measuring indicators and checking hygiene.
The World Health Organization designates “five moments” when it is necessary to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
Before use of antipsychotics, as well as
After treatment with a patient, adding antipsychiatry chemicals to the mouth by hand (the “medical” or “anti-bibonic”) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before performing surgical operations or in the environment with high levels of organisms resistant to antibiotics. For the “cleaning” hand before surgery, a cancer is required that may be included and excluded without touching its hands; and a little chlorogexedin or iodine water should also be used to wash hands, sterile hands for drying after the eye, sterile for training and another sterile tool for cleaning under the legs.
All seizures must be removed.
This procedure usually takes 2-6 minutes to wash your hands and towels.
There's no need to hold hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During the dry season, water with sprays should not fall back on the dry hands.
After the surgery, the hands dry out the sterile tissue and hope for a surgical Halat.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after treatment for a sick person.
In order to combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefit of breast cancer was the first 20 per cent of breast cancer, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of breast cancer was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the antibacterial powder, the oral powder is more than tripled to increase the rate of bacterial infections transmitted through the food. The proportion of the oral oral solution and the oral antibacterial powder is reduced by about 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the treatment of the oral solution reduced the bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to the antibacterial milk.
However, honey and water are more effective than hand-to-hand hand-to-hand sprays, in order to reduce the number of influenza A H1N1 virus and to combat Clostridium difficile. Hand development activities in medical institutions can include training of hand-to-hand personnel, improving the availability of hand-to-hand sprayers, as well as written and oral reminders of the need to wash hands.
Further studies on the most effective types of measures are required in various health institutions.
In developing countries, breast-feeding is recognized as an economically effective and important means of improving health and even nutrition.
However, the lack of stable water, furniture or tools to wash your hands at home, in schools and at work makes it difficult to wash your hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not far from each private or public hall, there are cuts to wash hands, although there are many ways to organize wash hands in such places.
However, a lack of hygiene may also be caused by contaminated habits, not by lack of soil or water.
The promotion and promotion of blind hands can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefit of blind hands, and bring about long-term changes in the conduct of the people.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results must be carried out.
In a systematic analysis of 70 studies, it was found that, in order to improve the situation with a hygienic hand in countries with lower income levels, effective community-level sanitation and epidemiological supervision is less effective than public marketing campaigns. One example of the propaganda on handing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's “Three Star Approach” approach: it promotes the realization of simple economic measures that stimulate the hands of students with love, as well as the implementation of other hygienic requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can improve their level from one to three stars.
The installation of gynaecologists is one of the possible measures implemented in the information campaigns on gynaecology to reduce disease and child mortality.
The World Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20-year-old Korean virus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund continues to use hand-significant emeds.
Some studies have considered the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the DALYs (safety-life-free years).
However, one study suggests that the promotion of breast-feeding is a much more economic solution compared to other health measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized by the 19th century by two gynecologists: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), English nurse, and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the same time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by violent floods called miasamas.
In the 1980s, due to the outbreaks of diseases spread through the food tract and health-related infections, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States has become more active in promoting a hygienic hand, such as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of how important it is to wash hands with milk to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, a number of manuals in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airports have been broadcast with “right hand-held techniques”.
The phrase “smoothing hands” means a refusal to take responsibility for anything or to be a participant.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “took his hands ” when he decided to stop Jesus Christ; later this phrase became widely used in some English communities.
In the Song of Macbeth, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth is not allowed to wash his hands in an attempt to clean up the thought of a guilty conscience, because of the crimes she committed herself and prompted her husband to do.
It has also been established that people who remember or observe any non-ethical conduct tend to wash their hands more often than others and that they are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” compensating activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religion, it has a hygienic purpose as well as a symbolic meaning. The symbolic wash of the hands of water, but without milk, is part of the rituals prescribed in many religions, including Bahahisism, Indusism, Tevilah and netitat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also prescribes hygienic washing hands, especially after certain actions.
India, Judaism, and Islam are obliged to wash their hands after visiting the toilet.
In India, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash your hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors related to COVID-19
Control of productive factors with regard to COVID-19 implies the use of a working safety and health method to control the risk and combat the 2019 coroner virus (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk control at the workplace depends on the location and task, based on the assessment of risks, the seriousness of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Department of Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that jobs at the lower level had minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and that, in such cases, basic measures were required to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home with signs of disease, compliance with the respiratory label, and day-to-day training and work disability.
Average risk responsibilities require partial or close contact with persons who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 but are likely to be affected by the current spread of disease in society or in international travel.
This category can be addressed by public workers, such as schools, the high-level working environment and some large-scale retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include the use of high-efficiency air filters, the use of protective screens and access to personal protection in contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health institutions and seafarers who contact a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are at a high risk category; thus, the risk is increased to a high level when conducting such aerosol education procedures or collecting/processing samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures for such personnel include the use of engineering and technical security equipment, such as ventilating rooms with negative pressure, as well as the protection of personnel suitable for the purpose.
The COVID-19 shock can give different types of impact on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to their own illness, the need for care of others or the fear of possible injury.
Commercial patterns can be changed in respect of both the types of goods on which such goods are requested and the ways in which they are purchased (e.g. purchases in non-pegic periods with delivery or service, not from the machine).
Finally, it is possible to check the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. In the organization of protection, a plan can be used to ensure the preparedness of the epidemic and to carry out the response.
The plans address the risks associated with different workplaces and tasks, including injury sources, risk factors arising from home and community and risk factors for individual workers, such as ageing or chronic diseases.
The plans also provide the means of monitoring necessary to address such risks as well as plans of emergency action for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans to prepare for and respond to the epidemic may be followed by recommendations at the national or state level.
Some of the objectives of ensuring response to the epidemic are: reducing the spread of virus among personnel, protecting people at a higher risk of serious health problems, maintaining business operations and minimizing negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses affect the severity of the disease in the community where business is located.
Risk control equipment is a structure widely used to ensure safety and hygiene of work, for the purpose of grouping such funds in terms of efficiency.
When the risk of COVID-19 disease cannot be resolved, the most effective engineering and technical means are then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
The engineering and technical means of security mean the isolation of workers from workplace risks and are not dependent on the behaviour of the worker, which may be the most economically beneficial solution.
Administrative measures require changes in the working policies or procedures required by the employee or staff member.
Staff protection (PEP) is considered less effective than technical or administrative measures, but may help to address some risks.
All types of personal protection should be selected, depending on the threat to the worker, appropriate size (e.g. respiratorys), use regularly and properly, regularly, to check, maintain and replace as necessary, as well as to be taken, cleaned and stored or maintained in order to avoid injury.
The Office of the United States Office for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) considers that the minimum risk posts are in contact with the public and its colleagues.
The basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include, in part and in a thorough manner, recommendations for disabled workers to stay at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including the closing of the hand in the neck and shoulders, the provision of toilets and containers for the mouse, the readiness to move or to change work, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons who are potentially affected is a critical step towards the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others at work.
The United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that patients with severe respiratory diseases stay at home until the end of the year, the absence of increased body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medications or other medicines that cure symptoms, and also prescribes flexibility in hospital policies, permits staff to stay home for care for a sick family member and to provide information on such policies.
According to OSHA, high-risk positions require partial and close contacts with persons with no more than six feet (1.8 m) of confirmed data or suspected of COVID-19 but are likely to damage SARS-COV-2 due to the spread of disease in a community in the territory where business is located, or the recent visits of such a person at the COVID-19 site.
Such categories include workers who have contacts in contact with the public, for example, in schools, working environments with high population, and some of the large variety of businesses in the public sector and some large variety of businesses, and in engineering and technical security equipment for such groups and high-risk groups, including high risk risk groups, high efficiency of high-efficient air filters, high air air filters, increased ventilation intensity, physical ventilation, physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protection screens, and high plastic protection screens, and mountings for clients without leaving out of the car. Administrative measures for these groups and equipment for those groups, technical safety measures for those groups and groups with high risk groups, including high- risk groups for such categories of

In rare cases, workers from such a group may be required to carry reflectors.
If a person is ill in the aircraft, such measures as the isolation of a sick person from other people at 6 feet away, the appointment of a crew member for the care of a sick person, the provision of a painful mask or treatment to such a person with a request to cover his or her nose and mouth with a knife or a knife.
Double-sized crew members must carry one-off medical care when approaching a sick passenger or when compared with physical fluids or potential infected surfaces and may be additional personal protection if they have a sick wound, regular cough or respiratory difficulties.
In the case of commercial navigation, including cross-border and other passenger ships, the safety measures involved the restoration of travel in the event of disease, self-insolation and immediately informing the medical centre of the ship when there are noise or other symptoms on board.
In an ideal, medical examination should be carried out in an isolated cage of such a person. In the case of schools and child care institutions, CDC recommends short-term closures for treatment or disinfection if the infected person is in school building, regardless of the prevalence of disease in the community.
In the presence of a minimum or average level of infection in the community, social distance strategies such as removal of exits for personal meetings, assemblies and other mass activities, such as the use of physiculo- or red wine, the adoption of coffee, the increase in time between parties, the rule of time of arrival and treatment, the limitation of unnecessary visits, the use of a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
In addition to social exclusion strategies, measures can be considered long-term visits to schools at large levels, and the direct health risk is considered to be low in the opinion of CDC for law enforcement officers carrying out daily duties.
Law enforcement officers who are obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same instructions as are prescribed for rapid assistance to refugees, including the use of appropriate personnel protection.
In the absence of close contact, workers must clean up and dissipate their formal routines and cycirculators prior to re-use by domestic clean aerosols or by preventing them, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and tolligate the use of personal protective equipment, as well as the use and disposal of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and maritime workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel, who contact patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
They have a very high risk of injury when conducting aerosol education procedures or when collecting/processing samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
Aerosol education procedures include fusion, cassette, bronchoscopy, some stomatological procedures and surveys or sampling of invasive methods.
High-risk seafarers are involved in the processing of the bodies of persons with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such personnel are in hiding, they are at a high risk. Additional engineering and safety facilities for such groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including in the conduct of procedures for aerosol education.
In some health and marine institutions, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure can be effective.
Efforts should be made to comply with the precautionary measures provided for at the biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be divided into restricted waiting zones, depending on the presence of suspects at COVID-19. In addition to other means of personal protection, OSHA recommends the use of respirators with up to 6 foot of patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 as well as those conducting aerosol education procedures.
In the United States, approved N95 or higher-class NIOSH respirators should be used within the framework of an integrated written programme for respirator protection, which sets out requirements for individual fundraising and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratorys can provide more effective protection and comfort to the staff. WHO does not recommend using specialized care, since COVID-19 is a disease transmitted to the respiratory, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the patient reception point.
The WHO recommends that people who collect samples from respiratory pathways in patients with COVID-19 or carriers of this disease without aerosol education procedures carry a surgical mask, protect glasses or a protective screen for individuals, horses and dogs.
In the course of procedures for aerosol education, a N95 or FFP2 should be replaced by a surgical mask.
In view of the insufficient availability of individual protection funds worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protection through the use of remote medical facilities, physical barriers, such transparent glasses, access to the patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide immediate care, the use of the personal protection funds necessary for the specific task, the continued use of one of the same inspectors, without reducing, in working with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and non-smokers.

COVER: [Covit-19] Facilitation of loading and preparation for the future
Date/Time: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DESCRIPTION: CC0: Protection rights are missing
In this month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the relationship between people all over the world and our responsibility to each other.
We had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to feel, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is based on such an organization.
We have observed friendly and concerned relations among all our colleagues, which have been reflected in the electronic listing, calls and chats — a remarkable proof of the fact that, fortunately, people work with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the high estimate of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to reach Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have access to this key resource online.
And this may be due to your work, whether it is to ensure the employability of websites, to pay to our colleagues or to protect the security of the community.
Peace needs information presented in Wikipedia, and it is more important today than ever before.
In order to achieve significant results for the world, it is important not only what we do but also how we do it.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in our joint work, starting with the following week.
Correcting our work schedules and schedules
As noted earlier by Robin, the c-team team gathered yesterday to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In the course of the community, we have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
Most of us wanted to overcome the pressure and support our long - term mission.
If you want to quit, let's do it.
For all staff, contractors and staff:
According to our expectations, it is necessary to work around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the next round.
We do not announce the dates of departure: if you can work properly for more hours, this will be allowed for our mission.
But now we do not expect the world to know; no matter what your needs are, whether it is for family, food, or medical attention, your welfare is our priority.
We're not following your work time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
That's understandable and unambiguous, but we're talking about it.
There is no need to draw up a letter or a reply: just inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and schedule of work to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, please inform Brian of the T&C Ops Unit so that T&C can provide support and proper attention to your situation).
The payment of interest rates will be made in full.
We have already declared and confirmed our intention to fulfil our obligations to our contractors and staff with respect to the payment rate.
Each person shall be paid in accordance with the normal interest rates applied under normal circumstances.
This means, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use their efforts to reach the world around us.
What we do can produce wonderful results, especially at such times.
And again, it's about self-help.
We invite you to talk to our guide so that we can know what to expect and be able to correct our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (other than others) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We initiate the process for all units to assess the current objectives and focus on providing support that is very important to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most important projects.
The delay today does not have a negative impact on the future.
We are not planning to work “two more to reverse the missed” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work too long to comply with the unrealistic deadlines for the present time.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and deadlines, as far as possible.
What happens to the APP (annual plans)?
In order to adjust to the new reality and expectations of the daily working time, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the deadlines for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and close care, and, in addition, to all who need or want to work, a reduced schedule will be provided for the next few weeks.
Such extension of time significantly reduces the current load on planning and pressure throughout the organization.
The following week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, the representatives and the teams, as soon as possible after receipt of the relevant confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for the lead role in this work.
Status of office, risk and training
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with COVID-19.
However, in addition to many precautionary measures, we have commissioned an anti-fraud training team to dissipate all surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus health-class solutions to dissipate all surfaces, as well as for acceptable and elevators, through which access to our roofs can be obtained.
The buildings shall apply their own rules of compliance with the precautionary rules with the use of products that ensure the safety of their contractors.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the area of Colombia (DC) is located on the WebWork network, which has been shared with us and with all the staff in the DC, its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the area of Colombia was completely transferred to remote work in accordance with instructions made in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York know, we have also discussed the rent in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working very hard first.
Our older colleagues, who are working away, know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that the duration of the meetings be limited to one-two hours.
In the case of longer sessions, consider the possibility of breaking them into a course of several days.
Set out thoroughly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and forward the information.
Use videos to facilitate interaction and communication, such as Google Docs and Zoom.
To facilitate the appointment of a coordinator — a person who will monitor the arrival of issues in the classroom and control the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for handling notes (or joint inspection).
If appropriate, seek technical support by e-mail.
Enjoy your benefits on the Wellness Reimbursement program when you buy breakfast.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work.
The HR Operations team is studying the guidance on horgonomics available in the form of web sites to facilitate the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all the beneficiaries of the community to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons", until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such derogations and other restrictions may result in the inability to carry out agreed activities on the border, and no one will be harmed by the delay or change of such objectives.
In the coming week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional instructions on Wikimania as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The overall trend in the global community is not only a shock at the cessation of work but also a sense of ease in terms of understanding and the possibility of focusing on their own communities, Wikimedia and not just on their own.
With regard to the prospect, the CRT works on the Meta-Wiki website, which provides space for communities that can monitor the impact and the community.
We remain in contact with issues related to COVID-19
We will send you an invitation to a special staff meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we use the opportunity to share more information, to answer your questions, and to spend time with each other.
We are ready to help as much as we can in this situation.
You can still get information from such an electronic review, while other important information about COVID-19 is from Office Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working on maintaining regular communications with staff living in countries that have significantly affected the current situation.
In the case of travel, activities, key labour flows, information disclosure problems or, if necessary, contact the CRT.
We are ready to support and provide the necessary links.
If there are confidential issues, please contact Brian Juden, Director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such changes should be considered as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible need to adapt our work and obligations to the cardinality of the present.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to ensure that we continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary services.
Our plan will wait until the time is right.
It is now time to support each other and create space for important work that will take place in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families, as well as to work with the maximum wage, as soon as such needs are met.
Now, please, help your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-transforming plant 2 (ACE2) is a plant attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the light, arteries, heart, lungs, and oxygen.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of the relevant angiotensin-transpersing plant (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of heart disease. AC2 also serves as an entry point for some coronary viruses.
The human version of the farm is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-transverting plant 2 is a zinc-containing metal plant located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 label contains the N-concentive peptidase domain M2 and C-concentive transport domain of the renal amino acid complex.
ACE2 represents a single-step membrane of type I, its farmable active domain falls on the surface of light cells and other tissues.
The ACE2 single domain is derived from the trans-membrowed domain by other farms known as sheddes, and the soluble protein is released in the bloodstream and finally obtained by force.
ACE2 is present in most bodies: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most of the light type II alveolar cells, the enterocytes of the thin tissue, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the smooth muscle cells of the majority of the organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 and RNCs are also found in the core of the brain, striatum, hypothalamus and brain structure.
The key function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE opponent.
ACE destroys angiotensin I hormone in co-existing angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, inhibits the carboxylic amino acid phenylamine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into a vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also damage a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bracidin, apeline, neurotensin, diniorphine A and ethylene.
ACE2 also regulates the memory transport of the transporter of SLC6A19 neutral amino acids and is present in Hartnupa's disease.
As a trans-membrained white, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for certain coronary viruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus.
Strongly speaking, the link of white S1 to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 plant domain on the surface of the cell leads to endocitosis and transmission of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomal in the cells.
This process of entry also requires the elimination of white S of the TMPRSS2 serial procedure, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, which has led some to believe that lowering ACE2 in cells can help to combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend that standard therapy be continued by AFP and BRA inhibitors.
According to the systematic review and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of AFP inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving APH inhibitors who have been at higher risk, pneumonia disease, particularly in patients with insulin and heart failure.
The use of AFP inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients with overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novelty in the treatment of severe mild wounds and is likely to improve mild hemodynamics and oxygen in the development of a severe respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysariads.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours, and the start of action is 30 minutes, except for the duration of the impact at 24 hours.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 may be a promising means for people with chronic renal angiotensin-inhibitors (RAS) or in patients with advanced angiotensin-II circulation. The rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of acute respiratory depression syndrome.
The COVID-19 annexes are software applications for mobile phones intended for epidemiological research under the 2019-20-year-old Coronavirus pandemic, which can be identified by individuals ('Contacts') who could contact an infected person.
In some regions, many of the annexes officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options for monitoring contacts have been developed.
This led to a discussion of confidentiality issues, particularly with regard to systems based on the geographical location of the users of the applications.
More softer options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to register the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate their support functions on the basis of Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Aragawa, issued an annex that would enable citizens to verify whether they were associated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities and is used in Singapore under the name TraceTogether.
The annex was developed by local IT companies, with an open source code and will be transmitted under the control of the Government. North Macedonia launched the “StopKorona” application on Bluetooth, helping to monitor contacts with potential infected people and provide operational contact with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the annex was expected to be registered in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking facility was at the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand consider using the applications on the basis of the TraceTogether and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use the application using the geosonization function to ensure that patients with the COVID-19 diagnosis living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security, Cambridge University, identified a number of potential practical problems that could arise with systems on the basis of applications, including false processing and potential ineffectiveness in the use of only a small part of the population.
In view of the concern about the proliferation of corrupt or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could offer its facilities related to the Corona virus in the App Store, including only “official” or other trust organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
The participants expressed concern about the impact of mass monitoring on the population through the annexes to the Corona virus; in particular, the question was raised whether the monitoring infrastructure created to combat the pandemic of the Coronavirus would be demonstrated when the threat disappeared.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement calling for such supervision.
The organizations announced eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring shall be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by reservations on the limitation of the duration of action;
The use of data should be limited to combating the spread of COVID-19;
The safety and anonymity of data should be protected and evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital monitoring should exclude cases of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties shall be determined at the legislative level;
Protection from abuses and the right of citizens to respond to abuses should be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists.
Google and Apple have proposed their joint plan to address the issue of permanent monitoring, which is to remove the monitoring mechanism from their operating systems as soon as necessary.
In some countries, instead of the annexes, a network monitoring of the location is used, which excludes the need to load the application and avoid traceability.
A network monitoring was approved in Israel.
The network decisions that have access to the source data on the location also have major potential issues with confidentiality.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal data on the location; a number of systems have been developed with confidentiality, which are used only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a system not used as a basis for monitoring contacts was used.
Instead of using a special annex, the system collected trace information from different sources, including data on tracking mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages sent to potential infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected persons but also provided information on the location of the public access, which was possible because of significant changes to the law on the protection of information that had been introduced after the outbreak of the MercS in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through several applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider the possibility of using both centralised and confidential systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details were not yet made available.
The follow-up of contacts with confidentiality is a concept that has a significant amount of research literature at least for 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on confidential decisions such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the user's approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralised and decentralised approaches and are not the only protocol. Decentralised protocols include decentralised confidentiality tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile communications tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for never leaving the device and all comparisons have been made to it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is engaged in the development of SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality when collecting and using location data or crossing ways to track COVID-19 distribution.
The work of this platform is based on the studies presented in the “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic”, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that has developed confidentiality technology, which was also originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable equipment that allows users to exchange confidential data on location and health with other users and officials without risking confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were founded by the TCN Global Coalition, which aims to reduce fragmentation and ensure the global compatibility of applications for monitoring and reporting, which is the key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control the work of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts that, as they claimed, will ensure confidentiality and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that will enable them to maintain confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of key technologies used in the work of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system must be deployed in three stages:
Dispersion of tools to enable Governments to establish official facilities for monitoring the movement of infected coral virus by citizens, but with the maintenance of data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple, they plan to deal with the problems with continuous monitoring, first introduced the system by updating the operating system, and then eliminated it after the threat disappeared.
Repositioning a medicinal product (also known as reproducating, redirecting, changing tasks or therapeutic transfer) is a reproducating approved medicinal product for the purpose of treating disease or medical condition other than the disease, which is intended to be developed.
This is one of the scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective ways of treating COVID-19.
Other aspects of the study include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 proteins that affect medicinal products, each containing several ligaments.
The analysis of these related sites serves as an appropriate basis for the development of an effective anti-virus preparation against whites COVID-19.

WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international "Solidity" test.
Remdesivir was created and developed Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus infections. Later, Gilead Sciences officials found that the remedeivir has anti-virus activity in vitro with respect to many philosophiles, pneumos, paramixes and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and transfer.
Some early preliminary studies have shown that reddesir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. A number of clinical trials are currently being conducted, including two of the university clinics in Cleveland; one is conducted in patients with moderate form of disease; and the other, in patients with a more severe form.
Three clinical trials are currently being conducted on the topic of intramuscular administration of vitamin C for people who have been hospitalised with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).

The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such vaccines continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it is not expected that the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will be received earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020 the outbreak of this disease spread worldwide, leading to significant investments in the development of vaccines and research related to it.
Many organizations are using published genes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, wide deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020 there were 10 different technological platforms to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I security studies:
Nuclear oxygen (NNC and RNC) ( Stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNC-1273)
virus vector (type I manufacturer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in early stages of development, 78 are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milkena Institute); 37 more vaccines have been reported, but few information is available (proposally available at planning or development).
Early safety and immunogenicity testing is carried out at stages I-II, usually performed in a randomized, placebo-controlled and several locations with a more accurate and effective dose definition.
Phase III of the trials usually includes more participants, including the control group; at this stage, preparations are tested to be effective in the prevention of disease and at the same time follow-up side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (assisted at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not undergone human trials (are still in clinical trials).

In March 2020, the Government, industry and three universities of the United States have merged the resources of IBM supercomputers in conjunction with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, as well as so-called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages besides their ability to prevent diseases.
Another randomized study conducted in Australia involves 4170 health workers.
The vaccines developed may be dangerous or ineffective.
Early studies on the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models, such as COVID-19, ACE2-transgenous mice, other laboratory animals and low strains, indicate the need for measures to prevent infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standard safety procedures.
Victims against SARS and MERS were protested on animal models.
As of 2020, SARS has no medicinal or protective vaccine to be safe and effective for humans.
According to the research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions worldwide.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the SARS study, which was conducted at the time, could be the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents against the infection of MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS, which passed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on the virus vector and were in the process of developing two adhesion (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social networks have spread the theory of conspiracy, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not new, and that it already exists.
The social networks cited the words of some patients who claimed to have patents on the genetic traceability of other cancer strains such as SARS and vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) that is a disease caused by severe severe respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include leukemia, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include the feeling of old age, muscle pain, diarrhoea, pain in the throat, loss of consciousness and pain in life.
The time from the first occurrence of symptoms to the outbreak of disease usually consists of about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are associated with mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease is due to viral pneumonia and polyurethane deficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of injury have been recorded in 210 countries and regions and more than 153,000 people have been killed.
More than 568,000 people were injured, mainly when they were in close contact with each other, often through microscopic caps, which were distributed in the air in the case of coughing, teasing or talking.
Although these capillaries are formed at exits, they usually pose a threat that falls on the ground or on the surface but are not transferred through the air to large distances.
People are also affected by a damaged surface and then by their eyes, nose or face.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most affected during the first three days after symptoms occur, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms occur and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymeric core reaction with reverse transcription in real-time (RT-PCR) on an example taken as a bone marrow.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients suspected of illness and for those who suffer from them.
The recommendations for the use of medical masks vary: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, others recommend their use, and others require them.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment from the COVID-19 virus.
Local spread of disease has been registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may not have symptoms or symptoms of flu, such as lyophilisate, casserole, hypertension, and osteoporosis.
Extraordinary symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling chest pain, constipation, difficulty in awakening, death or loss; if the above symptoms occur, medical assistance should be immediately sought.
Reactions can be observed with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections such as nausea, vomiting, or pain in the throat.
Also, in different percentages, there are cold-kissed symptoms such as fever, fever and diarrhoea.
Some cases of diseases recorded in China were marked only by a feeling of depression in the heart and heart failure.
In some cases, disease may progress through pneumonia, polyurethane deficiency, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period usually consists of five-six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5%, symptoms begin to occur within 11.5 days of injury, and according to the data available, symptoms are not available to all infected people.
The role of such unsympathetic carriers in the transmission of disease is still unknown, but preliminary data show that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of infected people with non-sympathic disease is currently unknown; while the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus were non-sympathetic.
The National Health Commission of China has begun to include unsympathetic cases in its daily summary dated 1 April; of the 166 cases of injuries recorded on that day, 130 (78 per cent) were rejected at the time of testing.
And the molluscs, and the fibers can have a higher concentration of the virus.
The sound of the words in the air is more capillary than the sound of normal noise.
A study in Singapore showed that capillary can be extended to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Science has suggested that the transmission of the component of the virus by bioaerosol is still possible and the testing of the air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside the rooms of people has shown the presence of the virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac and cardiac resuscitation (SDRs), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and consequently to the spread of viruses in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through the phecals, but this risk is considered to be low. The virus is the most contagious when people experience symptoms; the spread of the virus may be even before symptoms occur, but the risk is small.
European Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) claims that until it is clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one of the most common infections affects 2 to 3 others.
In particular, it was found that the virus was able to live on a maple surface for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a management table (AISI 304) — up to three days, and on 99 per cent of dry surfaces — up to 4 hours.
However, these indicators vary according to humidity and temperature.
In good use, honey and other resources have a beneficial effect on the prevention of injury: honey destroys the life-protection layer of the virus by deactivating it and by enabling it to be removed from the surface of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as Benzalconic chloride and Chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus, and during a study conducted in Hong Kong, samples were taken in the middle two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest blood level of the virus and in the sixth patient the highest blood level of the virus was found on the second day of testing.
The heavy respiratory respiration syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new heavy respiratory respiration syndrome first discovered in three people with pneumonia from the group with severe respiratory diseases registered in Ohana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also met in the natural habitat of the coral virus.
There is a human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic cold that covers its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
Easy is the body, which is the most affected by COVID-19, because the virus penetrates into cells through angiotensin-transforming plant 2 (ACE2), which is the most widely distributed in the alveolar cells of type II.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates into the oxygen cell using a natural surface glycoprotein, a “sip” (peplomer).
There were 12 per cent of infected people in the Hughan hospital with severe myocardial injury, which was most frequently encountered in severe form of disease.
Most of the heart-coordinated symptoms are high due to systemic exposure and immunological disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but severe myocardial injury may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they participate in the work of this body.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31 per cent) and viral thromboembolism (25 per cent) were observed in patients with COVID-19 who could testify to adverse forecasts.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to ACE2-expressive epithelial cells of respiratory tract, COVID-19 is observed in patients with severe COVID-19 systemic hypersuppression symptoms.
In particular, it was found that the GM-CSF T-cells correlate with the recruitment of IL-6 explosive monocytes and heavy pathology in patients with COVID-19.
The lymphocytes have also been detected at the time of inclusion.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
Polymeric cell reaction in real-time (RT-PCR) is the standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the nose, but can also be used as a nose or mollusc.
The results are usually ready for a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be performed, but they require two samples of blood taken with the interval of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to establish the root virus strain and publish its genetic consistency so that scientists in global laboratories can develop self-tests by a polymeric cell response (PCR) method to identify the presence of this virus.
As of 4 April 2020, tests on antibodies that could identify infection at the present time, as well as the possible injury in the past, were in progress, but have not yet been widely disseminated.
The Chinese study of the results of the tests showed that their accuracy was between 60 and 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the Office for the Control of the Quality of Food Products and Medicinal Products of the United States (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test and authorized its application at the end of this month.
The two-fold multidominated sub-plevelopment focusses on the type of matato glass with peripheral, asymmetric and austeroral distribution are part of the symptoms identified at the early stage of disease.
Subpleural domination, the symptom of the bulimic bridge (including the overheating of a change of alveoliary filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic damages and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study carried out on completion:
Macroscopic: Pleaviritis, pericarditis, vomiting and painkiller
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Easy form of pneumonia: father of mild pneumonia, hyperplasia of pneumonia, major atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation of lymphocyte infiltration and multidimensional giant cells
A severe form of pneumonia: diffusion of alveoliar (DAD) with a diffusion of alveolar exodus.
DAD is a cause of rapid respiratory depression syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxaemia.
Living pneumonics: organization of exodus in the alveoliary fields and light interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffusion of the inner-syndrome (DVS-Syndrum); lycoyotebrolastic reaction
Proprietary measures to reduce the risk of injury include homelessness, the absence of human places, often washed hands with milk and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene rules, and avoid injuries to the eyes, nose or mouth.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose cover the mouth and nose with a knife or schizophrenia, or, in the absence of a couch, close the mouth and the nose of the inner edge of the armpit area.
It is recommended that a quality hygienic procedure be carried out for the hands after the injection or injection.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public places, in particular with a view to limiting the transmission of infections to people with non-sympathetic diseases. Social exclusion strategies are aimed at reducing contact with infected patients with large groups of people; schools and businesses have been closed up, the movement of civilians and major public activities have been reduced.
The remotement recommendations also suggest that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart from each other.
There is no confirmed efficacy against COVID-19, since the completion of the vaccine is not expected until 2021, most of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are due to a reduction in the incidence of an epidemic known as “excessment”.
CDC also recommends more wash hands with milk and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with a severe injection of the hand, as well as before and after breast-feeding, cough or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of a dissipation-containing (at least 60 per cent) hand processing device, but only when it is not available. For regions where such dissipation is not sold, WHO provides two local production recipes.
These components include ethanol or isopropanols that have an antimicrobial activity.
The water flow is used to resolve bacterial disputes in the back and is not a suitable means of antiseptic treatment.
Glycerol is added as a carrier.
Patients have been shown to support therapy that may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and other life-threatening organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that the virus is infected carry a normal medical mask.
The extra-corresponding oxidation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Immunities are recommended to comply with the rules of personal hygiene, the health of life and diet.
Supporting therapy may be demonstrated in patients with mild symptoms at early stages of disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for care for patients treated with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy and pulmonologists have collected recommendations from various institutions in the free resources of IBCC.
As of April 2020, there was no specific treatment with COVID-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as preparations for the first line, some medical personnel recommend that a choice be made for paracetamol (acetamine) compared to ibuprofen.
In carrying out procedures during which air-capital emissions such as intubation or dry hands may occur, precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical institutions.
The CDC recommends that medical personnel with COVID-19 be placed in the air-capable insulator (AIIR) — an additional measure other than the standard precautionary measures in contact and air. The CDC issued recommendations on the use of individual protective equipment (SIZ) during the pandemic.
The recommended individual protective means: the protective helmet, the respiratory or the medical mask, the eye protection device and the medical seal; the above means are preferable to use the respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators were approved for industrial use, but FDA authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the exclusive authorisation (EUA).
They are intended to protect from particles in the air, such as dust, but they are not guaranteed to protect from a specific biological agent when not using instructions.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends using protective personal screens or, at least, to make masks on its own under domestic conditions.
In most cases COVID-19 is not too heavy to require an artificial ventilation or alternative, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, while there are some evidence that intubition can be avoided by a nose oxygen channel with an intense air flow or double-level positive pressure in the respiratory tract.
It is still unknown whether any of these two methods for patients in critical conditions are as effective as IVL.
Some doctors choose for the benefit of invasive mechanical ventilation, if available, because this method significantly restricts the distribution of particles in the air compared to the nose canules with the intense air flow. The risk of severe disease for elderly people (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age) is high.
In many developed countries, health systems do not have hospitals on the heart of the population, and health resources are being too limited to deal with the rapid increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in the form of severe hospitalization.
According to a study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy, 2.3 per cent were required for mechanical support for light ventilation, and 1.4 per cent were completed.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually fall into resuscitation.
The task of providing artificial ventilation is difficult because severe respiratory dystrophy syndrome (ARDS) developed by COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming increasingly difficult.
IVL, with the support of the pressure on the breath and the PPC, is needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen in the light and to minimize the damage to the ventilation that can result in the development of pneumotorace.
In the earlier models of high-voltage fans, high-voltage WFPs may not be available.
The study of potential treatment methods began in January 2020, and a number of anti-virus preparations are currently under clinical testing.
The best prospectus is the rhedeswier.
The development of new medicinal products may take up to 2021, but some of the tested products have already been approved for other purposes or are in the latest stages of testing.
Antiviral preparations can be tested in patients with severe forms of disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers participate in the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to use reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where human life poses a serious or immediate risk.
It was not applied to clinical studies that should be carried out to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to combat the outbreak of disease.
To enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The annex may detect “close contact” using observation data and therefore identify potential risk of injury.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is identified, the application not only recommends self-insolation but also sends a notification to local health authorities. The analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, the technology of identification of people, the tracking of mobile phones and the artificial intelligence is used to monitor infected people and those they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security authorities to monitor the data on mobile phones of people who were suspected of being infected with the virus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may be in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of Deutsche Telekom, the federal government agencies of Germany and the Institute of Robert Koha provided aggregated data on the location of hundreds of subscribers.
In Russia, identification technology was introduced to identify perpetrators of carantin.
The Regional Health Officer of Italy, Julius Gallera, said that hundreds of network operators reported that “40 per cent of people continue to move to the territory at the same time”.
The Government of Germany has held a 48-hour morning program day, involving more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Kalulayed, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the Coronavirus.
People may experience stress related to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Strengthening social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic downturn are the ideal conditions for harming mental health and well-being. ”
The disease may occur in a light form with minor or absent symptoms that remind other spread of upper respiratory diseases, such as a common spleen.
Patients with a mild form of disease usually get exacerbated for two weeks while patients with severe or critical forms may be required from three to six weeks.
pregnant women may be at a higher risk of receiving a heavy form of COVID-19 on the basis of data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although there are no such data on COVID-19. Some people can easily express COVID-19 and cause pneumonia as complications.
Those with the most severe disease COVID-19 may progress rapidly in severe respiratory dystrophy syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyurethane failure.
The COVID-19 complications include sepsis, anomaly thrombosis, as well as heart problems, chest and chest pain.
Thrombocytic anomalies, particularly the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6 per cent of patients in the COVID-19 hospital, while a 4 per cent of the group was monitored for the breach of function.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have increased oil (transsomination).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
According to the early stages of disease, the average time from the initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a total range of between six and 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission for China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent among women.
Histopathological studies of mild deaths indicate diffusion of alveolar with cell fibromyxoid exodus in both.
A viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
An external type of light was recalled by the sharp respiratory syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems resulted in an increase of troponic or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had prior health problems, and access to health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
The mortality estimates vary because of these regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequacies in the light form can lead to a higher level of mortality.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current level of death is underestimated.
The severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally 1.4 times more frequent, and about 2.4 times more patients were required in intensive therapy or died compared to non-smokers, and long-term effects were feared.
The administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had suffered from this disease were reduced by 20 to 30 per cent and their scans were damaged.
This may also lead to the “Intensive Therapy Post” syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether permanent immunity against it is being developed in patients who have been infected with the virus.
The Court of Justice of Other Corona Viruses considered this to be likely, but also reported cases where the CoVID-19 tests on Coronovirus were equally positive after the removal of COVID-19.
In these cases, it was considered that there was a prolonged period of disease rather than a re-injurious injury.
The virus is considered to be natural, animal origin and infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its human transfer.
The first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 call for the earliest date of the first disease.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
A number of methods are commonly used to measure mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and the time of spread of disease, and also affect the levels of testing, the quality of health systems used in the treatment scheme, the beginning of the outbreak of disease and population parameters, such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO transmitted emergency assistance codes to the ICB-10: U07.1 — deaths from the laboratory confirmed infection SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 — deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.
According to statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and injuries was 6.9 per cent (153,822/2,240,191).
This figure varies depending on the region, and some other methods include determining the mortality rate as a result of the disease (CFR) which reflects the percentage of patients diagnosed as a result of the disease, as well as the definition of the mortality rate as a result of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (such as diagnosis and non-diagnosed cases) who end up in the disease.
These statistics do not relate to a specific period of time and reflect the indicators of a certain scale of population from the time of injury to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that the antibodies are not produced in all patients who have been infected, it is possible to understand how many people have been infected.
In the outbreak in Italy, Castillo d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4600, 80 (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the town of Hangelt, the disease was spread through youth canals, calling for a relatively lower death, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have an anthlete, a donor blood judge.
COVID-19 - The official cause of 69 deaths (0,004 per cent of the population).
The effects of pandemics and mortality levels are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is reduced by only 90 years of age.
In China the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this distinction are unknown, but can be found in genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender immunological differences, a decrease in the prevalence of smoking among men (e.g., hypertonia that affects men at a younger age than women) may lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe 57 per cent of the infected men were male, and 72 per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 were reported to men.
As of April 2020, the Government of the United States does not conduct gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and HIV, have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially medsisters, are more likely to be infected, respectively.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of this disease, COVID-19.
The WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adama Gobrisus, explains that "CO" means "corona", "VI" "virus", "D" "disease", and 19 when the first outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
Such a name was chosen to avoid the dispatch to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by international recommendations for the prevention of stigmatization. The virus, called COVID-19, is a severe severe coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19” in public communications.
And the disease, and the virus itself, usually calls it a coronavirus.
During the initial outbreaks in Ohana, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as “coron virus” and “Ohanic Coronavirus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “high respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of viruses and diseases.
Official names were published on 11 February 2020: "COVID-19" and "SARS-COV-2".
Because of the limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials such as the nose-tips, as well as the details of IVL equipment.
In one such case, the Italian clinic was urgently required in a ventilator, and the supplier was unable to deliver it at the required time, and one of the local productions was re-profiled and could print the required 100 cramps per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various theories of conspiracy, misinformation and false information on the origin of the virus, its size, prevention, treatment and other aspects have been widely disseminated on the Internet.
It is possible that humans may be infected with the virus of other animals.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of viruses among pigs, rabbits and rabbits.
There is currently no approved vaccine from the virus or medicinal product for his or her treatment.
The various international studies on vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial Programme (SOLIDARNOSTI), which aims to assess the healing effect of the four existing compounds that are considered most effective today.
The vaccine is ready to exist, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate preparations.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come into the human cell using ACE2 receptors, so the results of previous studies under SARS-CoV are used in scientific development.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First of all, researchers are trying to create a complete vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at prompt human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of a subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that enhances the sensitivity of the immune system to certain sub-virus units.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at the destruction of the S-like White, which helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 plant receptor.
A third strategy is the development of a vaccine based on nuclear oxygen (NNC or RNC vaccines, a new approach to the establishment of vaccines).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be checked for safety and effectiveness. The first clinical trial of the vaccine was initiated in Seattle on 16 March 2020 by four volunteers.
The vaccine contains an invaluable genetic code copied from the virus that causes disease. Anti-temperature was identified as one of the potential problems in the development of the vaccine from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption was controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials were conducted as of April 2020.
The preparation approved for malaria treatment was evaluated in seven trials, four of which were hydrochloric acid or chlorinated.
The reproducibility of anti-fraud equipment consists of most of the Chinese studies; nine studies were conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidacys for the treatment of COVID-19 was carried out. To this end, several other existing antiviral preparations for the treatment of COVID-19 are also considered, including remedicivir, chloroquine and hydrochlorothiazide, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of rhedesivier.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients who received reddecivir as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials are already taking place in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chlorine used for malaria treatment was considered in China in February 2020 and there are preliminary results.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquinine.
The Huhani Institute of Virus recommends a single gram of daily dose, but notes that it is very dangerous to double that dose and may lead to an early outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued authorisations for the extreme use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In China's 7th edition, interferons, ribavirin or morphine are also indicated as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inject SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for a detailed in vivo study, demonstrated induction of SARS-CoV-2 into low concentrations, and studies have shown that a white layer of trans-membrane 2 (TMPRSSS2) is needed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with ACE2 receptor.
The study of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without nitrogen has serious restrictions that do not allow the medical community to use these treatments without further examination. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinaemia may occur as a condition in later stages of severe form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquinin may have hypercytokine properties, and as a result of a recent study by the National Health Commission of China, the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus was included in tocilizumab.
This preparation went up to 2 stages of an unaccompanied test carried out at the national level in Italy after the positive results of its use in patients with a severe form of disease were obtained.
In combination with the analysis of blood clotting on ferritin to detect cytokines, it is intended to counteract factors that are considered to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017 the FDA was approved by an Internet-6 receptor antagonist on the basis of retrospective thematic studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokines caused by another cause, T-cell therapy CAR.
Today there are no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective cure for cytokine release syndrome.
The transmission of clean and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients with COVID-19 is currently considered a non-vaccinated method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but its results have been uncertain.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antithesis therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms, such as antithetelosuppressive cytotoxicity and/or fagocitosis.
Other forms of passive antithesis therapy, such as monoclonal antibodies, are at the stage of development.
The extent of the use of reconvalence of blood can be increased, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of the ovarian patients and contains an antidote to the virus.
Coronavirus disease, high-level syndrome group
Li Venlan, a doctor of the Hughan Hospital, who was injured and died from COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
