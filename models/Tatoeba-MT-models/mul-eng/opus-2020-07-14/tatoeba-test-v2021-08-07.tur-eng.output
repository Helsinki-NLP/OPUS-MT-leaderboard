Looks like we don't understand him.
You look like you're having a bad day.
Looks like you're right.
It doesn't make any sense.
He's important.
It could be bad.
It could have been Mrs. Satoh who sent these flowers.
It must be over by tomorrow.
It must be enough.
It must be broken.
He's never gonna get away with it.
There's plenty of rain here.
I talked to her about you.
I told him to use sun cream.
I told him what you were doing.
I told them what I saw.
I told Tom how Mary went home.
I told Tom I'd have to think about it.
Tell him I understand you're worried about Tom.
I told Tom I was just kidding.
I told him not to come to Tom.
I told Tom I didn't know the answer.
I told Tom that Mary was telling the truth.
I told Tom to call me.
I told Tom to listen.
I told Tom to see a doctor.
I told Tom to keep going.
I told you, but you didn't pay attention.
I told you to clean up your room.
I told you Tom wasn't busy.
It's just an hour.
I'm worried about him, too.
I made a 20-minute sugar.
I've been interested in her.
I've got a French class at the school.
I've seen French at the school.
He took it to the Queen of Kyoto.
I'm sure he's gonna win the fight.
I was looking forward to Tom's being there.
I was sure that Tom would be there.
I was sure he wouldn't do this.
I got my place at the end of the class.
I got my inspiration.
I got the book.
I got into a wrong car.
I understand exactly what he said.
This proved that he was a thief.
It became clear that Tom couldn't understand much more French.
The day he was born, the whole day was full of water.
I'm training you two hours a day.
It really depends on when it will be.
It's really a mess.
I tried again, but it's empty.
I've been trying a chicken with Karides.
I tried to get him involved, but he was the only one who wanted to stay.
I tried to forget.
I tried to convince Tom to use the car.
It's a bad deal.
It's a market.
It's a nice day out there.
It's time to stop watching TV.
Vov, vov, vov, hare.
That's a reason for the war.
Cassus is clear.
It's on me to see that it's back.
It's a hard word to translate.
It's a big advertising for the painting's tat.
Good plan, at least on the paper.
It's a great place to start.
It's a team effort.
It's almost an hour.
It's almost written.
It's been five years since English began to work.
That was already done.
It's great to win the money.
It's a high-powered device.
Visit your eyes to watch Tom playing basketball.
It's a shame to hear people talking in a library with a high voice.
It's an old joke, but it's good.
This is an old drug using secret fusion methods.
This is an ongoing process.
This opportunity comes to a person’s feet in 100 years.
This opportunity will pass through the hands of a person once.
This is a chance to come once in a lifetime.
It's a perfect place to start.
I'm sorry Tom didn't come here today.
It's sad that Tom's too young to die.
It's a pleasure to be able to help you.
It's a pleasure to be here.
It's a polytechnic engineer.
It's a popular spot.
It's Nisan today.
It's a matter of security for you.
That's a short way to school.
That's a little problem.
It's a step taken on the right side.
It's a treasure.
It's an amazing animal.
It's a mess.
It's impossible to talk when your mouth is full.
That's because he loves me.
That's why you don't want to be alone.
Good morning.
It's been a long time since I last saw you.
That was a good year.
It's been a hard year for me.
It's been a very difficult year.
It's enough not to do anything like that.
These are cold air.
It's hot.
It's been raining since morning.
It's been a few years since I was camping.
It's been two years since I last saw him.
He's been hot lately.
It's best to make calls from a person.
It's better to be alone than to be with a few fools.
It's better to have a drink than not to run into it.
This scares me a bit.
Of course he doesn't know what Tom should do.
Cassus is clear.
It's cold today.
It's dark here.
It's hard to analyze.
It's hard to get out of the car in cold mornings.
It is easy to fall prey to the desires and actions of others.
It's easy to imitate your feet.
He looked like a pigeon.
It seemed like a lot of trouble.
Looks like you're all wrong.
He looks like he knows the truth.
Looks like he's lying.
The rain looks like rain.
They seem tired of their married life.
It looks like you won me.
We're still here.
We're finally here.
He's warning me.
It's fun to watch you dance.
Game time.
It's getting harder to track down what's happened.
It's gonna be a shame.
It's gonna be sunset after breakfast.
It'll be worthless.
After that, it'll be hotter.
It's so nice to be here.
You're coming too good.
You're welcome.
I can't talk to Tom.
It's hard to find a good place to live.
It's hard to find a job in the U.S.
It's hard to think of a life without a pet.
It's hard to say no to them.
It's hard to sell houses that need to be trained today.
It's hard to tell you something.
It's hot outside.
It's hot outside.
Doing this won't take more than half an hour.
It's impossible to love him.
He's just an asshole.
It's like the air's hot, isn't it?
It's like being in a sugar store.
It's probably raining today, so it's better to take the snow.
It's like selling fresh air on the ground.
The station is more than three miles away.
There's a deadly heat today.
I'm in the middle of a conversation.
It's never right to do this.
It's good to be a role model for others.
It's nice to imagine.
It's good to see the dream.
It's just nice to talk to you like that.
It's nice to see you again years later.
It's tonight, but it's Sunday in Boston.
It's not a secret that's stuck under the front door.
He's not a good car, but he's a car.
It's not all bad.
It's not always so easy to do the right thing.
It's not that simple.
It's not bad.
It doesn't look good.
Not much, but it's never better.
It's not possible to live forever.
I don't think so.
I don't want to go, I can't see to go.
He's not comfortable.
It doesn't matter what you try to believe him.
All day long it's raining.
All night long, it's cold.
It's raining in Osaka.
Ten more hours.
Today's payday.
There's rain on the bardak's ventilator.
It's too late.
It's very empty.
It's so scary.
He's really cool.
It really doesn't.
It's said a new airport is going to be built in the city.
He said Tokyo was a very safe city.
Tokyo is said to be a very safe city.
It's said Tokyo's a very safe city.
What they're writing about in the newspapers is shocking.
It's raining in Boston now.
It's easy for Americans to say, "I love you," but in China it's impossible to do this.
The air is very cold.
It's still hot.
Write in Paris.
Write.
It started with a kiss.
That's the best for me.
He's the best French restaurant in New York.
It's time to pay.
Now's the time to count.
Now's the time to pay.
It's time for us to get out of here.
It's time we left here.
It's time to sleep, so close the radio.
It's time to go to bed, close the radio.
It's time to go to bed, close the radio.
Party time.
It's time to promise Tom.
It's time to start.
This is where the human eye is cut off.
This is Tom's only chance.
The air is hot.
It's too late to do this.
It's too late to get back.
It's too late to visit them.
He's so quiet.
It's a bad thing to be jealous.
We didn't realize Tom was here so early.
It's cold in this room.
The weather is cold today, isn't it?
It's easy to worry about you, isn't it?
He's very jealous.
That's romantic!
It's hot here all year.
The air's hotter.
It's written in Croatian.
I'll always love you.
You stopped going.
It's been the end of the week for us to paint the garage.
It took a long time to understand what he said.
It took five minutes to get to the station.
He took four months to get rid of his illness.
It took me hours to do this.
It took a long time to decide where we're going.
He took time to find out what had happened.
It took a while to increase your speed, but now you're gonna be in love with it.
He went out in the middle of a nice day.
It would always be.
It's always been.
It was a bad test.
It's a painful prison.
It was a cold night.
Ticari was a fission.
That wasn't a big argument.
That's a terrible test.
It's a good job.
It's been a long time.
It was an error.
It was an incredible feeling.
I'm sorry he didn't come to our party.
It's a very impressive name.
That was a strange feeling.
That was a terrible day.
He visited his eyes.
It was very nice to see you.
She's been cold here until Marta.
It was cold yesterday, wasn't it?
It's hard for you, isn't it?
All right.
It was easy to find his office.
Everything was like I expected.
It was exactly what I expected.
Everything was like I expected.
It was exactly what I expected.
The air was cold.
It was hard to say hello, wasn't it?
It was unregistered.
That's the problem.
He was lucky, and we got tickets for the concert.
That's what I wanted.
That's what I wanted.
The police called Mike.
He was adorable.
He was my last show.
It wasn't as easy as we expected.
It wasn't as easy as we expected.
It wasn't easy for him to keep his word.
He wasn't important to me.
It wasn't the first time they did it.
It wasn't Tom who did it.
He was one of the greatest discoveries I've ever known.
That was on the list.
He could've been taken care of.
It wasn't really a problem.
That's really funny.
It was a ghost who did this to him.
He was very mysterious.
He was still there.
It was a "bad uncle."
It was Tom's idea to sell our house.
It was Tom who told me that.
He was so tired.
The water was empty yesterday.
She deserved to try.
Mike took this rocket yesterday.
It'll be a long night.
It'll be over in one or two days.
It's gonna rain tomorrow.
It'll be 100 bucks for you to fly to the beach.
It's just gonna take a minute.
It's probably gonna rain.
There'll be rain in the field.
It won't be as hard as you think.
It won't be easy, but it's possible.
It won't be hard.
The air won't be open.
He won't come to her.
He's been working for a while.
Thank you, Tom!
It's sad if we're not allowed to do this.
It'd be nice to have a party.
It'll be hard to do it.
It would have been so easy to do this.
That wouldn't be appropriate.
I understand Tom's a nice program, but if I get a date from him, I'm really grateful.
I understand you both.
I understood everything.
I used to clean up my wife in my village.

I have to get you out of here.
I have to go meet him.

I was arrested this morning.
I'm completely in a new state of shock.
I liked it.
My eyes were empty.
He was flying pirates in my stomach.
I was sleeping in a cold hole.
I was easily taken in by his mild speech.
My soul was in pain.
I didn't understand until I believed in him.
I've been forced to bow down to my fate.
I was going to Boston next week, but I changed my mind.

I'm done.
I was talking about them.
I was taught English by a stranger.
I washed the dishes.
It wasn't my name.

It's been a while since I left.
I was in the laundry.
I was three years old then.
I used to watch TV.
He said I should give him a kilo.
He told me you saw your accident.

I was so rich to know him.
I was very sleepy and I was asleep right now.
I was so heavy then.
I was surprised when Tom told me that Mary was leaving Boston.

I've been watching Tom's drawing.
I looked at Tom's drawing.

I'll be back in 20 minutes for you.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I'll take you home.

I'm asking you and your family for a very happy Easter.
I wish you both would be silent.
I wish you hadn't.
I wish you wouldn't find me.
I wish you had told me the truth.
I wish you good luck next time.
I wish you were here.
I hope you don't do this anymore.
I've always stood up.
I always woke up before my hour.
I woke up again this morning with my headache.
I woke up in an office that stopped my little picture.
I was wondering why Tom was here.
I was wondering if Tom didn't tell Mary to do this.
I wonder how Tom managed to win.
I'm just wondering if it's not raining in France.
Is there any more of this?
I'm just wondering if Tom didn't sing as good as Mary.
I'm wondering if Tom's okay.
I'm wondering if Tom's busy.
I'm wondering if Tom's daughter is beautiful.
I'm worried we won't talk.
