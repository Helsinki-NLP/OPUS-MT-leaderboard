Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Parliament of Ukraine has today rejected the proposal to derogate from the amendment of the Criminal Code section in which it condemns the leader of the opposition Yulia Tymosenko.
The amendment would open doors to excarceration of the Minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia on natural gas purchase for Ukraine.
The judgment is not yet firm, the appeal court is obliged to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political advantage of the regime, and even in the West there were doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code with which the former Prime Minister was convicted was supported by 147 votes in favour.
226 votes were required for its adoption.
Libya's Victory
The history of freedom, or of the rebellion, has already been lost.
Muammar el-Gadafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
Who's the winner left to determine
As it is already customary in the region, Islamists have won the elections, but now it is about diluting whether it is moderate or radical
The Transitional National Council has introduced the traditional law, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the thieves will be cut off.
Women can already go forgetting to emancipate themselves and the apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, the society, made up of tribes of warriors, will be united by the Qur'an.
In Libya there will be an order that we can't even imagine and that we certainly can't.
However, our way of life is not the only one or objectively the best and probably did not convince the libidos already mentioned.
The truth is, it is not surprising that Islamic fighters accepted the help of faithless dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, NATO's attacks did not lead them to a general general in the United States, but great is the Lord, whose greatness followed each of the successful interventions.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shooting by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political alliance without guarantees of benefits.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not deal with Libya militaryly.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem putting them out of the "crazed"
But, without occupation, will the oils be made with the free black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that the West can ultimately claim to protect human rights.
As long as the followers of the Sharia don't cross us.
Starts a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe go to the hunt for investors
A statistical pipeline has been extended by Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquatrimester period has grown, while France and Germany have grown.
However, today's bonus market has been recorded.
The investors are no longer established not only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France by 0.4%
Both countries have made public data in the second quarter, Germany has improved more than expected (creature of 0.3 per cent instead of planned 0.1 per cent), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1 per cent (original data).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-territorial period, the gross domestic product (PIB) has been suspended and ČSU according to the trend towards gradual deceleration in the growth of economic development.
The results are even worse than the estimates of analysts.
Main events:
In the meantime, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but it has been shut down every quarter of the year.
In the third trimester, the German economy, according to the previously calculated data, grew by 0.5 per cent.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is consistent with the analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent annually.
The interest of its benefits for ten years is 28.45 per cent.
The interest of the Italian and Spanish bond has increased to critical limits.
The problem situation also affects Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interest of Czech bona fide for ten years remains at 4 per cent, although the situation is increasing in the area.
In Germany, votes are raised saying that the ECB should grant loans at the latest.
The checks are classified for the Eurocopa.
They win 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a first 200 million.
The football team completes with the most difficult comet of all time!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Czech and the bright port Peter Jiráček, the victory was given for 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, was fantasticly protected from the attacks on the local team, so that it will not miss the European champion's date.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in a negative report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good score in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the fall of the local team towards the end, as well as the excellent game of Čech and the hero Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its passage to the European Championship.
Because of the correct Czech defence, the mountainers did not press until the second half.
The two victims of the party were Damjanovic and Vuchinič, who were leaving two large occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the date of the European Cup, so the ships of the national football will get a grace of about 200 million crowns.
It's been a good offensive game since the first minutes.
Both teams worked only to keep the lines and played nothing more around the center of the camp.
There was no pressure on local players in the first half, going to the other field in defense, just what the defense is about to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They formed a human escort.
Several hundred university students formed human shelters around nuclear facilities in Iran.
They want to express their support for the country's nuclear programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students started praying on Tuesday morning to the facilities and then went to the U.S. and Israel death slogans.
A number of hundreds of university students formed the morning in the Iranian city of Isfahan human skeletons around the nuclear technology center in which they work with uranium.
They intend to demonstrate that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran, according to all indications, is engaged in the acquisition of nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students were asked to pray on Wednesday to the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death squads against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose aim would be to parallel the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the centre of Isfahan, but also the installations of Nathanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: do not breakfast and breakfast
More than a third of children aged between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with over 9 per cent of the school population and 5 per cent of obesity.
Obesity children come in the majority of families with a life-style that is not healthy, according to current research.
It is again shown how important the environment is where it grows for a healthy person's development, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
In the table, obese children are fed, for example, from embassies with at least twice the frequency than children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19 per cent of the obes had eaten frit potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention programme "Obey is not a coincidence".
In the families of children with overweight, there is no custom of practicing sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey conducted in 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and participated in almost 900 basic education from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supported the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
To date, more than 12 thousand children have participated in the project from 4th to 8th.
A proper diet and sufficient exercise in the family are determinants, which significantly reduce the number of children with obesity and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals under the regime: breakfast, lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with a taste for dinner
Experts warn that, in healthy development, it is important, in addition, the details, which also include, for example, having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In Chequia, however, only 23 per cent of school families leave at the same time.
In most families, each challenge itself.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10 percent of the homes there was nothing going on.
Breakfast, however, is the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children, breast - feeding is much more common than breast - feeding.
Almost everyone - regardless of the weight - drink to daily sweet refreshments (70%).
Generally, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed, however, this result is reduced to less than 15 per cent among their parents.
Brace your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the elected couples (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 colleges) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 from the point of view of healthy food are very far from ideal."
Among its favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It's particularly alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments," was the final report of the study.
As the main food, the palm takes the pasta and continues to search for the sheep's flesh.
In practice, children always refuse the legume and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive accurate information.
"In the study control group, which completed the questionnaire after the end of the "obesity is not a coincidence", an important change was made in many cases in favour of the principles of healthy food", focusing on the results of the study.
It calls for attention, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and current water.
Children would also be more often selected in the questionnaire the beef and the fish for the main food and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and the fruits of flour.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, supporting professionals.
In the introduction article, how the astrologers learn, I have already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would work.
Conferences of three branch professionals, how to wear challenging characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more information and practical work awaits us.
And even though the course develops every Saturday and Sunday, it's no longer an alfiler.
We've been studying with the director, Alena, (in the course no man) about how to dress the woman who doesn't have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone's curious, someone's got a stylized figure without the proper curves and someone's suffering too much.
The estylist must be able to optically smooth some horoscopes, extend a neck, or recrew the necessary curves
They have given us some tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type Jennifer López, of huge pieces and chains but tight belts and at the same time do not wear it in a very challenging way.
If, for example, the difference between the belt and the straps is so large that the buckle or pants do not fit, it is worth at least one extra piece of fabric to measure.
No doubt they will not repent, for the clothes they feel perfectly fit.
With a fall to measure it will feel much better than with someone who doesn't stop moving, get up, dance in the city, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with beds, decorations, cuts or cuts.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have every week to order all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid that with the assigned task, I already have more than that.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, who will have to design two weddings: one for the day and the other for the night.
The current aspect must be taken into account, the fashion style appropriate to the person in question.
I've been caught up with Miranda Kerr, maybe you know Victoria's Secret campaign.
I cry inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will have finally set up a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the youngest Selena Gómez.
We have to cut them off from the magazines or find them online and print them, so that they can be developed graphically.
The fashionboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of estylism.
The stylist, therefore, does not only look physically, but is also involved, for example, in the pages of the magazines (for specific topics, such as trends, pockets, abrasions, etc.).
All of this told us about the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all of this is already for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information on all types of bodies.
The estista Honza Pokorní, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and the estylist should know how to get him out of this.
And a good estylist knows how to work with the same suit of clothing in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardin (or, as they say in English, trunch-coat) can be dressed in the classic with cowers and shirts, but also serves to wear the naked body with tacoon shoes and photograph it as if it were really a dress.
Or it's enough to hold it and lift the neck to get a completely different picture.
"Judge with it," he insisted.
What is most valuable is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"So you can break it," said Jacob.
Finally, I see why we remember all these formulas, why, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not talking about the files.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve of what he wants to photograph.
So for a fashion history that has ten pages (so, ten outfits), you have to have ready, lists to use at least fifteen.
And in addition to the photos the clothes work in combination with other takings, all of them different from those used in reality.
All of this has to take into account the time to design the offset.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style suggest them alone, in many cases, half the success.
Just looking at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary song, but the image and the Marquetin have made it a global star.
In Chequia, for the moment, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of the stilists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (I have enough skills, my physical aspect is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, it must be taken into account that it is very likely that they will tell us a very different kind to their real (lower).
Then it is only to laugh and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebration has been arranged/delegated, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted on us not just to guide the estista in fashion, but to understand outfits.
During his work, especially he must communicate with the people he sees, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't do anything, he's defending his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify the dresser and complete it with good manners, you can't take and take everything he had and say, "Today what a horror."
"I find at least a couple of things you can weigh and recommend so that someone can put them," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything should end in the "placovka" call, that is, the job bag.
This is set around the belt and all the tools needed are there.
They are objects such as bricks, cut-offs, or impermissible. There is also a nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the product photo session such as balls or gorors), special pins of front grips, if this was bigger (alfilers and other types of puzzles are not allowed, so they could damage the fabric), or a costume game.
In order not to stay in the passive audience and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the soil of shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the study, on a flat surface, the soil could be damaged and much more outside.
And we didn't do more than cover and cover.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the arrows so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So I had to be very capable.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservations.
The truth is, I'm not given those skills very well.
This is just a small part of all we've heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedication to estylism at professional level is not a street of rose, but it gives me exactly the same thing that people say.
A Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Design
A trip, initially unspent, is complicated due to a number of unnecessary delays of a routine trip during the morning tour.
A certain measure was made to cover the expectations, but it does not serve anything, if it was actually not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, the title added to The Run, revealed great expectations already before its exit.
He promised that he would give new air to the old race fair Need for Speed and, as a result of the show, appeared like a game that shouldn't end being a kind of action again.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would remain inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walk through his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results would not be much more than we expected.
There are careers that can be given by acceptable means, but in the total computer, points are lost due to absurd errors, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In fact, no mistakes can be named, but it is better than the incomprehensible disparity of the programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
If you introduce them into a story whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to resolve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You are seated on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty tracks.
It turns out that each race has a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting.
Thus, one does not have the sense that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to view, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous delivery of the series.
So it's nothing in the other world.
But the passage through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, careers vary from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you will find a sandstorm that reduces visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you have to be careful not to hide an avalanche.
According to that, each of the courses is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, try to slow down a number of rivals required (normally in a classic career), then try to win time (croned classic debt) and then wait for a debt against a single opponent.
In the middle of all this, the police sometimes appear, which does not make things more difficult.
The news is the landscapes out of the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to get away from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are many less landscapes in the game of what should be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element is not going to be disturbed and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the waves of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big thing, but it can't be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a real simulation, you can already search elsewhere.
But in a race designed with a lot of action you deserve enough of this style of conduct, although we can find something better among the games of competition.
So far, it's all right.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, it is no longer the same with the collisions.
Of games like this you can't expect to recruit complicated deformations and collisions, but actually before a hit on any object, you can't predict how you will react to your car, which is not everything in order.
It's typical that, when you make a very adjustable advance or circle the car with a normal traffic, there's only light rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car is just making uncontrollable pirates.
Even it's completely destroyed.
Thanks to the restorative system, there are no major problems, but it can put us in bad mood.
The resistors are programmed so that, when you experience an accident or get out of the track, the game restores you to the last point of escape in the track.
In each race, however, only five are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's no more than helping if something's not going well, but it's not too hard to trust.
Sometimes, even the restorative helps, only helps learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, it is necessary to enter in a specific way; otherwise, it is impossible to take.
Sometimes you'll find 'civils' cars on some site always with the same configuration, even though you're the first, five or five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry, especially in situations, when you see two cars going to meet in hostile directions, your opponent goes ahead with no problems, but when you arrive, you have to turn or go well.
It's like when you get there, because it's programmed because "sperm" will always happen in front of your noses.
Opposers also have another advantage.
During the entire game you will get to places where, without taking into account the moment, you will always get the same opponent on the same site.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, at a long point, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at the price you are.
When you go in front of you, it's hard for you to see the cars coming forward, so at first you can make the car paper.
The idea of creating a game with maximum suspension and adrenaline doses can be understood, but the execution is so apparent that you will surely be disappointed.
And it's a shame, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often impossible to follow the details of what happens anywhere.
And really does the same, if the merit is taken by the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that it doesn't stop burning, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the race.
You have to be careful about the fuel outlet on the side of the road, because just there you have to change from car, even in most cases you'll have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports is suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight and exotic superports for technical driving, for example by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative figure also appears a figure of parallel challenges, i.e., there are careers in specific places that you will know about history.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serve both for the challenges and the accounts.
When reaching the top level, the driver opens several possibilities, starting by car and finishing with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an Autolog function is connected online, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other Community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last career in history is done.
With the car you reach up to the tunnel of the metro (pass), where you put them to run dark through the roads (pass).
The speed meter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you comes the train of the metro and carries them forward without further delay.
In the editorial we will certainly have a discussion on this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought a little or if the real authors take us for a bunch of bugs.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes up to the top.
For example, at times it seems that, in the more tense times, the quality of the image is reduced and, at times, seriously.
This affects especially the accidents in which many participants have been involved, when the quality of the image continues to be invalid.
The audio is good and the sound band is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the sound band belongs to the category "each of its father and mother", but it may be assumed that no one would buy the game only for their music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confused.
If the game avoids absolutely gross mistakes, we would have problems claiming that The Run is the best game of NFS in recent years.
It makes sense that the game is not over.
The fun is assured, but prepared because the mistakes will strike you in the eyes with the strength of some airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negatives and Eurosceptics.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a quartet."
"It will take five, six years before the situation becomes a bit stable, calm, and the new players are accustomed to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began his conference with conviction in the Faculty of Law.
How can you not take it seriously as "clear and open about Europe", which he said at the first part of his conference, when he was able to describe each EU body and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, as it would be the envy of many conferenceers of the U.S. Law Faculty.
Vice-President Herman van Rompuy also stressed the work of the new permanent President of the European Council:
"First of all the criticisms arise, that if it is insulin, a gray officer can assume any role, but I have to say that he left all disagreeable, because he takes his roles to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to the members of the twenty-ninth states, communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of the representative of the Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union in the face of States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban the smell of Olomouc
Vicenová has also taken up the next agenda, followed by and will be followed by the European Council in the near future.
The Czech Presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Chequia.
Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good alboroto", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, the EU budget for seven years should be approved, which is caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which will be less? That is something that will be present in the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled its main themes, which came to Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The truth is, I don't like the cuts made, the strangers or the old ones that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the peps are not actually invented the curved or round, platinum of different sizes or that no one will ban the smell of Olomouc?"
It also aims to bring more benefits to the EU environment and to attract more Czech citizens to the European institutions.
We are waiting for Europe of Speeds
According to the ambassador, the Czechs are famous for Eurosceptics and people are better aware of the negative aspects than the positive ones.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The guilt is of many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visagrad Group.
"I believe that when a Polish and a Hungarian are coming to me and I am approached by a Slovak, a Frenchman on my side says to me, "What have you left, the Visedrad Group?" and it is seen that he does not give any thanks."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, looks forward to new strict budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as a very real thing in the concept of both speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It has been said for the first time that only the countries that want and who don't, are cooperating."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe of both speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of Chequia and Herman van Rompuy in implementing the principle, which states that all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed between the Member States, not only between the members of the Eurozone.
Fire story:
The innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone is looking for a term that defines IBM's strategy very precisely, the closest would be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is recognized as current and, however, has been through for hundreds of years since its foundation.
The foundation of this long-placent character was laid by the first head of the firm, viewer Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already pointed out that many of the world's problems have a solution if people are willing to think.
His title "Think!" became his seal, around which he will build the life of the giant future (also the title of an internal magazine that IBM started publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised company culture.
"For us, IBM involves a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a thousand years for that reason, because he remained faithful to his basic principles, but without fear of the changes around him.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to make further progress in our second century," said during his anniversary, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmsano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in his 30s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the company of Băa in Chequia (BBM employees were among the first U.S. operators who enjoyed paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that awarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication holds IBM in relation to the customer.
Since the beginning, the company has been about to discover talent (as one of the first world companies to end with any kind of discrimination, it could choose no problem).
On the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current IBM plan, so Palmsano will replace it with the year a woman comes: Virginia Romeo.
She has been working in IBM for thirty years, where she has been chief sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years IBM has been involved in the calls for virtual encounters, a flood of online ideas, resulting in the infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It's not surprising that they're talking about ideas, because almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of an institution more than of a technological enterprise," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that seeks to solve business problems for technology users," points out George Colony of the Forrester Research consultant.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or "Green Green" - as it is known in the United States family due to its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies in the past hundred years.
It is possible that the technology company is more versatile ( it develops both programs, infrastructures and web accommodation services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
At least the largest number of patents from all North American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are automatic cashiers, payment cards, financial permutations, bar codes and discounts.
This year IBM will bill $22 billion. This year has become the second technology signature by market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied customers' taste and time (IBM did not start by its own operating system, OS/2, online services Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers).
"If his business is based on progress, he cannot be emotionally shaken in the past," recognized Samuel J. Palmsano.
Therefore, IBM has no problems building its foundations on other platforms (and also, if they do not work, leave them).
And that's the difference of competency, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which about one fifth are programme and another fifth of equipment.
However, in 1990 the teams represented more than half the number of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets at a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in future technology purchase.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis was first demonstrated.
IBM acts according to its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investments during the great economic crisis of 29.
It seems that until now IBM has been able to understand the crisis.
The value of IBM's actions from the beginning of 2008 has increased dramatically to 120 per cent, and the net profit of the company has not increased.
IBM's currency is to change everything, except its value.
It can be expected, therefore, that when the next crisis is over, this flexible giant will arrive.
IBM history: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a thousand years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM is already adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in the South American and South Canadian sources.
The basis for the birth of IBM comes from the merger of four companies which are re-mounted in the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "ficharereres", which allows him to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over his board of directors until 1930.
Flint was the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas continue to be the firm basis for supporting corporate culture and identity).
Watson directed the company until 1952.
IBM, as indicated by its name, started production and sale of all types of equipment for business, from meat cutters and cheese to registered boxes.
During the first four years that Watson directed the company, the invoice doubled to $9 million and began to expand the company by continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years later, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (in Mercurio, Saturn and in 1969 the famous Luna flight).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pes", which established the standard of computers at that time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, by its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer full advice and services with added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid these three years is the concept Smarter Planet, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances have improved, for example, in relation to the transport and administration of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM presented the "Smart Trade" platform that allows minorities to manage the full commercial cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932 he opened a branch office in Czechoslovakia then, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic externalisation centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. There is also a global fame research team that works with the recognition of voice.
Laughter about de su marido infiel:
Iveta, hold on to that hole, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richter (53) says it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtár (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartoskova (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Joseph would wake up from his red dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not like my couple anymore," explained Rychtárová.
When Darina Rychtárová welcomed Bartošove in her home during the summer, she could not imagine how she would end her marriage.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved for thirty days after Ríčany and Pepe did not leave the singer.
So he publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina re-signed, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship, and even disappeared from him forever.
Rhychychtár doesn't care who complains about his wife.
If one day Rychtár broke up with Bartoshová, his wife wouldn't wait for him at home with the open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will forget him."
"But here I would live, not as my dear old and old, who was wrong, but as a man who united me with certain legs," said Rychtárová and added that she had already been separated from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
It doesn't matter to Joseph that his wife has closed the door behind him.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife set this up as a marriage over the role and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the house, I buy."
"Darina and I talk to us normally, the only thing we don't share in bed is that we don't share a bed," Rychtár said.
If Richard found a new love, he wouldn't object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care where she goes or if she has any news.
I know it's my fault, I love Iveta and take all responsibility," concludes Joseph.
The worst victims of women: Are they also referring to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vibes of women, in general each of them will appoint them without any thought.
Dear women, do you recognize in the following lines, where are certain women's vibes who can produce blood to the veins?
Go to shopping
Do you reject your average orange that depends on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one shop a week?
Do you like to buy it often in the bathrooms?
Then in your case it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women are aware that they should be appalled by purchases, at least a little.
But what could a woman resist the attempt to pass without further passing through the clothing shops, looking for well-adjusted picks and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women to go shopping is a period of time, for men it can be practically converted into a hell.
Just remember how many times she told her husband that it was better to wait in front of the door.
Consistency is not satisfactorily satisfied
"Am I not too fat?"
"It would take at least five kilograms - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like it?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What is it?
Then she's one of those women who's obsessed with her aspect.
Not that you should stop caring, but many men are anxious to listen to your mate complain all the time about your physical appearance.
Strong sex is also agreed that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more disturbing women return.
The order and cleaning first
It's like an infinite uncle.
Clear windows, pass the aspirator, freeze the floor, remove dust, freeze the bathroom, and all of that at least twice a week.
Does he complain to his mate that he has sanded the clean soil with a dry foot, to his children who have washed up a recently cleaned bath and a glass ester that so much cost him cleaning?
If you suffer this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not be taken into account as primary in the family.
This indefensive desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make unsubscribed comments
"The pants used are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put yourself in the kitchen tomorrow."
"The moving trap doesn't leave itself on the ground!"
If you make those comets to your mate more than once a day, you know you'll get him out of your house.
You don't mean anything bad, you just want to make it all right.
Perhaps, if men were to suspect this, women would not make so much comments.
Dictionaries and Crescens
Some women are also subjected to slander, slander, but also abuse and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how and why.
To the best of each of us is sometimes a small and indefensive chisme.
With the hand in the heart, this is almost all the women.
On the other hand, there are beautiful women of those who do not control, whom they like to smile and do so often, they despise everyone and they become dangerous for those around them, especially in a female working group.
Jágr and Varáček helped with their help to win the Philadelphia
Jágr's hockey Jaromír Jágr participated on the moon in the NHL with two assistance that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in Caroline's corner and again put Czech players in the front of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giraux took advantage of the 39-year-old star game, and made a step further and was better declared player of the game.
Two assistance was provided in the party as well as Jágr's partner, Jakub Varáček.
After the meeting, Jagr said to the journalists that Giroux had preached a great night.
"I had told you before the game that I'd do triple."
"The present."
"Sometimes they seem confused," explained Jágr, after his behavior gave him a bullet in Giroux, due to the first trace of Flyers.
A few minutes later, the second team intervention also had a Czech trace.
Voráček made it with the disc behind the Ukrainian port and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, which put it down.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the beginning of the second part they have dominated the Flyers.
Especially by Giroux.
After working with Jágr put the third floor, after his shooting was stopped at Wayne Simmonds' door room.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to be the best singer of the song, but there's no doubt between the three best," Jágr pointed to his center.
"Never would have happened to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very satisfied with that."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my friends played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, from prison to a distant goal.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up in two against one.
"I've had a good act in our field."
"I lost the disc, I took speed, and Read went to the farthest part."
"I'm trying to touch you on the disc and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the last ball of the party as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has become the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third he was removed from the upper part of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also by a difference of two balls, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec is not supposed to use one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local trainer were the great number of injuries in the last row, and to play the game only with five defences.
"That's bad."
"We only played the game with a veterian player, the rest were new."
"At last, but it's that against that there's nothing to do, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"As long as the players drove back against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game further, get the disc out of our field."
"And so let's leave eggs," explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban.
Ondréj Pavelec contributed with thirty Winnipeg interventions in the victory of 5:2 on Tampa Bay.
Jet's balls were marked by five players who ended up in a series of matches that were already five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at the time sold in most cases travel only to the socialist block, since travel in the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists were therefore on vacations at the RDA (Germany Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) in Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslavia regime moved west and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great barrier to socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist block (i.e., also the Czechoslovakians) were not allowed to travel freely and individually, not even by the Socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West in those days, but one had to put on the cola with a bed bag and spend the whole night, or having "good-known" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "change promise" that was the condition for Western travel was not granted to the "politically low-liquid agent", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
Most of the Czechs had their vacations in their own country, so there were a large number of horses and summer houses that the Czechs would buy. This custom still persisted.
The way the Czechs travel has suffered a genuine revolution since 1989.
While it was not until 1989 for us that the holidays were no longer in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, from which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, was unable to travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia from then on.
At the beginning of the 1990s, visa exemption was imposed to travel to neighboring countries of Western Europe, resulting in a huge amount of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechs, for a long time, did not see maps of the trips to the West, the whole world wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, checkups were slept in parks in camp stores, as our income did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to bring with them food (conservations, embutites, etc.) to store.
Another important moment was the introduction of the conversion of the Czech crown, so our tourists were finally able, after decades, to buy free Western currency.
Our standard of living also increased the average wage, which has resulted in an increase in the demand for travel by around 1997.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies from 1997 onwards regularly began to prepare travel using charter flights, which made the prices of travel in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by passenger volume.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs had traveled almost all developed countries, except the United States, which made our journeys even more simple.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-conflict tourism occurred already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Chequia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have made distant and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from Chequia to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-conflict development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, with what our country had gone through to be among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent abroad on trips to over 15,000 Czech crowns per head, including expenses at the station.
Called the General Ordinaria Assembly to elect the President, which could end again at death.
For almost five months, the Czech football is no president and Ivan Haszek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburg.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the rules of procedure to be followed.
Without the same, no vote will be taken even to choose between the three candidates.
Interested in chairing the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hashek gave up his job in June not before calling his colleagues with the intention of finding a strong person who is unable to handle the football in the future.
However, after the completion of the Hashek era, a dispute arose between the two association federations unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new President had to be elected.
Delegations of the General Assembly met in a van in the National House (Národní dhom), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only on the election method.
No consensus was reached or anyone in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment on and due to this only point, a partial agreement was concluded, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which states that full representation is not possible.
However, the debate on the electoral code remains open.
More light on the situation could no longer be denied to the Executive Committee that, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, essentially nothing had been resolved.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a few times already, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: How do we proceed in the third round to avoid the point of death?
"The debate revolves around whether to act in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents the professional football.
According to the proposed model in the statutes, the third round will win that candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his application.
The Moravia Region is willing to reach a compromise in order to win that candidate with a greater total vote in both federations.
The bohemia, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentages, should have at least two thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of the bicameral system," as Svoboda understands the objections of the party living, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote in accordance with the applicable statutes.
It is surprising that Tomaš Paclik agrees with this too, although the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all candidates is supposed to be more appropriate to Pelta.
"I would like to vote to the maximum according to the statutes."
"In order not to have any information about representatives such as in the last General Assembly," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who was asked for the first time as a candidate and directed his comments mainly against Pelta.
The ball is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburg will decide on the new president and he believes that future candidates will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be accompanied by today's party of our national team at the European Championship.
"The football will become a protagonist again, and thus will be more cooperative," said the representative of Jablonice, who has more experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is the most recent.
"I hope an agreement is reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between bohemies and residents, but there's an attempt to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"In any way, I hope the common sense will be imposed," said Rajchl.
It won't be long enough for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team is complete?
The special aircraft in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport to the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decision-making meeting could ultimately be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, according to them, will be held on this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to include the parties divided into the most powerful sports organization in the country in order to reach an agreement.
There is a lot in play: state subsidies, football credibility and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czech Federation for Sport (ČSTV) that will try to get a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka Lotteries House.
Paclik will fight for the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the chief of Pilsen footballists, Tomaš Paclik, prior to the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate to satisfy all his ideas on the new President of the Czech Federation (FAČR), he would not be presented as a candidate at such a relevant position.
"If I had an appropriate person, I would be fighting for her and not present me as a candidate to the elections."
"But until today no such person has been found," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclik also points out that, in the event of a win, he would only remain in the presidential position until 2013, when he arrived at the turn of the ordinary General Assembly.
In that regard, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people who could take into account."
"For me it was a shame to hear some say that at this moment they don't even want to identify themselves with the Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he added.
What is most likely more disturbing to Paclik at this time is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential seal.
"If he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in the football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, a man of ambitious business, the football will bring even less profit," Paclik said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a case of corruption, from which Pelta was charged.
"I don't know what reward the football could bring the victory of Pelta."
"And with what eyes will the UEFA and the FIFA look at us," Paclik said, who also takes a certain precaution for his previous statement that "the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta became president."
In the case of winning the election of the Thursdays, Paclík could develop cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion it is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September which ended in a coup.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"It's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as head of the representation."
"but not as manager of an association."
"I don't even put the narciss there where I can't feel it," Paclík added, who in September drew much attention to supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission, chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It uses its capacity to manage private companies, as since last summer it has also been the Director of Pilsen, who held the triumph in the first division in May with his support.
"I have the power to change some things in the football field and contribute to your safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of certain pressure groups, which are likely to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without concealing his antipathies to the president of the Sparta Daniel Krétínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FARC and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders so that they could spend more money on the sport of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key issues the new president should be devoted to."
"If tax increases on gambling, as political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where this money is going to end," she said.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "non-party".
Pelta is currently associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense of sending my actions from the Pilsen Club to another person later after a year and a half," Paclik said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end with the death of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Fütbol Association, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, the FAČR would ensure that new statutes would definitely be used to resolve the dispute over the electoral regulation in the future.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting of this youth in Nymbruk, and believes that the pre-selective conflict could lead to a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in the event of being elected, precisely in the representation and in the recovery of funds.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this delay of two months could go well for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels are busy with football for a long time and are waiting to meet this Thursday to the new President."
"I feel it's time for someone to manage the association," the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked on the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, he thinks he has enough experience to manage the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Hashek.
"Please, in the General Assembly in June, the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought were adopted."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
The amendment of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a signal to the delegates.
"If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to answer if this happens."
"It's a question of principles, without which we can't exist," says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, he tries not to match his opponents.
In the past, he had already warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, who respected his training in law, aware that his opponent would also be his first Vice-President.
I had spent a lot of time without attacking Thomas Paclik who, unlike Pelta, did not let his head down.
"He's been in the football world for more than a year, and he's already achieved some success."
"Your attacks, but they were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," said his opponent Pelta, who is still faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon, he says, is his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest.
This is supposed to be a football promotion escape.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the scandal of corruption last year."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told the ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as football president would not involve any personal changes to the template.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, a understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are watched before the next General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel this Thursday to Nymbruk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"The football needs credibility, which will only be recovered if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in its career as a representative, Pelta continues to be optimistic.
Rajchl promised, under his leadership, the FAČR would start working with profits.
If, in the fourth General Assembly, the current Vice-President, Jindrich Rajchl, as the new President of the Czech Football Association, were elected, many people would certainly be sensitive.
Rajchl promises that if he was elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to earn more money for football and to continue with the work initiated by former President Ivan Hashek.
"As president, I would like to fully dedicate myself to football."
"From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, through the professional football or the training of high-performance football players."
"With this I don't mean I would do it all by myself," said Rajchl in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member can dedicate himself to a specific area."
"And I'll assign difficult tasks so that the football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticise the work of others," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not being presented again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me that will prevent me and hinder me every step," he explained the reasons for his decision.
"Many people have told me I don't have to give up because then they would also give up the others."
"It's about having faith to not leave that way, no more," he said.
According to them, he was also motivated to continue the work that had already started with Hashek.
"For those two years, a lot of work has been done that I don't want to lose now."
"There are processes that have started and that will have their effect within a few years and I would not like to have a father," he announced concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before the time of Hashek.
"I believe in order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to keep.
"After him is above all all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for some of the chosen."
"I can be reproducated a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's just how everyone feels and not just the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
He also rejected the idea that only the president would be disappointed.
"Even though some people try to say the opposite, I intend to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about the fact of dividing the second division into a Czech and a resident, whose winners would go to the first division."
"It would not be the current situation in which we have only three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young live players," said Rajchl.
Although the war of the presidential elections took place in Tomaš Paclik, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl did not stop believing in its possibilities of being elected.
"I am still sorry to have strong support for the Czech Federation, which elected me as its Vice-President and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," Rajchl said, whose success includes the saving of tens of millions of crowns of dissuasive contracts, TV contracts negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, recognize your part of the guilt in which the federation is not united.
And while claiming that Pelta is "unqualified to recover confidence in the Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclik, as a strong candidate who has something to offer the football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he has been elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Haszek had begun and would not significantly change the staff pattern in the committees."
"I don't want to use it for my own sake," assessed his rival Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Blue-Bracelet
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an amazing, quiet baths in Budapest: Who's visiting Europe can live its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest on its sandy legs in bourgeois baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be lost in his team, a bathroom.
Tumbada of spasms on the water, looked at the art of digging on the top, went up to the angels of marble, who waited on it at the pool's edge, and was surprised at the modernist covered pool that was restored methically.
He liked the bathroom, took note of his book at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectonic historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the swimming pools covered in Munich, the historical bathrooms in Selva Negra, the "hormigon constructions" in Taunus.
It carried out its "Travel by the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city, respectively, in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for bathroom culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers him that those who are attached to the bathroom have to conform to blue and chlorine oils, while those who are attached to run can breathe the fascinating smell of beet forests or listen to the triangular joys of the birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the pools should always be so late," said the resident of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful swimming pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The table in the pool and the oil stars of the sauna. The factor of well-being in the pools is so great that all senses are touched, according to Meder.
And if the builder is trying, covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "In a place of soil, in the bathrooms there is a surface of water."
"For one part is transparent, for the other, reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: the high bubbles, the blues, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and the history of art in the historical oasis of the well-being, but, mainly, they want to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the best examples in his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medical baths such as the pool of Széchenyi from Budapest, 100 years old, water is found with nitrates in a single cavities cavities (cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some terms, whose swimming pools are of alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-like building (Várasis Termáflürdö in Jaszberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While all the city places its eyes on the pool covered by Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which the practice can be observed on ski tracks.
The design, perhaps, is more extraordinary for customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral seems to be an ovni that just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources up into the winter, while the mountains of Ötztal are mainly raised in the sky.
Alhambra in Selva Black
At Meder, the pool collector, he didn't invasate the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths cry for oil, in Arpád's baths in Bekessaba, Hungary, the gas tank is so strong that people think it has reached a health bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkaline and whose leg is attached to the skin when entering the pool, a special enjoyment of well-being.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit uncovered swimming pools and sun baths in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he found a locked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of the Duan Jurkovic architect was closed.
When Meder looked through the demorned windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the pain growing between the steels.
The decadence was contrasted with a beautiful pool in the Selva Black: the Termal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three stages of construction behind them; they can not only be found neuromanical elements of their construction times in 1844, but also an Arabic style hall Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its extensive modernization in 1995, the Termal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural from the Black Selva.
"It is very important to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In such a palace, the entrance to the thermal pool seems to be of little importance.
Agrarian Speculation
The Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to test the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the Consortium Chief wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, it is clear, according to one study, that 84 percent of Germans do not seem acceptable that banks are speculating agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents claim that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions will withdraw from this business because it will intensify the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of an investigation by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global raw materials deposits bring prices up, and banks are responsible for the global hunger problem.
The consumer defence campaign is directed specifically to Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw materials deposits were considered to protect merchants from price oscillatings.
The main experts agree that players have been decoupled by offers and demands, and have gained from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann responded to criticisms differently from U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "should compromise the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the requirements of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
By the end of January, the bank’s management will inform the consequences.
Finally, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total absence.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, Founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reiterated his criticisms to the financial sector: "The growing food prices show particularly tragic how the banks currently damage public well-being."
Ackermann is the largest banker, especially in bonds.
"Deutsche Bank must cancel all its investment in which it plays the money for food prices deposits," Bode said.
"As if Ackermann is dealing with the subject of people who experience hunger or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection turns out to be surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the Consortium Chief wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the President of the Board of Directors would change something different from what was not planned in the Board of Directors.
With the absence of the controversial agrarian speculation, you can perfect your image.
And he needs only to care for possible losses, so his successor will take care of it.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 internalists have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute of the Force had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank would offer investments in which food prices would be fixed.
Many bank clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments in agricultural speculation money.
43 per cent would recommend such a bank to its acquaintances, 49 per cent would request, after reflection, cancel its account and change to another institution.
House 21 in Vienna
The moved palette
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with high heights and a happy ending, the palace of the Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 received prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and disappeared.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
The modern postager architecture is a beautiful, clear form, crystal halls, valid curves and new construction materials, typical of the thinking about technical progress, so the Austrian palace of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Babylon then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture by its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to date to date a contemporary site of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria's palace in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building planned in Munich, it became internationally known.
His palace, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was raised after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten in the south of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and a museum of the 20th century was inaugurated called "house 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; no wall to hold art, no good environment.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and falls ever more.
At present, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the palace, now called "house 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
The morning in the morning, the beautiful museum, which belongs to the house, with the first exhibition, was set up in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian beauty gallery since 2007, has achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in the history of art with a considerable career, among other things, an artistic painter on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, Guggenheim Museum and the founder director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, made reforms with the insistent political and protection of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the humanitarian foundation should have a café and a library and also build an office building.
strict control, budget below
Krischanitz was the best choice to make.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's section in Vienna had been substantially reformed, he was expanded and the competition was assisted, but not because he studied with Swanwer at Vienna Technical University and the palace was a "important and large place" in which he considered the exhibitions "mostly every weekend".
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in exchange for the use of generosity and ease.
In today's reforms there are big problems, the building was "a waste of energy," Krischanitz said.
The window profile of the glass façade was changed, an insular crystal reinforced with glass fibre was installed and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety crystal.
The thermal bridges and steel pipes were strengthened or replaced, and the roofs of the environment were rehabilitated.
Two rooms were used for the new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter almost new building, but still the Schwanzer palace.
The original outer doors remain, the house is painted in old brown tones and protected against oxidation.
And the cinema room is exactly like it used to be.
And all of this with strict control by the monumental office and a low budget.
"I often had to find materials that were good, cheap, and also to enjoy the monumental protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of an open ground in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lighter.
The role of the "Brussels wine" has been difficult, said Kristianitz, a typical "consual appearance in the history of the city".
Such a architecture is "always in the wrong place" and therefore I wanted to "expect the right conscience".
In this case, the house 21 is not in the wrong place, has been hit by urban success. The completely new and planned "barrier of the central station", with housing and offices, is located next to Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another disaster of luck occurred: The house 21 could be strengthened by another construction of Krischanitz, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin weather art room and, as it is said, negotiates with the city about a nearby location in the Swiss Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a package of winter crisis that rises to millions
The company has developed a crisis plan, which would avoid the destruction of trains in winter.
The number of personnel must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against averaging and delays in winter trains, Deutsche Bahn spent more than EUR 70 million this year, according to a periodic report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported, calling for an internal crisis plan of the group, of the investments envisaged by 2005 of a total of around EUR 300 million.
A better availability of vehicles and the railway network must be achieved with an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double domestic and foreign employees to 16,000 jobs to remove the snow from roads and islands.
The objective is to clean snow and ice pellets for the operation and 90 per cent of the water required for the operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, President of Deutsche Bahn, also warned of accidents and delays in trains during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
The past winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable travel problems, since, among other things, he lacked reservations against weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be authorized by the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check high-speed trains with frequency in the workshop, after a high-speed train will suffer the rotation of an ice at the central station of Colonia.
Deutsche Bank pays many millions in the United States.
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new problem arises from the U.S., the Deutsche Bank has to pay a millionaire there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, its past in the United States acquired the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute paid $145 million (106 million) in an agreement to end the content due to the core of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage securities.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator condemns many large banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; the risks have been reduced.
These titles lost their value during the financial crisis and attracted banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the subject without the parties having to appeal to the courts," said a spokesman from Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not accept any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debrie Matz, President of the NCUA, observed the difference between the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of fraud to protect customers' investments.
The NCUA seeks to reintegrate the losses of millions of people.
The currently closed agreements are their first type.
The regulator had also requested other large banks and in summer filed complaints against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the double hypothetical titles, the so-called values supported by hypotheticals are considered.
These are based on resident credit.
When the U.S. real estate bubble set up in 2007, it lost many financial entities.
In September 2008, in the light of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results have occurred a few years ago, I am currently sending a complicated wind for the US banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated inexhaustible procedures to receive compensation or to punish errors.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of applications.
It calls on the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. hypothetical agencies Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac have benefited from the mortgages business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a request from the FHFA for business of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires that the Frankfurt Institute respond to "substantial losses", without specifying an exact number.
Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that he wanted to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
Buffett's financial gain is strongly invested in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March, actions have been acquired by a value of more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies since long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read the IBM commercial report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand much before IBM offered all services and sought computer systems for other companies' Information Technology departments.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the priority of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now appeared at the CNBC economic station that has acquired IBM shares at a value of $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway has invested with it one of the biggest IBM shareholders with a 5.5 percent share.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the commitment until now.
He commended the direction on the normal benefits in the economic crisis.
"They did a great job," said Buffett about the strategy.
IBM has long established the services of Lucrative Information Technologies such as the operation of calculation centres.
The older computer pioneer over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided technology companies until the date.
He said he would only invest in businesses whose businesses he would understand.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the opportunity in a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own branches, as well as part of a whole series of great concerts such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, ancient Munich Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, extended it to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life - style is humble.
That's why he's an idol for countless investors all over the world.
His quick and infamous sense of winning money gave him the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
After finding Buffett's investment, IBM's operations in stock amounted to one per cent.
"The blue giant", as is known to IBM, has a value in bag of more than $220 billion and figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, said Buffett, he doesn't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A journal speaks of a "bloody ideology" that returns to life.
The killings of eight small Turkish and Greek entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a right-of-the-right background.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have responded with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was believed dead a long time ago, since fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with an extreme right background against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobic in Germany.
The discovered ultra-directory network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were neither, nor much less predictable.
"Do you want to reinvigorate the bleeding ideology?", titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper stresses that one of the perpetrators of the crime was a informant of the Federal Constitutional Defence Office and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist regime.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted consciencefully, and the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a watch in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, reflected in a solemn act of the fifty-year-old Turkish-German agreement.
Convivence has been staged with happy colors, as a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a buffet: "The German gift for the fifty-year-old", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German "Hürriyet" issue also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
"Starting to smell bad," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that the killers were persons who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In Turkish online forums, police conduct and its subsequent success in the search are critically discussed.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not sought much before suspects in the circle of the ultrasound.
Someone is less retroitorious about the media: "From now on, immigrants are lost, and they are left with nothing but self-defence and arms."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany strongly depends on the quality of the clarification and adaptation of sanctions to the whole network," writes "Selen".
This means that, if the internal peace of Germany is at risk, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be made clear in nine years.
The image of the ruins of Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish monuments.
No other event made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can result in violence.
The attacks convey the feelings of the Turkish party.
Can not open message
In the Turkish press, then, mainly the lack of German policy following the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire-fire attack by Solingen sent a telegram of offense to Turkish President Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced it in the Colonia funeral. Kinkel explained in his speech what the Turkish people of Germany contribute to tax.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information on the Turkish media again shows how deeply it has since been the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the efforts of a broad explanation and a reassessment of extreme right terrorism in Germany, this time the French word is lacking.
The bank of the Zurich lake scandal
The richest bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but not in Switzerland.
The UF almost entered the bank into the financial crisis, and since then a crisis has been eliminated.
Now it's headed by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think about it.
After its spectacular departure from the federal bank's summit, in July it was known that in 2013 it would start in a new and almost spectacular work: President of the executive board of the large Swiss bank U.S.A., an unexpected and successful step in its career.
Axel Weber is happy publicly, hails Switzerland for its beauty and to the U.S. for its recent acquisition of stability and lets you drop kindly comments on your future partners.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all banking security systems and spent EUR 1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, director-general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the U.S. Governing Council has since been considered also touched, and all have asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber should advise the bank since February 2012.
It will be responsible for the presidency of the Administrative Council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and counsellor and has had a certain adaptation period.
The strike is responsible for a bank's strategy, which has just proved to be worth the title "the largest bank in Europe's scandal" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until recently it was the world's largest asset administrator, and on the other hand, since years, it has gone down from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it looks like it's saving him to the old so proud Swiss bank.
It started the financial crisis.
The USB had a great reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss administrator of discreet and solid goods, but also early, combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the link of the world's big banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, former banker and later banker in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one asks: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, he left the light that something went very bad in the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, Director-General, who has so far been regarded as a great and very intelligent banker, gave up.
A few months later, the reason was questioned.
The bank’s investment fund was in losses with high-risk securities and had to be amortised by billions.
To carry this out, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found inverters, of course, some looked at with contempt so little before: an Asian state fund and an Arab state fund, so discreet, which had never been heard of.
This was just the first shot.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of thousands of millions, Marcel Ospel, President of the Administrative Council, in 2006 in the second best paid Administrative Council in Switzerland, declined.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investment, the UPR was in the financial crisis before the crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank has bought UU for many billions of dollars, the Helvetica Confederation has given six billion francs for a legally convertible bonus, which would become the bank's co-ownership.
All Switzerland was affected, the dramatic fact that it was for a small country, if it accommodates such large banks.
Finally, the EU balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times more than Switzerland's economic results (see chart).
"We can't rescue the U.S.," said Geiger, a bank expert.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, the U.S. U.S. took the lead in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data to the affected customers, who may have been taxing with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approved a figure of $780 billion, reimbursed for the unjustifiable benefits of these businesses with a payment compensation.
As a result, U.S.A. confessed that it had helped in the tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: aurea de Discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the President of the Board of Directors and the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through erroneous speculations and in the administration of goods through the aid to tax fraud.
And just when it came back to being something calmer, just when it was thought that the U.S. would get it back, it happened this dedicated story of the operator, an individual operator spent 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And, of course, this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"In the case of Aboboli it is shown that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Bankary Institute of Zurich University.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the U.S. is that it does not control risk controls."
Therefore, the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers have been present for a long time, is to be the guardians of the world's greatest goods: no risk too great, rather, the security of money wants to be cut off on the other side of the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss bank security deposits were the symbol of insurgent reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The Zurich UU centre does not match the Swiss private bank's click, it's just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat on the Baynhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes directly from the main station to the lake of Zurich, marked by snow covered by the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are hosted, the rentals are one of Europe's highest.
Here there are toys like Tiffany's among Swiss traditional businesses such as Sprüngli's appreciation.
The Swiss banks have lived here for years: from the national bank, passing through the House of Credit Suisse, to the private elite banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the U.S. reception room through a heavy gate.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, there are large leather rings in front, along with the bank logo there is a large letter to indicate "safe".
The U.S. knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the U.S. and Credit Suisse, have, for some time, moved the idea of the large Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank.
It prefers not to read your name in the newspaper, at the end and at the same time, as all Swiss banks, as well as the businesses of both large banks.
The U.S. has become too big, it thinks, especially in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have won land.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons for a long time."
In fact, the UF has changed the English investment bank, given its first great gain and then the disaster, no European financial entity had lost both money in the high risk jungle and the large Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"This miracle, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lucas Hässig in his book "The U.S.-Crash" ("The Crash of the U.S. in Spanish").
Politicians contributed up to 68 billion francs or about EUR 45 billion to save the bank's large bank.
How's it going?
We talk to Swiss banks, so see the problem in the U.S. dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks were merged into a powerful consortium.
It runs a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
It therefore served to complement the two different pre-currency banks of the UU: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a stronger but stronger internationalization.
In the meantime, the internationalised investment banks arrived at an opportunity with a lot of money, with which they could make a big financial bike run.
There are two names related to this rise of the U.S.: Peter Wuffli, head of the U.S. Board from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the Administrative Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuition that made it open from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel became Wuffli.
And finally Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly: Desatino arrived before the case.
The U.S. employees clearly agree with the directives meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the corporation, always repeated the same theme: Bajar from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
They headed the League Tables, the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The U.S. wanted to be in the tomb.
Some steps went well.
The exchange operations and the negotiation of actions were at the highest level.
However, business consultants in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language 'fixed in come', there is a huge compensation for large banks.
The U.S. is empty in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the U.S. began an adventure that almost costs you your existence.
The same bank as one of its high-risk funds created in US high-risk investments were in short-term growth.
He turned into a powerful machine to title American mortgage credits and then sell them, maintaining certain risks to his own account.
And also, like other banks, he's been looking for the download for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was in calls, the U.S. bought there," said Geiger, a bank expert.
So big the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to go, as his attempt to order became more complicated than they expected.
Positions in the UF have become projectable and are uncertain to date.
Currently, who runs a large bank, he has almost impossible work.
A strategy for a bank must be found, before all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on the administration of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get so far ( Still).
But the investment bank must decrease much, it is now clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Suijsu was thought to be a transitional solution, since the bank was miraculously separated from its predecessor Grübel.
However, he insists: The U.S. business must be managed permanently, the Zurich bank communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank to its state by mid-19th.
Remove 3,500 posts.
But that's not enough.
The U.S. needs a vision.
Who is it?
What does he want to earn money?
These are the questions that are sure to be done by Axel Weber right now.
Until then, he only says that he will first find a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Therefore, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks from its point of view.

Intelligent grasses flourish in cities
In many places the grass is considered "problem pairs": these intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some people like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grass has been in the city's image for years, but in many municipalities the neighbors' complaints are collected for the perpetuity and the noise of the animals.
Although there has been no means against the "problem pairs" so far.
Gracies are no longer coming out of the cities, say experts in the first ski symposium in Leer, East Frisian.
There, experts from all over the national territory are discussing possible solutions.
Find alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected grasslands; chemical applications in agriculture have apparently ended with traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, the growing building and the fall of trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
Gracies are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 players in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project was launched by the negative headlines of the press to kill in mass at the grasslands of the district.
Critics have qualified the hunt of animals by trappings for birds and killing with trees as particularly brutal.
"Expulsioning them and feeding them normally nothing is achieved," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or shooting trees is often an undesirable consequence, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert in Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals disappear, the great colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Helping them is only imagined as an exception to hospitals, the residences of elders or colleagues.
"We must live with them, we can't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, according to Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of sheltering animals in sensitive and green residential areas is possible for them to be relocated elsewhere.
"Intellectual panels instead of chains of chain" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologa makes advertising against the purpose of dealing with animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a piece in the face with a tear."
Jürgens buried Schleswig-Holstein in the Ascheberger's teaching circuit, where letters tell about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on criticisms about the noise of birds: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grasses not only take advantage of the resources for accessing shells, but they do not make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, astronomers at Cambridge University tested in four degrees to the extent that birds' intelligence reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a polar bear.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and manner of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second test, the fatty acids should solve a complex problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a purple sheet in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get to their trap with the pike.
But the investigators left them a piece of silver.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tuber.
Three of the four degrees achieved it in the first attempt.
Portugal in Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Christian Ronaldo
Bosniaks and Turks do not have any hopes in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have posted the latest tickets for Eurocopa 2012 in Poland and Ukraine on the playoffs.
Guided by the Christian Triunfante Heroe Ronaldo (8., 53), Portugal appealed to Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the age party, made the following five Eurocopa participations.
The checkers obtained 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off game with the outside Montenegro, after that in the game of Ida (2-0) they gave the clear things.
Croatia did not allow it to be marked in 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland received a flow 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80).
The former professional of the Bundesliga, Zvjezdan Misimovic with a criminal (41) and Captain Emir Spahic (65) took twice as far as Bosnia.
She obtained a red card (54).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Playoffs.
At the Lisbon Light Stadium, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo performed a direct release of more than 30 metres to put his head on the points.
A quarter hour later, Nani showed her dolls to mark from far and reached 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who didn't shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the poet Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of the English Manchester City, sent a head to the tree, but the balloon did not cross the gate line (33).
Jiracek has been prepared for the Czech Republic
Next, Wolfgang Stark, from Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack at Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penal area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card to get to the ground (36).
On the opposite side, Stark launched a criminal dispute after Fabio Coentrao's action, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European win-campament clarified all by 4 pounds.
The checkouts ended with the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek gol.
The 1976 European champion is ranked fifth consecutively for the Eurocopa.
The trainer's team Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaire Michael Kadlek (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (FC Nürnberg) also had success and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the porter Petr Cech avoided a possible hole in the own door of Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more possibilities with both Stefan Young and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked at the 40th minute of the turning of the border, very just at the port of Cech.
After the rest of the checkies had to protect the length of the world's famous port, the front of the FC Seoul returned to escape (50).
Finally, before the end the party was sentenced.
In the meantime, Turkey failed to take advantage of Zagreb's football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not move from 0 to 0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that the national trainer Guus Hidddink should leave his seat in the world's Third World Cup in 2002, Croatians held their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a principle of silence.
In the seventh minute and with a long break, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to send the balloon inside the gate either.
After the second reaction, Croatia took control more and more.
After the break, Croatia didn't let them put any balls on it.
Together with Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who, in the 62nd minute, made a site in Ivan Perisic, Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern de Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapatoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish held their first participation in the Eurocopa since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of trainer Giovanni Trapatoni, who raced with the 4-0 in the age party prepared for a previous decision, put himself in the head at 32 minutes.
Konstantin Vassilijev (57.) was affected by the host team.
Ireland was pressed from the beginning, but it had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had his first great opportunity.
Since the first time, the defense season has avoided possible advantages.
But in the 32th minute, he made it.
After a defense from the porter Pavel Londondak, Ward appeared and hit the balloon through the line, getting 1-0.

Mask to Personal Level
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "starts with a long personal drama of the kind that can make one's soul fall to the feet.
Here I have some action advice: slowly start this page and convert it into your page brand.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelistic narrative, and this personal drama will work as your GPS, a thread during those few moments in which, as one of your men and women, you are confused and disappeared in the clouds of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he wrote here is a little running book, which describes exactly as "an anti-historic work".
It contains some remarkable names, important treatments or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not just a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feels, impressions, experiences and moods".
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines experiences in times of war with more than 20 ordinary men and women, both sides of the war, from colleges and botanical to scalers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrations.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or they will lose their members, become crazy or die.
Their lives are here like votive eyes in a church; some new ones add to the mix while others close.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the books of standard history.
It is also correct in the sense that World War I was only the sudden war of droughts in the western front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" moves expertly through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the east front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
To the soldiers in this book they fall upon the hills; one passes through the wilderness in Egypt under the pyramids; the mosques are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war takes the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina that strikes the heart.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, do you stay or cry?
Who comes anyway?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, not even why they have to fight this war.
"Charence of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "has been filled with concepts, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of speculation, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" continues to individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German mariner from the high sea fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of his memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of your life may be terrifying or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privacy and order them with what they have.
About telling the story of a German collegiate says, "Sucedanes, for all parts of the Sudan".
"Café, false aluminium, imitation rubber, paper sales, wood buttons."
It continues to speak of the Swedish food in Germany.
Describes "cooked meat made from cooked rice and pressed in meat fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and leaves of dried potatoes; shoes with wood soils".
Here, note, "837 meat-producing substitutes, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse to rescue and manifests war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are designed and not to sit in cells with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or the best seller, and to claim that that this barnitz means civilization and that there is no barbar behind that frozen and tachyoned stone."
Instead, a British soldier is aware that he will probably die and that no one will be buried or imported.
"Once a person is dedicated to the thought of sacrifice, he would like to think that it could happen before the public," he writes.
On the contrary, it looks awfully "to a convicted person being kept secret".
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become more and more economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
Reflect on the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young animal: The killer in a ecstatic mass and ideologically convinced with good packaging clothes that executes his fleshyness while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both innocuous and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who were actively trying to catch a veneer disease of prostitutes as a way to avoid service in the front.
"The greatest expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonocotics, which soldiers buy and emulate with it their genitals with the hope of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate ask him about their eyes, which often leads to a life-threatening blind."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extraordinary, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way the war is "sustained by extremely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels such as Unnewed in front of Erich María Remarkque, instead of comprehensive stories.
The volume of Mr. Englund's joins in a little conventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he had come from his book, started from between your fingers that page of personal dramas, and burned it with a mirror.
After a false step, a minute's scheduled trigger
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing anti-disturbious helmets.
He was selected on Monday night at Tuesday because the Zuccotti park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining in an exercise.
The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, and his presence stressed how the operation was facing challenges for the police department.
It was impossible to repeat recent weeks' episodes, such as the piantic spraying on the exhibitors, infringing the department's standards and creating a public sympathy storm towards the "occupies".
And that's why the police operation to detonate the Zuccotti demonstration park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had been prepared to see how jobs in other cities had been developed.
A major disaster simulator was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called emergency training - counter-terrorism measures that involved moving quickly to a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on the night of the moon, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came in the "last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "a exercise".
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them what it was to get into Zuccotti Park," the person said, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to the Zuccotti park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secretism was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, some agents wanted to disarm the park, but they disappeared when hundreds of demonstrators arrived shortly after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually used to unload the bars with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, such as those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do so when I was the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Cars of the Emergency Service Unit with focus and loudspeakers gathered at the Pike Slip Cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages that had come back from the heights seemed to scare many demonstrators.
Community affairs officers were in the park with their clear blue shorts, many exhibitors simply collected their things and were gone.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other staff were seen meeting at the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave it.
Paul J. Browne, head of the Department of Police, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they were trying to prevent the police from entering the park, and that they had been treated harshly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units in Church Street, along the western border of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved to the west through the intense miracle of the personal effects of the exhibitors, including paper and plastic bags cut off, the crew of the Department of Cleaning followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, showing images on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A central group of demonstrators took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the centre of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them mechanically.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter were running between them by their arms.
And two people fell into trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service officers were called to cut down the candidates.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The waste operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were "adaptation of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest rank officer in the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department detectives, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, while I was present, "I wasn't conducting the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents waited along the east side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty and Cedar, if they had to enter.
They were raised on the Cortland street, a block north of the park, and on the Pine street, a block south.
From these positions, he saw the police expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti park.
At a given moment, a number of agents, many of them with shielded eyes, were seen pushing people outside.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most gruesome action of the night took place in the south of the park.
About the 5th century B.C.E., on the south side of the Pine Street, a manifesto jumped over the head of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from the streets of a police van.
At a given moment, a piece of arrest came out flying from the crowd.
Finally, an agent and a manifestant were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will demand the city for the displaced
The union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to ask the city for mercy, claiming that the missing were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that are dealing with poor students.
The demand is possibly the last weapon available to the union, from the 37 municipal district, in its effort to withdraw the displaced.
Sixty-seven and two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees who were among the poorest paid by the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that the union leaders described as a political advantage for their refusal to allow, the past spring, access by the city to a health assistance fund for working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically rejected this charge.
In a hearing in the Association last month, the Education Adviser, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the disbursements were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council objected to saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff would be dismissed.
The officials of the 37 municipal district said that they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be requested. A press conference will be held to announce the official submission of the claim at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The claim will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as accused and has eight dismissed workers, all black or Latin women, as the majority of those who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the City Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the demand and could therefore not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a claimant of the demand received by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of displaced persons in the schools of poor areas in the city to support a claim for unjust treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, since they had been chronically subsidized.
It is noted that although there were no dissidents in Staten Island and a few dropouts in schools in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in the Districts 8 and 9 in the South of the Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight employees employed by the 36 Public School in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim says, "This is not a barrier to parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The budget of district 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way in which additional funding was calculated for each poor student matrix in schools.
The union also claims that secondary school directors may have been deceived by language in a memorandum that permits parent coordinators to pass.
The memorandum used the word "exceeding" to describe the action, although "excessed" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school's appointment to a work bag whose wages are paid by the central office.
"Six hundred and six parent coordinators were fired," said the plaintiff of the complaint, "and not just in the past."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats in the Chapter are finally willing to agree on something related to the rise in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion was successful, that the veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi was captured and killed and the United States' participation reached its end.
On Tuesday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate will consider a resolution sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrated by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republic of Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (depending on Connecticut), hailing the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the US troops for their "validity".
"This resolution is to honor Libya's volunteers, when they start rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It's a statement of bipartidist support for its democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, both parties' legislators fought each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of U.S. military in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorising the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was broken in the Chamber by a broad bipartidist margin, which never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day that the bill was rejected in the Chamber, the camera also rejected a measure that would have reduced the funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress it's quite complicated as to criticise the management by Obama of the mission, but not as angry as to actually dry the grass under its feet.
The decision of the Congress was subsequently exceeded by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was murdered on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs " commends the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "delegation to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya by their extraordinary courage and professionality".
The resolution also stated "the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs be given to the new measure, or will it divide the legislators into the draft law of June?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the chief Republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other hand, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republic of Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that is actually a vote of all the Assembly in the Chamber or the Senate at this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded until now in making their amendments to the Assembly, but not due to attempts.
Goodlate is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the Chamber and in the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budget balance only in the Chamber, and another sentence that "will control federal expenditure."
Some of these draft laws are also identical to one another, but they give their sponsors - especially the new republicans who seek to finalize their curriculums - the opportunity to tell themselves that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, required that both the Chamber and the Senate vote for an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can perform, while representative José E. Serrano (democrated by New York), wishes to remove the two mandate limits for the Presidents.
The representative of Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrated by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a Peruvian proposal, as well as a ban on gang smoking.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that the members have been at the time of proposing amendments, they are not moving to a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and presented 66 to 110.
The rate is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly presented more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Golped but Not Destroyed," Giffords talks on his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in a firefighting act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrated by Arizona) appeared on national television on the night of the moon, sang along with Broadway's melody "The sun will rise tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that broke his skull and crossed the left side of his brain, and passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the House in surprise to issue his triunfant vote in the debt bill.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, he killed six and shot 13, Giffords smiled, sang and sang - and described his recovery as "hard."
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "That's good."
The interview with Giffords and his wife, astronomer Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20/20" for an hour, which was released the evening of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope".
The special programme reviewed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head covered and a long scarring through her face.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband is alive.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting in a street chair while the therapists teach you how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A cut of lips.
And then his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "tossed", a change request in his breakfast menu.
Videos distributed by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: You see the congressman singing with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wwana Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spent two hours in therapy every day, he said he didn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper on the murder of 12 March when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being drugged by the force while waiting for trial.
"Many people died," Giffords said to Sawyer.
"Good, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been ruined."
"So, I said to him, '' Gabby, you haven't been defeated,' said Kelly.
"You've only been hit.
And you're gonna get out of this, and you're gonna get back and you're going back with more strength than ever."
The troops make me feel more love than I respect
The event was a wave of Wall Street that cost millions of dollars to homeless veters in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ball on impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, mariners, pilots and marine children broke into their positions around him.
The majority of labels were put on their feet.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the recovery of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the Gala, also known as then the President of the United States, Almir Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They showed them as a sort of gerfan child," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
They had them.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was love.
Remarkably contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and a U.S. public often far away, sometimes worshippers.
The trophies are sold with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the service members say.
The public is increasingly acting as if those uniforms were to be punished.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way that some show their support is to put us in the role of the missing souls."
The theme is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or in disagreement with the public to whom they serve.
It is also noted that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the talks on the lastic are held in silence and in private between war veterans.
After their two children returned to fight the Navy Children, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear due to encountering insurgents and traveling to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a "injurious and violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his search for employment, he said, he felt that some interviews had asked him out loud if he could be able to stand under the pressure of a demanding work in Washington immediately after his battle race.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative impressions," Kancian reminded her children.
It raises military concern, in part, of the United States' indivisibility to wars.
The achievements in the field of combat are rarely chosen for the praise of a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were common in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who ordered U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of turns they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to end violence
This week, a historical hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passiveity before the rape.
If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the following.
The first soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said he was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and was headed back to his quarters in the Miramar Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who had a 12-page beer pack.
He asked her if she could join her in her room to take a cup.
"It's a alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, the native of Texas left one side of its concern.
I thought, no, she's 19.
"It's Texas," he says.
"Oh, I'd have listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him behind, dragging him down and raped him, he said.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the request they have filed against the Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The claim was that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the generalized violence between the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the demand initially involved 17 applicants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claimed that they were raped or raped sexually by their partners, and that the army failed in the time of investigating, processing, or administering appropriate justice after the alleged aggression.
Burke says he's going to the army's biggest plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure up to the bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of repressives? The High Command."
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom may be part of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating all applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same trap, so it will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defence, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to dismiss the case.
The court's documents, obtained by Newsweek, provide details of the defence strategy - essentially, that soldiers cannot be questioned by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered by the armed forces.
For a judgment of the Supreme Court of 1950 called Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged damage is part of the military service of the applicants," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, military women's teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: 150 military women have died and two thirds of them have been killed in combat situations.
It's time the army is also modernized, says Burke.
She's not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are on her way, in addition to her.
At Yale Law School, the Legal Services Clinic for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academys for alleged promotion of a mission environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army that focuses on the “personal personality disorder” diagnostics assigned to victims of violence in order to give them the high service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a complaint in December against the Administration of Veterans, accusing him of discriminatory practices in the way he handled claims of benefits for persons who said they had been sexually engaged in the service.
Nine draft laws have been submitted separately to the Congress by a bipartidist mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the aggressions are markedly low, and due to the own estimates of the Pentagon, which are estimated at about 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the processing index: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army were judged - half as in the civil justice system.
The complainants in the case of Burke described their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged violation of the military police less than an hour after it was happening.
That night, he said, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She was subjected to a cat of rape, and the blood of her attackor--from a cut in her arm--was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended an hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sexual relations with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared themselves to be witnesses of personality on behalf of the author's claim, which was finally absolute.
"I remember the day the Verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work. I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the Psychiatry unit, and when I went out, I remember I told my command officer, "That wasn't his judgment, that was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which he did not qualify for service.
In January 2010, the service was granted under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents it from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case submitted by Lyman and his demand partners continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of Law at the George Washington Faculty of Law.
However, she said, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What is interlocuted between them and a verse is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and disappointment that it has to bear responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strong against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not go on its way, Burke, a lawyer of the applicants, will put his other hundreds of applicants in charge of future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this subject until the reform is done," he says.
"until we're tired, what's going on first.
The walls have eyes: How the researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that reflected his anti-immigrance views online.
The moon, Breivik, who admitted to having committed a murder in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public hearing.
While Breivik could have acted alone, he was far away from being alone in the cyberspace: he had spent most of his time in front of his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can I find them?
Easy - you just have to enter Facebook.
"We realize that it wasn't so hard to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recent report on European digital population by the UK study centre DEMOS.
The Facebook personal information alliance is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their demographic characteristics desired with a scientific precision - the way vendors have been using it for years.
The Bartlett team found half a million fans of right groups throughout Europe and then led them to announcements, but instead of connecting them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon reaching Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not of all surprise: Right-wing players tend to be young, male and disabled by immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the screen of the computer".
The work of DEMOS is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends such as those expressed in "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is creating an increase in research, stimulating the number of academic works with the name of the site to almost 800 per cent in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you cannot approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to contact people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go through the game, and they'd never let you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that--go straight to them."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that university students who spoke of their drinking habits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with drinking than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that students, such as resident advisors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishs too many state updates with his drinks.
"You can't handle a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Children's Health, Behavior and Development Centre in Seattle Children's Research Institute, said Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinching" its own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and the Valentine's Day, the expected electoral participation in mid-2010 legislative period, and a National Welfare Index (mainly using information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders have long been claiming that the site should make available to others its vast amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - the sacrifice to be able to play the Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to share your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users pass on to form part of an investigation that they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data out of line, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think that many of the users have even thought that a researcher could be examining his profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that conducted with the public studies of students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then it's the question of methodology.
Even outside the line, there is no guarantee that a research topic is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the profile of a user and of the wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two things completely different," says Selwyn.
That is why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a subject paper and a bibliography are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to the real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about society - and a lot of society is still going on outside the line."
"Free and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter of "resistance" during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Temple Cabals," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I object to the court, because he received the mandate of organizations that support ideology of hate and because he supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't say I'm guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views".
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech with advance, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik under custody for 12 more weeks, prohibited him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities should have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that it was hidden under the veil.
All attended with the aim of moving forward towards the conclusion.
"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor to the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed with a dark and blue robe, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors at the eyes when he entered and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a greater "resistency" movement, the judge decided that it was not a mental illness, and said there was no evidence that he was acting with complications.
It is possible for some to advise you that the attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically ease the pain and confusion that any nation still feels.
"I'd like to look like a monster, but it doesn't look," said a family member of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seemed."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' loss interview, are shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished from the genius of technology like the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple's fans could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently discovered that it has been developed as an advance of a series of special projects in the major markets this week, is how much she understood this creative thought about the commercial processes and flow of work of the products.
It was no doubt a self-recognised designer, dreamer and hippie, but it was also a meticulous organizer and a nyk of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives would suffer "a disease consisting of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the personal computer trees, and he sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time, Jobs had been forced to leave Apple for 10 years, and he had been working hard on his new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete copy of VHS was found in the manager's garage.
This archive material, slightly re-edited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The interview has been lost for 68 minutes, which comes to the movies Landmark this Wednesdays and Thursdays.
For someone known for hating the interviews in depth, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and trade strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points across the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly covering his thoughts, seeking accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism seems to go to the surface, where it seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, prompting him to go faster to the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something remarkable prophetic in the lost interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing good and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of the computer.
One thing is to read posthumously reviews of Jobs' career, but there is something cruel and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after explaining everything with details here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of the missing interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"For years in business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" And the answers that give you in a way that's amazing are, "Oh, that's just the way you do it."
No one knows why he does what he does, no one thinks about things very deeply in business.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Unconstitutional by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good copper, and that was then adapted to a "variable" - developed an automated factory that would ensure that the commercial costs could be determined in detail.
About the pope's joke:
Jobs tells the "Caja Azul" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to hack effectively the telephone company and make calls for a long distance free of charge.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here describing the Blue Box as an act of power is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tried the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from an AT & T network to another, while creating a bottle with the largest number of satellites possible.
"We were involved in things around the world half a dozen times and cried through the public telephone and returned a minute later on the public phone from the door on the side," Jobs said with a smile.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
Both of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there would have been Apple without it.
Jobs continued to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost left, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two stood in custody just before Father himself was awakened to answer the phone.
About loving technology (and selling it by phone with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, at the backyard of spare parts to build a frequency counter, he found Bill Hewlett on the phone and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs received a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company that had seen that age and formed my vision of what a company was and what they were dealing with to their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where I saw "the first table computer never made."
It was as big as a suitcase, I had a small cathode tube screen, and I loved it.
I would make a trip to HP as a teenager and lose time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the road.
Soon in his career, as he was dedicated to selling a base plate, he asked a client if he could mount all the equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the installation and delivery of the completed devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer train:
"I agree to have dramatic arguments... they shouted to me that it would take five years [to create a rat worth $300], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Nine days later, we had a rat that we could build for $15 and that was completely reliable.
On major companies losing strength:
Long before Apple's rebirth led, Jobs prophetically predicted the way many industry leaders would trope in their vision and lose control of their market share.
"Tell me you work in IBM or Xerox, so you're making better photographers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly on the market quota, so the company has no more success.
Sales and marketing departments increase the success, so they are this kind of people who end up leading companies and product users are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The gene of the products that led to this monopolies position was released because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary office.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have been introduced from all the computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of the victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it evolves the great idea, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of itself.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do to make electrons, glass does them, robots do them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end, it reduces to pleasure - it refuses to try to expose to the best that a team of people has done, and then try to adapt these things to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing big ideas.
What he did most to Macintosh was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were sometimes the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for the computer, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas eat with the transgressions of health assistance law while the court accepts the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met at the closed door to discuss the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge of President Obama's health assistance law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were detained at a stage sponsored by the lawyer's signature that would expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was the past Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to carefully study the review requests.
One of the cases in question was a request submitted by 26 states to challenge the total reform of the health assistance approved by the Congress last year, a law that has been a call for war for conservatives throughout the country.
The judges agreed to accept the request and, in fact, an historic petition is expected for 5 hours and an average by March, and the outcome will probably further disturb the 2012 presidential career, which will be fully supported at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will state that the law must be repealed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. general tax during the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's Lawyers' signature, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped to patrol the federalist Society's annual dinner, a group that spent many years in defence of conservative legal principles.
Another sign that it sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represented one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Trades.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the fight.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the preliminary hearing of the court on the case.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opposition to health assistance law.
Special guests at dinner?
There is nothing new: The two judges have been attending the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's nothing but conflict with ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did not, they could be said to fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge may attend events to collect funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an guest of honour, or appear in the program of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was sufficient to alert ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive break of ethics and indivisibility towards the code is contrary to the demands of several judges who deal with the court by the same rules that apply to all federal courts," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were charged with a collection of Gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event prompted any request for impartiality, and it was unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticisms that say that the court's activity is too easily mixed with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Gini, is a highly conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservators argue that it is Master Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the general prosecutor of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges were presented to the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to avoid seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as for now being impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
The Emmirates Airport requires 50 double-pass Boeing 777 aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation worth over $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company receives a request from 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the sale price for 50 planes rises to a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine in the growth of future flight requests.
In a study on the moon, Chicago's company estimates that in the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest request for commercial aircraft for his value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 double-pass.
The successful request came from the Emmirates Airport in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total sales price to $26 billion, Boeing announced in the Dubai Aeronautic Room 2011.
Then, Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, called Dreamliner, which assumes a fuel storage and services for spectacular passengers.
The sales price for six of them is over $1 billion.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," said the analyst of Morningstar Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - generally harmful to air lines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is gaining money with increasing oil prices.
That is important because they have less likely other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Diora said.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emmiratos strengthens Boeing's leadership in the broad-fashioned aviation market and helps keep his competitor Airbus SAS from invasing his domain with the A350 passenger plane.
Boeing's victory in the air fair occurs four months after Airbus said that it would delay the start of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the start to add more momentum after customers demand an increase in the useful load and range.
Boeing Co's shares amounted to $15 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, in the opinion of the vote taken by Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug dealers helped his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor's content.
The sister of President Philip Calderón seems to have lost her application to the governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she said the moon that drug dealers helped to mark the race for one of her opponents.
The preliminary results provided the front in the career for the governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all, yesterday is alarming, not just for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after the vote on Sunday.
"They joined our candidates, our electoral workers... were supported by the Urnas, set up a barrier... and ordered the people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until the presidency was lost in 2000.
However, it is the scene of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have passed a few march to Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate of the Conservative Party of National Action of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate for leftovers by the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PPD, who is currently in charge of the governor's duties, remained in third place, a great defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize preliminary results.
Vallejo, exalcalde of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been dominated for a long time by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the born state of President Calderón, and he elected Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
Violence, however, has endured.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the elections while he was campaigning by Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates abandoned local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, because of the disgruntled appearance of the Michoacán elections, a victory will help to push the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the next year."
The BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has made an appeal to India and China to prepare themselves to help save the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Director-General of the Asian Development Bank with headquarters in Manila, said that the two world's largest growth economies had to "do everything possible" to speed up the recovery of the economic block already outside the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries observing the difficulties of Europe in a "comparably" way and said that Asia's financial assistance together with European leadership and resources would help to prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So whoever can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," said the Financial Times in an interview with the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected in a certain way, but can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, that's all the means."
The European monetary union has been seriously affected by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In the last few days, Italy's landing costs have been very low and Italy's first ministers and Greece's prime ministers have declined.
The current debt crisis in Europe has increased the fears that it might push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to unite to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but he said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue funds, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided more negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
And Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone because its own economy was now suffering from the decline in exports and the loss of foreign capital revenues.
"No one wants the euro area to be unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to keep a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India are not responsible for helping rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the University of Brown in the United States, said it would be politically difficult to sell help to Europe for the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people in India, of whom up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point, it will be noted that the Greeks are young at the age of 50 and go on vacations on the beaches and that will not work well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the large and well-paid public-sector workers in jobs of mismanaged enterprises, as well as those who have lost their jobs, such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened with "important chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now faced with "risks to low" due to Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "concentration plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant income from their economies.
Serious warnings of the Pentagon regarding possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, angered the Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts accompanying them could undermine national security and cause a financial reaction in chains from the steps of the Pentagon, to the Afghan war camps, to civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already approaching $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but I am now afraid of an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in shorts that could be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senator John McCain, Republican by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican by Caroline of the South.
He said that the failure of the Congress to reach agreement on the budget and its consequences would result in a 23 per cent global reduction and a high level of many new projects.
"A very large short, applied in this undiscriminate way, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible to be implemented - three quarters of a ship or building cannot be purchased - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to senators.
"We would also see ourselves obliged to disband many of our civil servants indiscriminately and, given that the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to legitimize civilians in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would break the faith of those who keep our army and seriously harm the good will."
The shorts with time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"Although the financing for wartimes in the accounts of contingent operations in the overseas are not directly affected by drought, the efforts of the war have been negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contract supporting the war."
"The nominee personnel would be reduced, leaving delays in payments to suppliers during the war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defence.
"The consequences of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly opposed to this dragonian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published the letter of Panetta.
"This is not a result with which we can live, and certainly it is not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen."
If the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or will intensify the calls for extradition to the Snippets Pentágon, you will see.
Panetta has been more and more frank about possible shorts, although she has reached work at the top of the Pentecost with years of budgetary experience at the Congress and the White House and knowing that she faced difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark panorama of what might be before - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a boat without mariners."
"It's a fight without bullets."
"It's a lack of trained pilots."
"It's a piece of paper, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening words at the Pentecost.
"It is a force that suffers from low morals, poor preparation and is unable to maintain daily with the potential enemies."
"In fact, invite aggression..."
In an addition to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta tells new details about how reductions " generate significant operational risks: still in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously restricting our ability to be deployed and committed in advance around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could face the challenge, including those already tested and some alone in the first stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the ballistic submarine of the new generation, the new coastal battleship and the new earthly combat vehicle that the Army and the Marine need to replace, the Humvee.
Detention of F35's development and additional evidence could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and cope with China's potential threats and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A view of the most recent headlines tells us when serious and overwhelming are deception and lies in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is engaged in exchange of sexual harassment charges with several women; each party claims to lie to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury by alleged hiding reports that a retired football trainer was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "played" with an open microphone saying to U.S. President Barack Obama, that Israel's first Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and confused countries.
Congressman by New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the argument with his rapidly rebuffed disappointment by the irrefutable test.
Former President John Edwards has been accused of crimes in the financing of the campaign related to the coverage of an extra-trimonial relationship.
And once again, no one who lives will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton has rejected while lying during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The legend of the trappings in school and university exams is very extensive.
Cases have been made in which teachers have given answers to examinations to students with a view to improving their performance assessments.
Men who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and lying are acceptable.
How stupid are we?
One day, studies show you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's sure, many of these lies are broken.
Another study showed that unknowns lied three times in the first 10 minutes to meet.
detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we all must acquire, for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of a table similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to declare: "I have", the detection of deception is a framework of knowledge that would be based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old lies about lying have been rebuffed.
The liars look at their eyes.
They don't always get tired, they're balbuce, they're bulging, or they're worried.
It cannot be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the declaration, microphasic expressions, questions-learning and times.
It has been several years since researching scientific discoveries about fraud in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of fraud is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate through our complex world - especially if its professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiation.
The good liar has the ability to read well to others, to make them feel good, to manage their own emotions, and to feel intuition as others see them.
We know from the research that extroverts think more than the introverts, that men say more "directed lies to themselves", while women say more lies "orientated to others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people often think less of their mates than those who are not married (but the lies they often say tend to be "ormous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty when lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual conduct of the subject.
This is called "creating a base line."
Help to provide reference points to measure after changes.
Note the position of the subject, rhysa and vocal characteristics.
It's better to know if someone normally hits his foot all the time so that he doesn't make unjust accusations when he sees his feet hit in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for false, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavior groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who deceive may freeze the upper part of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, turn to a exit, change their position in a significant way, or exhibit a "post-reviewal relief" -- that exaggerated breath of relief and change of position once all difficult questions have ended.
The questionnaires often fail to see that the interview has ended just to find that post-interview relief.
He also paid attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put the boat to the bottom and used the past time as he claimed his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who deceive can also use a remote language: "I didn't have sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or to repeat a difficult question in full.
The most common word indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I... understand."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to detect deception is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid being victimized by stage artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial oil waste plan after the threat of the United States delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened by delaying the approval of an oil pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infringing on the trade unions, while visiting ecologists -- the company that seeks to build the oil pipeline said it was ready to redirect the project to re-direct it.
TransCanada said the moon by night that it would move the planned oil pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandills area in Nebraska, and was confident that the project would win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Chapter of Nebraska.
The director of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says that the company maintains its confidence that in time the oil is approved, although it is true that it is with a different route.
This came after the announcement last week by the Department of State that the decision would be delayed by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes to avoid the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and Ogalla, a large subterranean water supply were studied.
"This is a real step forward," said representative Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review organized by the Department of State is possible to separate any decision by 2013, after the elections of the next year, although officials denied that the policy would be reflected in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed all its support.
The oil pipeline would extend from 1,700 miles [1,700 km] from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He would bring 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta's province to the refineries in Texas.
To that end, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the ecologists, but loved by the working groups, which have been set up by the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the oleoduct.
However, the Nepalese legislators against the plan are underpinning legislation to strengthen a derogation from the Sandhills region and Ogalla, the largest source of drinking water and irritability.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project had only had limited environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's general inspector had ordered independent evidence of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was the leader of Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is if a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle requested for alleged cause a child to cry out for fear
A New York family claims that the sound of the disc music, Patti LaBelle, acted as a place on the wall of her Manhattan building, landing her little daughter to the point that she was scared.
"Lady Marmalade"'s singer's diaphragm attended Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, as he suffered "personal changes, changes of dream" and "he increased his fear of strangers," says his family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10th last year when Tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, professor of childhood garden, and Genevieve was preparing for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was driving the car, Roseanna Monk descended from the building of Riverside Boulevard, with his crew, taking to Geneva.
Roseanna Monk said he stood near the door and put his daughter on the floor for a while.
"Someone approached behind and said to me, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes' and I went to take her,' he said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He became angry and began to use bad words - word C and word J in a loud voice...
I had a bottle of water and I started to draw the water from the bottle on me."
He said that Genevieve had a history.
"I told this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," the girl's mother said.
LaBelle complained about the mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be kept around and taken back to a car she was expecting, said Roseanna Monk.
The little one was crying so loud that he shouted, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but I didn't get an answer.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment on the incident.
The claim seeks for non-specific damages, but the family lawyer Sam Davis said that he took the case for free and that the family planned to give all the money that would provide support to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it comes to a child garden teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate change has brought the economy to an end
During the first year of the management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, undermining foreign investment and countering the economy
It is 2011 a year to be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated by the change, which generated great expectations for the progress in the economy, but given the climate adverse at the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but a deterioration is recorded in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions lost to the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, resulted in a contraction of overall economic activity of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the effects on the helms, issued by the Mexican Council on Sustainable Rural Development, damages were reported in 582,835 hectares, of which 78,03 per cent suffered total damage and 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main segregated crops were those of Hortalia, Maize and Garbanzu.
The fall in economic activity has generated a steady rise in unemployment in the state by November, according to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, during the first three trimesters of the year, an accelerated growth was observed, since between January and March 55,053 signals were unskilled, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate was 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in the number of people dropped to more than 74 thousand unemployed, an increase in the first half of 18 000 969 individuals.
Less liquidaz
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the U.S. Institute of Economic and Social Sciences, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions taken since public policy.
"What is seen is an increase in unemployment that has to be seen with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation adopted at the Congress to combat money laundering, since it is not easy for people who take money illegally to work, invest and use it in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad, in the United States, has been restricted, first because of the difficulty in entering, and secondly because they are already having many difficulties finding work, these people are staying and are looking for sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informationality
The analysis of the labour market signaloense increased by considering the high level of informality prevailing among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the working population in the state does not work as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, other than the labour wages of the state, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Prevention.
The average monthly income of the union workers was, by September, 5 thousand 352 weights, very below the national average, located at 7 000 375 weights.
IED Contraction
As a result of the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the increased reduction in the Direct Investment in the last 10 years is recorded during 2011, according to the State IED Economic Secretariat, 630,697 dollars, representing a fall of 87.74 per cent for the $5 million,143,312 registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the State Government Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million people per year, mainly by third-party enterprises.
Debt
At the economic contract stage, the Government of the State requested in July the State Congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, even though investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with a view to rehabilitating the economy, was by a total of 2 billion,600 million pesos, and until November it had not observed the benefits of the acquisition in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés showed a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Reform Industry, said that during 2011 there was no harmonisation of the will of the different sectors, including the State Government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been very poor, and we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012, we have to redouble efforts, and we have failed to align the efforts of all and, above all, the good progress of this new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López showed that events such as the beginnings of the year had stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is a product of several events, among them the heroes, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not return enough fast enough to generate an economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we are very close under our expectations," he said.
Redefined Call
For Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederal Confederal of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, indicated that the state needs to be brought to the attention of more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms, we have observed that work has been under way, and we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic course of the state is defined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource in Sinaloa is denied," he said.
Work to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better results from the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been working to achieve good results in various matters, with some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has made progress in its way of leading public policy.
"There are elements that allow the Government to say that it is more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I believe the Government is aware that there is work to do," he said.
They condemn him for 8 kg of marijuana
At five years of imprisonment and 100 days of plenty, a neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor General of the Republic reported that the convicted Narcommenedist was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, because of the health crime, in his Marigian possession variant for commercial purposes.
According to the expert AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010, in a surveillance operation on the Cipriano Valdez street in front of the 80th place in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The Narcomenedist circled on a truck type pick up, white color, where he carried a black bag in the car’s box and in the seat of the child a small mochila, where the soldiers found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured was made available to the District Court and the judge continued to remain in the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
You must make contributions to the work
Social work on programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants is at risk of not being concluded or having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, noted Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Mayor of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk not being met by the Government of the State with the contributions that correspond to it, which amount to over 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million, of which 25 per cent of the State was represented, and that only the Federation and the municipality had provided resources for the work, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of these programmes was made.
"It's almost 12 million what it takes to bring them, and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they have had to give us a part," he said, "we've started the work, and we're going to make a lot of progress, but we've got the money."
He noted that in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla last year, the State did not comply with their respective contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the State administration had not contributed on that occasion.
"We were already in the previous section because the State had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes were continuing, and this year we were able to access these programmes we had to get the resources to cover what the State had left behind," he explained.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to meet these resources, he commented that the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, had been made to speed up the management so that the percentages corresponding to them can be reached as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million what it's about to bring, and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid Court "analogous Apangón" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) condemned the constitutional contradictions between the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which went on to call the "analogous attack" from 2021 to 2015, when the eight votes needed to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed its mandate by issuing the decree detailing the following actions to specify the transition to the terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was disappointed by not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to speak on the constitutionality or inconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains true.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to state inconstitutional the decree, because the regulation of radio and television materials is a legal authority reserved to the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Coffetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and the reservation of law.
In favour of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives promoted two constitutional contradictions to impose the decree, and when the demands were accepted, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions in it available for digital transition.
The Plenary of Ministers also resolved to dismiss the request submitted by the House of Representatives, without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its intervention, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive could not structure the measures to prepare public administration through general standards.
"I also do not think that this would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and I recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the Federal Executive, who has constitutional authority, the State's directorate.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and is translated into a better use of radio spectrum, a better quality of signal and more channels.
To postpone change, support, would be to further the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "and may cover national economic, social, political and security issues".
These issues, he said, "need the operation of the whole system established, in accordance with the principle of state economic governance, includes a set of tasks which the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already concluded the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, when issuing the contested decree, which has somehow invaded the sphere of Congress's competence, is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, ensured.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote vote" content in Michoacán
According to the data collected by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, although the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 000 74 total are still not recorded.
The possibility of the "vote vote" content is a reality with regard to the electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, yet the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6 000 74 total.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Microacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Maria de las Angellas Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of lines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or his Electoral Justice Act, although the Congress adopted reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that they could enter into this electoral process, and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication at the time provided for in the State's Official Journal Act, with some objections.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invaluable and illegal" the State mandate for constitutional reforms, even though it does not have the right to "sanctify or punish them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "vote vote", Maria de la Angles Länder stated that, thanks to the approval of the relevant lines by the IEM General Council, it would be possible to make partial and total accounts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be made on the assumption that: the results of the acts do not match; there is no act of extraterritoriality and computer in the cashier or does not operate in the power of the President of the House; or, where there are evident errors or changes in the acts.
In addition, the total amount of the vote received in all election seats may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate in the election being dealt with and the second place in the vote is equal to or less than a percentage; always and when at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that has been sent to the second of the candidates indicated.
The total amount of the vote may also be carried out if, at the end of the ordinary term, the difference between the alleged winner and the second-hand candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as there is an express request by the representative of the political party whose candidate remained in second place, if the electoral packages that have been partially accounted for are excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation, the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and the second is only 0.16 per cent, although without accounting for the 129 votes of the 923 total acts.

Hours before the meeting, the military authority presented nine persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed in bullets in different parts of the body and with the shooting of grace, in a abandoned castle in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, New León.
The discovery took place at the 1.5 km from the road of Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.

One metre was the body of another person with a red plate and a blue mixture.
The three found their mouth down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three persons would have been killed elsewhere, as no shells were found on the site.

The new Italian government will form the miracles
The prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country at the edge of the economic disaster.
The first Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian president to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy at the edge of the economic disaster and has threatened the whole euro zone.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a Government.
It is expected that a agency composed of most of its technocrats will be present, although it is not clear when it will assume the new executive.
Monti said he would present the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that obstacles had been overcome.
"Marco is now well-delined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has caused the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must adopt a strong Austrian package required by European leaders to recover the broken confidence in Italy.
Under pressure on Monti to be taken, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonus to 10 years above 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were forced to be redeemed.
Emma Marcagagglia, leader of the Italian Confindustria patronage, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The chances of Monti's success were significantly influenced by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, in which the crisis was forced to leave on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to have a good outcome," said Prince Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Central Party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members have been opposed to the Government of the majority of technocrats that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be imputable austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks was forced to warn that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti started his consultations on political parties, unions and business groups on Monday, as well as on youth and women's organizations.
He'll end his round of meetings tomorrow night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitan, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would decline, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Delivering to Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the euro area.
Monti said that his Government should remain until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give time to implement the reforms before the elections are resumed.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the big parties insist that he should be trained only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process bound by financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that mutual mistrust and disputes among parties are challenging the attempt to include political figures.
The rose of the Spaniards is higher than the ticks
Of the 22 footballists called Spain, ten are based on 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 calls arrived at 50.
A mausoleum contrast to Costa Rica, if it compares the 22 calls by both countries for the friendly today at 3:05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While World and Europe's champions, number one of the FIFA's monthly rank, account for a wide range of class A interselections games, the Tricolor only holds the champion Michael Umaña as the only 50 international parties.
This figure reached her last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballists who play in the League of Stars and in powerful British Premier Clubs keep an intense activity in league and domestic football champions every year, and high-level shocks in European football games such as Championships League.
The experience with the Spanish Furia is previously taken into consideration in complex eliminations of the Eurocopa and the World of Football.
On the contrary, Turkish footballists have a limited international rock in a zone, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the maximum registration of the Spanish Selection is from the archer Íker Casallas, whose previous Saturday before England (debate 0-1 in London) matched the record of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play in front of the Tricolor today and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's Cerebral Flight, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, including, were recognized last week by UEFA along with the other centurions of the Iberian team, called Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's aerate Raúl González with 102.
Nearly the century's number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
The following are Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inniesta, with 62; Casc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tip side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artist Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five were over 30 parties: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santo Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not about 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson don't yet start.
The Spanish historical gorilla is David Villa, 50 days old, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two decades of trajectory tour
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream real"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Low Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band ensures that for them, the dream of playing in the country will also become reality.
So he assured the founder and founder, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the South American branch of its two-year workshop, and on Sunday 20 it will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, beginning at 7:30 p.m., with the English band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcription is in La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican followers, is it a dream fact that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what his fans are living in?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream real real for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I've been in Costa Rica only once and for holidays; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can stay there a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
It is asked because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensively in the days ahead.
What do they tell their most zealous followers?
Thank you for remaining on our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so much and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played during the last 21 years have happened during the last few weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're very eager to play there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its oils to survive?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a big friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are big places to surf; that's how we were buried, through people who love surf.
On seeing the race, they've come to deliver huge shows with many songs.
What have they planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched there before, then we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and different repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What does this have to do with you?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we're about not to touch, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons we liked these songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this giraffe, they're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagine we would be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years has made it look like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and feel much more that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world where we always want to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of the grunt?
It has always been an honor to be part of that large band.
We're very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's a little bit common.
From time to time, a band of a city emerges, but it is much more strange when five or ten gangs come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them once in a while.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains, and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we were lucky to be friends of all of them still and we were honored to be part of that Seattle sound that arose.
It is also very strange that a band like you remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, of course, is much longer than many gangs endure.
First of all, I think we're all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we're all worried about the others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, we have also opened up musical adventures that give each one the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other's music and can't be better.
Your relationship with the famous word has not been easy; however, thanks to its success, they have been able to do what they want.
How do they find a balance?
As we've grown, it's been easier to find a balance.
We make sure that you're not too giraffe because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowd and the people who love your music.
While one reminds you that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brings it, without being aware of being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Good?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something big.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a disc until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it would last so long and most important is that we were still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I heard a song or I saw a picture of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to talk about music and football and much more.
He was a wonderful human being, and we were surprised.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why they chose it for opening it?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer in life and should be very interested.
Why are Yellow Ledbetter's letters always changing?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
They're so many.
Among the first things that happened to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so many that I could talk all morning about the bastards who love me.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunt relevant despite being no longer a fashion?
I think that all of us always feel a little disconnected from the Grunge word.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all who came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are doing better now than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now became more positive.
What does this change mean?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that may look more novel, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe, which qualify as very dark songs even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I wept when I heard them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family or a friend, those things begin to influence your art and music and those two songs, of course, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is reintroduced for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength on the legs, he informed his head doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who served a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffered several diseases, including cancer in the language for which he had four times been operated and was kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Agunga, who is his personal doctor, told the TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and the loss of the strength of its lower members.
Agungaga commented that in her opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the offender for humanitarian reasons, however, said he did not want it because he knew it was innocent.
It was operated four times by cancer in the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms that has been associated with other pathology such as severe erossive gastritis, pancreatitis, renal calculations, arterial hypertension, and circulatory problems on the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 at the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army's anchoring squad that had been operating clandestinely in the first years of his government.
Music travel to Mexico to strengthen political links
An official committee, chaired by the President-in-Office of Uruguay, José Mujica, and integrated by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with its Mexican couple, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial and social authorities and a meeting with the collectiveity of Uruguayese residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "appropriate for the exchange of information on all political issues between the two nations", the South American Presidency published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France, when French ambassador Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of fiscal paradises, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened with exclusion from the international community to those countries that continue to be fiscal paradises, a statement that provoked Uruguay's refusal and called upon its ambassador to consult the European country.
Mexico President of the G20, an integrated group of the most powerful and emerging countries in the world since November, and has been with the South American country since January this year, a treaty to exchange tax information with a view to avoiding double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has tried to accelerate the conclusion of fiscal exchange agreements with a view to leaving the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that have not implemented all international fiscal cooperation standards.
From 2004 onwards, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between both countries.
The bigotuated font passes through the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, incansible, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the waves of evil Bowser, but he has never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month at the shops all over the world, has been designed from a principle to take advantage of the characteristics of Nintendo 3DS portal console, which allows to play in three dimensions without needing to use gloves.
"Mario is the character that has to say how stereoscopy should work without gauze," said Nintendo's specialized press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally thought for that support", since so far successful as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's portfolio has maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and flowing game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "scilla" to cover the less skilled users.
Once exceeded, the most experts can give a "second turn" to the level of the game, which this time presents more difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between a "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not overcome optical illusions".
This super Mario's three-dimensional investigation also suggests the return of the character to a portable console, which has not been produced since 2005.
In this video Nintendo leads the follow-up of the bag and repeats the formula of success of the previous deliverys, which is consistent with the fact that the bigote source will have to use high-risk platforms with the aim of releasing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news on the movements, the environment, the conflicts and the enemies and also a "jugable" Luigi.
Colom vála de Portillo extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced this morning that he had been betrayed by exorbitant Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy for the $70 million laundering.
It thus ends the process so that Guatemala will respond to the request from the northern country that she called for Portillo to judge there.
In a press conference, Columbus stated that his decision was subject to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court had already ordered extradition.
He noted that during his mandate he "did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and that he transmitted all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradite by murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Strada Morales and Victor Strada Paredes, both by drug trafficking.
The fact by Colom suggests an enforcement treaty that will then be seized by all judicial and constitutional authorities to process the claimant between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradite once its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was absorbed by the disappearance of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and responded to the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The nation's entity to avoid falling into the marginality of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to cope with a difficult situation throughout this quarter of the century.
This adds to the hundreds of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to balance an act held in the old factory complex of Fabra and Coats, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the village of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dograding or in the situation of falling into marginality.
The evening celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of responsible bodies and institutions that have collaborated with the association for the past 25 years.
The various political representations, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work performed by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ex-consulter of Socialist Education, Ernest Margall, and the vastness of the mayor and current socio-socialist council, Richard Gomà attended the event.
They also attended the great lab of Fabra and Coats, the current consultant for Social Welfare and Family, Joseph Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present is also it, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove an example of how to fight bad circumstances and how to hope people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the entity and to the work it is doing," he said.
Avoid a busy trap where macrofistes were made
Invasors had been brought up from 11 of the 13 buildings in Balmes, 51
The 12 employees left the prison the afternoon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the pesadilla that lives near 51 on the street of Balmes has reached its end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the property that they were dealing with illegally, and where they organized macrofistes that were desperate for neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from being restored.
"From now on there will be access control," said the administrator.
The jobs, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially the sides of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the multi-tudinal festivals, which lasted for up to two days and were desperate for residents.
On the side of the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied, the business has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the disc pointed out that the ship's invasivers had made it an unfair competition, since they sold the coins to three euros, while the disc was worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the opium area had had to respond to neighbouring complaints by noise, while, according to him, the disturbances did not cause the customers of the discotheque, but the residents of the house occupied and, above all, the attendees at the festivals organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in the last few weeks, according to the neighbors nearby of the area.
The discotheque officer explained that the disturbances were so large that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that "I forgive" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks, more complaints have been received by neighbors over the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group at the meeting, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately remove the furniture to end the problems of convergence and civilization that are causing neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant of the building occupied, but over the past few months the jobs had gone into all the buildings and almost all the spaces, and that in some of them there have been thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be guilty of the incisiveness that has been generated in the Finca".
Also yesterday, the Mossos left a building in New Barris.
At 15.30 p.m., the police headed up to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had noticed four people arriving at the building.
The four were arrested right now.
Why the mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity to call beyond the treasury polymetics
The municipal competition on 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
As of the 1980s, in full support of the already extensive Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration printed a package of Collserola's promotion.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of the Metropolitan Barcelona.
More than that, he was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York City Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park once again settled in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not guided on the north-south axis but up (mountain)-down (mar).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park turns up in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jaballis in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was until, in September, the association called for a megacompetition composed of 16 competitions for so many other ports of access to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of park, no doubt.
Or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, why or mountain?
The competition, both by its verent only organizational and by what it suggests reflection on the city, is the subject of conversation between all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost already a recurring theme to which to turn your hand when two members of this old election castle are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact just makes one of the few coincidences between the three Barcelona architects and university professors who have been presented.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Rollan, after addressing the litarian front "if necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", whenever the talk of Ildefons Cerddah, the green manganese, has not been carried out.
"It comes from the basis that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect was sentenced to whom the title of "Collseroola Doors" would create a "physical trap": it is not necessary to think about them "how access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where there is to be action".
Modol, like Rollan and Bayona with experience in the urban world, defines the proposal of "intelligent network" with "some dangerous".
Dangers arising from the "insure that it is today to design public space" after the experience in the 80s and that it was in the Forum area "your song of the cross".
The first fear is the own delimitation of borders on where to build.
"Limiting something is already fixed the next step," that is, its excess.
"It is necessary to think about new urban, planning instruments, because current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GPM)] may cause real disasters."
More to the question, Modol thinks that, simplifying, the veritable Valais of Collserola "can be understood as a park, the Barcelona, no", for a just topographic question.
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "shouldn't fall into chaos", although thanks to the opportunity that the association offers its greme to intervene in this project "from the first time".
And more, I understand that the approach of the mountain with the city is the rescue behavior that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile is what must lead multidisciplinary teams ("all accompaniment") that have been created: "Architecturals should be only one tool".
Bayona points out that the answer to the question entitled to this piece is complex, because on the basis of the competition there is a global view of Collserola: "16 cross-border competitions - say - in the sense of mountain-sea, but there is no long-term reading, which sees and understands the area in its entirety."
This, at least in its case, has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
In other words, a project for one of the doors can be hacked into program and definition with the architecture of the door on the side.
In its opinion, that is yes, the alliance should ensure that the franca immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgive Jonahs Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of arrest, the legal deputy of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Monterey mayor of the process that followed him for alleged songs
After staying for 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazabal will be released after the legal deputy of the Casino Red gives him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which continues a singing process against the brother of the mayor of Monterey.
After paying attention to Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas reportedly required him to pay an economic bill so that the regional association would allow the clandestine operation of the house of apothetes.
After the public complaint, the State Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the Panistal brother and was arrested and arrested for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Officer 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Barrio de la capital of the State.
There he remained for 49 days after a second order was issued after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs wished the crime of crime and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison mainly for singing with a million and a half weights to the owners of the Casino Red; however, he only stayed a few hours in the middle security detention because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the internal judgment in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, he received a letter of appreciation from the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months of aerguations had been tested enough evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the sum of 1.5 million weights to the representatives of the house of asylum instead of allowing the same operation.
This month, the legal deputy of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appealed to Judge José Luis Pecina to apologize to the brother of the mayor of the region, so he could recover his freedom in the coming hours.
During the legal diligence, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the partners in the house of asylum was the cause of the pardon, although the lawyer tried to book the name.
On the basis of the letter 197/2011, a legal apology is granted to Jonas Larrazabal and no claim can be made about the process followed; in addition, it will not be required to repair damage or punishment.
Following the hearing of the legal deputy of the house of apothecary, about 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Secretary of the Juzgado, Jorge Yánez, was transferred to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de las Garza to notify Jonah that he had been legally forgiven and his expedition will be archived.
He will also notify you of the order of freedom immediately issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gave details of the air accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more
The Department of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the result of the accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, lost his life, and seven more persons, indicated that the helicopter was directly affected on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to detonating the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were appropriate for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asps had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fossil."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it had to meet the requirements for transportation to staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was structurally present.
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, counting with appropriate requirements for transporting passengers.
The ground has a slope of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of tilt.
At the moment, the Secretary made sure that it was a priority to count the results as early as possible; however, the investigation could take several months, even one year.
On his behalf, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the moment of the impact, the helicopter of the Supreme President State was operating at cross-border speed and that this occurred in an emerging white land.
"This information strengthens the hypotheses of a normal cross operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the title of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautics policy the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, this means that the crew should have visibility during flight and land.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the ICM were subject to appropriate weather conditions, as the aircraft advanced to the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico were presented with low-level cloud layers.
Selected paths:
The crew is likely to have searched for a area of less elevation and greater visibility towards the river Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest record of the radar aircraft are consistent, probably before the impact was not lost control or change in flight trajectory.
Aeronautical waste dispersion in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact has taken place in a straight and side traffic.
The aircraft's waste disposal pattern allows us to assume that the helicopter was affected on the ground under structural integrity.
No evidence of the explosion has been found:
At the site of the nest there is no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been multiple contacts with the land.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an altitude of 9 000,200 feet above the average sea level, the ground has a pendant ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees inland.
The photographs show the sequence in which it is likely to be detached along that route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the minute search in a wider area than the site agreed to, around the accident, there have been no dispersion of the aircraft, which strengthens the assumption that the impact was presented under structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obsessive genes
Directs social security research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol, which will allow you to count with markers associated with obesity.
In a communication, Michael Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemicals of the National Medical Centre XXI, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by experts and postgraduate students from the National Institute for Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestät) of the National Politécnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate in whether or not the population is entitled to attend the IMSS participating sports units in the Gulf of Mexico, where testing is carried out for minors every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He noted that the Protocol had begun in the Cuahtémoc Sports Unit (México Ponente State) and that since 8 October, the activity was carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (México East State).
Once the objective of meeting 500 or 600 children is met, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independent (on the Federal District) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (on the north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research was to identify the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the occurrence of degenerative chronic diseases.
When the World Day of the Diabetes was held on 14 November, it was stated that the goal was to gather three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and previous inherited diseases, with a view to avoiding risk factors arising from diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It was explained that the Sabbaths were applied to all participating anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference), arterial pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (is sought to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is subject to the concern of health professionals by alarming weight increase in the minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that there was an increase in children only six years of age, 77 per cent in obesity, and 47 per cent in girls; a dramatic rise was also observed in terms of overcompensation," the IMSS expert noted.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers was supported in that the country's population was different from others by its genetic history.
It was reported that, on average, Mexico has 65 per cent of American Indian heritage, 30 per cent of Europe and 5 per cent of Africans, and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and weight gain.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity are translated into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calorie) and that is stored in a form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows them to detect if they have some degree of obesity or obesity.
Including, he said, the presence of obscenity (acantos) in the neck and front, indicating the probability that metabolic changes and even prediabetes occur.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors provide it in writing to the parents, who are explained to each of the measurements and changes in the life-style that should be made to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause excess, obesity and other chronic suffering: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and to use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric engineering, i.e. the highest consumption of sugard beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgese, etc.) with high content in fats and proteins and genetics that are analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid bugs
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the floor were heeded, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand baths per river season in the Metropolitan Area of the Gulf of Mexico, warning Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty (FQ), who ensured that if the construction and maintenance of an asphalt floor is the appropriate process, the baths could be reduced in quantity or, even, completely eliminated.
At its conference A technological opinion of the baches, based on the International Year of Chemicals, revealed that the laboratory in its charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera believed that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of baths.
He explained that the asphalt, the most heavy part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, some of the high molecular weight, called asphaltene, and others of low molecular weight, called maltens, which together give the floor its characteristic viscosity.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees represents a relatively solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, added.
The previous means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform, but it has changed during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist warned in chemical engineering.
The FQ investigator observed that the streets of Mexico City in most of them are covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve the asphalt.
Among the most surface layers is the asphalt folder, which is made up of small stone cut into asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that forms the folder, pointed, is bathed with asphalt.
When the vehicles are transferred and the effort is generated, this allows the forces to spread very well in the floor.
If modified asphalt were treated, it would be even better to dissipate, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asphalt folder, it is filled with a last layer called the rotary folder, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. an sand that also falls into the asphalt.
As is the case with the layer that will be in contact with the brakes of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
When the floor is part of the floor that will receive and spread efforts, the wheeling folder also requires the appropriate thickness and must be taken care of the material that is done.
The climate, particularly humidity and temperature variations, is also an important factor to consider, in particular water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground melts, the water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to escape, this is an occasion for a resurgence of all the layers of the floor and, therefore, the formation of baths.
In the process of training a baby, he said, the first time in spending is the film of rotation and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National System of Investigators also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the training of tyres and that therefore, the thickness of each of the tyres should always be relative to the vehicle load and ensure that they are met, in order to avoid frequent noise.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already in the market and allow for easy repair and without the need to use high temperatures.
What happened to Valle's candidate to be the new lady in Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that have taken place so that Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Mr. Colombia.
The Valle receives its title number 14 from the princess.
Again, the Valley of Cauca remains with the gains of the crown of St. Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being in the winning podium, lighting the silver crown and the band that they believed she was the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic lady grew up with the crown and the cetro, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina being joined by Valleucacan women who have been close to the crown but who were princesses among Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1989), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Rome (1993), Giselle Garcées Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garces Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many are asking is, What went wrong?
Because the result is the defeat of a great favour that in each presentation it showed that she had everything to be the new Lady Colombia, not in the bathroom she was elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalie Navarro who took up the crown of St. Columbia.
The first factor considered to be the key in the decision that the jury made to appoint her First Princess is radical in which he did not agree with his answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? did Martin Murillo Gómez, from the Literary Letter Leamos.
In the interview, the Valecaucana replied:
"Leo a lot, I think quite in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, definitely I think that the book that marked me as a child is "the beginning", it's a very deep book.
Currently I read "Crime and punishment", is a universal literature book that we all must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Niirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Blood Absorption".
One answer that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and the second by not specifically explaining how each of the books quoted have marked it.
But at the end of Melina's ceremony, he showed himself to feel calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise to pass what it has to pass.
And for all people, please read a little bit, "The beginning" is a big book."
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle burned her favouriteism.
A bogotan journalist pointed out that when he was the preferred, ovarian and candidate who was carrying all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy network, public vote for the best craft, and Queen Madre), "he woke up the cells of the other candidates, stressed the queen, and so did not shine in the stage."
And that was noted in his first presentation in the bathroom on the beach of Hilton and his two drawings in the coronation glass.
Although in both of the secure lights, it was noted that he lacked the strength and influence that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantis had demonstrated themselves.
Ariel Osoriio, journalist of the program "As at Home", of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "confirmed that the candidate who won the most prizes during the competition did not remain as queen".
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very wrong with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For one thing, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty showed that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Colombia Miss should look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, which are already involved in projects before entering the Competition," he explained.
It is also estimated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the back and the fibrosis that was recorded in her womb, but it is contradictory because the jury chose her as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the most healthy body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen's cook Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina had no better body, which had better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdominal, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, made her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, believes that the error of the Valecaucacan was the surgical interventions that took place.
"The surgeons are fine, but Valle is not supposed to do it.
His body was never his strength and he was buried here."
Because of this award, which for the first time delivered the National Contest of Beauty, after the fire in the bathroom, a cruel Vatican arose that was carried out last night, because it was said that this was the joy Raymundo gave to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Indeed or not, it is true that Melina has since begun a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international certifications for the designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her wandering through Cartagena, was mistaken for the crown.
So it was the work of the camel that identified Alfonso Cano's catacomb.
Cali's lophoscopist went through history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alphonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4th, a lofoscopist of Cali's CTI passed into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the greatest chief of the Farcs: "Alphonso Cano", through the chain of his digital needles.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the CTI section, that week he was playing the "advantage" tour to Eliazar González, a man in Puerto Tejada who was 21 years old working in the judicial research area.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Chocó municipalities, where he had to enter the forest for more than five days to reach the site where the corpses that were supposed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after performing the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the hair of the friction, that is, the palm of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against Alphonso Cano's alias to Eliazar, they warned him to wear a minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he went out to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that he was suspected that one of them was the man who led the world's oldest war, so they asked him to bring Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the corpse was found he did not recognize it because of his physical appearance, it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without beard, dressed as a champion in the area, without gloves and much more delicate.
But the eggs don't matter.
Along with a galtonian lupa, tinta, a transplanter and a lintern, Eliasazar compared the datillary impressions of cadavar with those of the card.
Your eye didn't miss him: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming him to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was the chief of the Farcs.
Searching for the Hole
For a dactiloscopist at the Sijén de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González in the press street by the operator against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactiloscopy is an exact science, without a margin of error, which can be key to the resolution of crimes.
In addition to the identification of corpses, lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the persons captured.
When they get caught, many criminals have false papers or don't have papers.
We take them into account and look for them in the database.
The investigator reported that, in a noise case, he had to remove a wall of a house, since at that point the thief had supported his hand to get a strong box full of joyas and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to remove a dating impression, but in that case we could get the hole from all hands and identify the offender, who had been involved in different speeds," he recalled.
The needles can also dissipate or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
A while ago they found a dead man, with bottles of silver around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, in fact, a hole in the matching bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that he has been the killer, it is located in the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactiloscopist explained that in the objects "the eggs are produced with chemical or physical reactions".
When they appear, a transplanter is used to lift them up.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not all is as shown in the CSI TV program.
So, not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches it turns yellow.
However, if it can be used, if the quota is carried out.
"Indignants" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the Zuccotti square to camp.
A large part listened to the departure order and moved to a nearby parish.
The integrations of the Occupa Wall Street movement this morning challenged New York's authorities to try to enter again, under the cover of a judicial order, at Manhattan's place where they were expelled from the madrugada and when they tried to hire another park from the Grand Manzana.
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access a court order that allowed the "indignants" to camp again in the area, while another part of the movement responded to the departure by occupying a park more north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will install somewhere else and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the drivers of the "Work Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "incarnations" to the departure of his camp personally condemned by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the place and allowed the protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "indignants" were engaged in the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which is a New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least one hour they were able to occupy the place, but then the police escorted and tried to arrest some of the exhibitors, although Brey could not confirm the actual number, while ensuring that Efé saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people who have been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been moved in a demonstration of support to the elements of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square - which is a recent private property - remains closed to the expectation of the celebration of a judicial view scheduled for this very morning in which the legality of the eviction of this madguda must be analysed.
Some of the delegates moved up there carried and distributed copies of that court order at these hours and even delivered them to the officers who kept the square, which caused "some small confrontations," declared Bray, who claimed that some officials had proposed attacks on the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from leaving the members of Occupa Wall Street or applying "laws published after they started the occupation or prohibiting the exhibitors from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they previously used".
The mayor of Bloomberg pointed out in front of the press that because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the opening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, who warned, however, that local laws would not allow them to reinstall with camp stores and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the departure of the Zuccotti square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were committed and which was decided because the protesters were "in violation of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it was becoming "in a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm others", because "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors had "for their quality of life".
"The departure of this madrugada was absurd and shows that in the Bloomberg fund it is more interested in preserving the financial interests of the US workers than it is," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "missing respect for freedom of expression".
The "Occupa Wall Street" officials also indicated that they were thinking of organizing "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community and trade union organizations, to commemorate the two months during the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television tour
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's at Russell Peters Christmas" next December
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant at "Home Improvement", co-founder at "Baywatch", known as "Playboy", the wife of rock music Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special feature of Canadian television.
The private CTV TV channel announced today that Anderson, along with the "croonner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" the next 1 December giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV distributed today images of the TV program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the Internet of a video pornographic home in which he appeared along with his wife, "Mötley Crée", Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Mary, holding in a piece of trash that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a Canadian comical of Indian origin who recently acted as a representative in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" race, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special CTV navigator has a Canadian singer Bublé, who was married in Buenos Aires in late March with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the U.S. Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan rebirth after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the drop spiral that started in March
Since last March the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalient by the earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that has plagued the country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo accounted for the material losses of $300,000 million, a strike that, despite the difficult world context, seems to have been achieved.
After three consecutive trimesters of fall, the date of the Gross Internal Product between July and September served to pass the page, definitively: the GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent at the annual rate.
The second trimester - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also suggests the highest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the response of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas assorted by seismo and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the decline of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first delay after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revolving Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan impulse that invites the crisis to be used to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use the shortages to grow from zero.
Japan has highlighted, above all, the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60 per cent of Japan's GDP.
This variable scaled 1%, driven by increased expenditure in vehicles, travel and activities.
The y-axis
Tokyo has been ordered to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese coin - has become one of the "refuge values" selected by investors who escape the debt crisis in the euro area and the U.S. forecasted turbulence, a privilege that weighs as a burden on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products become more expensive abroad, a serious return to a country whose economic fluctuation line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September at the yen's rate.
While the markets continue with their asylum to the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower its guard.
"You must be alert to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the State Secretary of Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had presented in September more recent signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that predicts the global economy's inflation points has highlighted that the main forces are being shaken.
Since it fell four tenths to the 100.4 points, against the 100.8th of August.
The euro area, including the euro area, was located below the average, which is at level 100, with eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Athenians to feed the doubts again
Papady says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment.
With broken peripheral risk premiums and the uncertainty installed in the parks, Greece continues to grow in the labyrinth leading to the rise of the great debt crisis in Europe.
The sense that the “consensual” of the new Greek Transitional Government is more taxed by the requirements of Brussels than by a genuine agreement of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new first Minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment might be short-lived to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the expected date, on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," Papadimo advised us to open a parliamentary debate tomorrow, which will end with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of staff and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not raise doubts about its position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have committed nothing more."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that should unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that he would not give a good view to any compromise paper on the implementation of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which was still shocked by the impact of the mandate of the referendum of Papadreu, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not block aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main German parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth tramo" of 8,000 million, although there is no final date either.
The Greek Madeja still has an arrow for the wheel.
Ms. Sofia: "It's instruments for progress and hope"
The Kingdom highlights Spain's "pre-position" position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-wide preposterous place in the role of Microfinances".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the plant in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "esence" pointed out to be a " instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in human being".
The Queen opened the World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid yesterday with the assurance that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations in the 2015 horizon, and, "very, particularly, in what aims to reduce the volume of people living with lower incomes to a daily dollar, which sets the "poverty threshold".
Spain "keep working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all the corners of the planet, and take this task with "responsibility", noted Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating in the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is based not only as a debate forum but also as a platform from which to push "two basic objectives".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it was hoped that at the end of 2015, 175 million poor families had access to these financial services and that hundreds of millions of such households would come from the poverty gap in which they are being raised.
The momentum in the concept of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the campaign launched years ago as a pioneer" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasised Doña Sofia as a "dedicated act of justice and recognition".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as an "adorable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the land her loan policy.
This experience followed him a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada, and "in all, I have been able to identify the continuing evolution," His Majesty explained, whose connection with this project was worth the qualification of the "family head" collected in Valladolid by the "fisher of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded its intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and seeking solutions to progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this sense, it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredit was "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than never" the governments of developed countries should work under the criteria of solidarity and not let it be a victim of the Snippets.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
On the other hand, the State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, commended "the success" for giving "trust" to people "excluding those who closed the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed those who were present to a city that "opens their infected doors to the solid spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal supply
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (CDU), on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
At first, the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was put forward in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy the soldiers who believe that the Government's policy is currently too little with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes were recorded against and ten abstentions.
The standing ovulation of several minutes won, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Eurofil Minister of Finance, reflects any possible doubt.
The key idea of Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a text: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe claims peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way to Europe."
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to allow for the strengthening of the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also take place in the election of the President of the European Commission for universal supply in order to "open his face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the winds will soon reach an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain shows hostility to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected the proposal by a majority to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank Directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Anxiety for calming the souls in the midst of her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, it has not tried to win its convention at the expense of the European "little" countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the proud Germans.
Although the movement on Europe is a part of the importance of "the French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Recalling that two centuries ago a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in the poor by disease
After subsidies, the UMP and the Government commit an offence against the poor by disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Burdeos on Tuesday, 15 November to visit a responsible box of family subsidies and to give a speech on the topic, which has been running since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
In addition, to accompany such offensive, which is part of the willingness to save in a strict manner, but still remembers an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority want to focus on the poor by disease.
Firstly, in order to apply budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of unemployment on the private sector before it is able to take the floor.
Finally, unless a specific business agreement exists, a sick worker would lose four days of salary, i.e. at least 15 per cent of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise an oil of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on employees a day of unemployment without wages in the case of low wages (to date, they do not have unemployment, against the three days that are applied in the private sector).
As these issues are discussed, the majority again put on the table also the subject of fraud, this time directed towards the abuses of the labour force.
"The controls will be significantly increased and, in addition, if someone is found committing a fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned speaking in the RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of the fraud in the labour market.
In fact, there has been a constant follow-up to this issue since 2002 and a number of violent policies have been launched that have usually resulted.
The French are no longer sick in the rest of Europe.
Let us take note, firstly, of the national figures.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), in 2006, more than EUR 237 million were allocated to low-employment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, low-income subsidies represented 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008, reaching EUR 11.300 million.
Of this sum, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, whereas 54 per cent is related to diseases, which amounts to EUR 6,200 million.
Therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting group.
One medium, which certainly conceals deviations: another survey published in 2007 by Monster.com, showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day off by disease.
Another study, in this case of the Disease Insurance, indicated that in 2010 37 per cent of the sick population had a duration of less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between 1 and 3 months, and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more attractive than in other areas to bear diseases.
A long-term study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall unemployment rate (both for health and other reasons) increased between 10 per cent and 11 per cent in France, compared to 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the poor by disease is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
The fraud has a very limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has resulted in the control of disease-related diseases for more than 45 days in a systematic manner.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM verified, in a 13 per cent of 285,000 conducted, that short-term lows were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37.050 cases.
In the case of the 45-day lows, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "adequately adjusted or unjustifiable; a figure that, having a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132.000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjusted" cases are achieved among several million workers who contracted a disease.
No doubt, a significant figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP representative Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax income of between EUR 9000 and EUR 15 billion per year, that is, more than the total cost of lower subsidies and, of course, significantly more than the fraud in this last area.
Papademos: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos told Parliament on Monday 14 November; he also added that the hundred days that have been granted to his Government of the Union would not suffice to achieve that goal.
"To make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public talk during the opening of the debate on the vote on confidence in Parliament on Wednesdays.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Area Summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's stay in the euro area has been added.
As a result, Papadémos has foreseen that the country's public deficit will be reduced to "about 9 per cent" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right to refuse new Austrian measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right-wing group, expressed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but he warned that his party would not compromise with additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his "New Democracy" party.
He noted that he was in agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of EUR 8,000 million needed without a written guarantee of support for all parties to the proposed measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be sufficient and that it would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A Committee of Experts states that ethanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live by refusing to die, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In relation to palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperate to ensure better palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by rejecting death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make provisions for this effect.
It is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts from various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends to the Government that the Criminal Code be amended in such a way as to allow the assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is raised and has been judged competent to take the decision.
To begin with, experts mention a recent survey of the United Nations Economist that compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is occupied by the tenth place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid of dealing with the subject of death".
With or without medication, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6 per cent of them have died in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is Quebec, where 86 per cent of the deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not match the position of the Federal Government, which had already stated that he did not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they have not been considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of their application, namely the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with non-compliant persons or that they have not granted their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, the rapporteur, stated yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there was more than observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although clearly illegal."
"In Canada the assisted suicide is practiced, although clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, in favor of euthanasia
We recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people whose death is near to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that the fact of legislating euthanasia will not make it clear that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to persons who have been involved in the murder, 41 per cent of the respondents felt that there should be no process against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health assistance to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
Furthermore, among its recommendations it is suggested that the Criminal Code indicates that withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his or her life without fear of facing a complaint.
In relation to palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperate to ensure better palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to the palliative or terminal session, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has qualified as "extreme" the position of experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminal patients.
"This lets the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years of age can ask for help to kill himself," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now, add that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
The health expert Margaret Somerville also expressed his "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, puts in place the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus charges a "complete"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bachar El Asad's supporters appeared yesterday at the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Bachar El Asad Syria was intensified which, with Russia's support, resisted and complained that there was a "complete" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, close to Syria, have been demonstrated in favour of the withdrawal of power by President Asad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Asad to "give up power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime are already missing.
"If Bachar is really concerned about his country, he should leave, in addition to creating the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
On the other hand, the chief of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts that have been made by Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have been a failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, adding to Syria, a neighbouring country with regard to which Turkey is taking a more difficult position.
On the other hand, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the fact that "the agreement against Asad and the actions of the regime" has been seriously strengthened.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the League of Arab States and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking a more difficult tone" with regard to the repression in Syria, notes Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Department of State.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians have already lost their lives and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the Dera region, in southern Syria, as the Syrian human rights Observatory (SHR) has announced.
Other two civilians have fallen "in the face of bombings and shootings with heavy amplifiers in Jobar" in the city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press round, Syrian Foreign Affairs Minister Walid Al Mualem considers for his part that the country "steps towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has responded firmly to the Arab League's decision to suspend its duties, which, in its opinion, constitutes a "hazardous step".
Syria "will not fail," he added, ensuring that "the plot against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a " civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, in his view, is based on "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to mark the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities in the hands of opposition and the release of detainees.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, has judged yesterday as "inaccurate" the Arab League's decision, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, although not expressing its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Mounting takes time for the markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to train their team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" for recovery of the lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday, and today he met with the trade unions and the patronage.
It should form a relatively restricted office, composed of external technologies to Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a wide programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
On the other hand, the President of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, has stated that he expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament for a vote of confidence before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list of ministers, no doubt a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the bourgeois markets and the obligators yesterday, asking for time.
In the "democratic, there are certain times" to form a Government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that it is "sure that markets will have patience and understand".
Its appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then the concern was aroused, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team primarily formed by technocrats, even if he has emphasized that he would like to include "politics".
The new Government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislation, considering.
According to the President of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive Parliament's confidence vote before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he is in charge, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the aim that Italy "recovers its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that "including a new government, it will not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has requested the adoption of new restrictive measures.
The Italian "head of heads" Emma Markagglia, who will see the matter, also insisted on the need to push the economy, "because a country that does not grow cannot respect the requirements on deficit".
Monti, famous for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), proposes a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berluscononomy"; the "profesor" symbolizes "the challenge of the series" and "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the length of your team.
President Napolitan wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put some 200 million euros in State obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to a U.S. NGOs specializing in the nuclear risk on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that United Nations agency.
The IAEA expressed its "great concern" last week by a "probably military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on AIAA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and had participated in the production of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodimantes" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have brought him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
It is then believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its final report, the IAEA stated that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique but also, according to a Member State to the Agency, worked during most of its course in the nuclear programme of its country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, during the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to the statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has been from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. increased by 49 per cent, compared with a rise of 13 per cent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 per cent in crimes against Jews and a overall increase of 14 per cent in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47,3 per cent are due to racial differences and 20 per cent to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is alarming that these crimes and crimes have again increased," the Human Rights First Human Rights Defence Organization highlighted, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First spends a lot of time pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds an organization’s official, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and must strive to end such abuses," he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
"Violence crime" in the U.S. Federal Law was inherited from the time of civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site changed the moon's presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people who follow, causing their service to appear a little more than Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to continue more legally and directly the activity of other "Twittos", i.e., those on the Internet whose messages ("tweets") continue on the Internet or they continue on you.
This lets you know if you follow messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you prefer some message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network Monday, according to the AFP's Twitter portal, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive feature, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) doing the pleasure of the beginnings, opens a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of large public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have discussed the "tweets" hit with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much on Facebook," writes @jmb123.
"The function Activity will help me to follow some elements of my Twitter stream better," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Democratic Coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budget rule of gold to reduce public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the very Social Democrat Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6 per cent, a very higher figure than the maximum of 60 per cent fixed by the Maastricht Treaty but clearly lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency is reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay $3,000 million more in interest every year," said the Vicecanciller democraticist of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindeleger.
Austria responded to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of the past 26 October: in it, Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt that type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should be reduced annually by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (PIB) and, from 2017 onwards, the federal state's structural deficit should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP per year, while regional countries, as well as communities, should provide balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60 per cent criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A Strong Yen
Node threats with a new intervention in the exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the mark of the change if the Yen continued to increase.
"We will enter, as we did last time, if we check that there is excessive flying" in the type of change of yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yin rose to a level close to the greatest historical developments that the Japanese authorities had taken up on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massive coins per dollar to lower the value of the Japanese dividend, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yin has been constantly retiring since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" in these moments of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar to be reimbursed on Tuesday at least 77 and the euro has fallen under the 105-year symbolic bar, reaching levels close to those who have caused the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was costing around 120 years and the euro was over 160 years old.
This explosion of the Japanese dividend damages the exports of the archipelago, as it covers Made products in Japan and reduces the value of foreign revenues from Japanese companies when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting for reconstruction" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which destroyed the region of Tohoku (Northest), highlighted Noda, who fears that the imprisonment of the Yen cut off the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (a 1.5 per cent relative to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
The Minister for Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy Council on Tuesday, which takes all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Director of the Institute, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", showing that more monetary flexibility should not be expected.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the Emission Institute increased its sales to EUR 47,000 million (EUR 47,000 million), bringing to EUR 55 billion (EUR 519 billion) the threshold of the funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities in order to avoid the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the types grow, the bags fold
The risk of damage to the debt crisis continues to affect European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European bags fall a little further in the negative area on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hours, CAC 40 loses 1.4% and is located at 3.064 points.
The Dax lost a 0.4% in Frankfurt and a 0.1% in London.
"In view of the new tensions with regard to the performance of the most affected euro area loans, the world's bulsatile markets continue to be part of their recent gains."
"Inverters, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contamination," says Terry Pratt, institutional director at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Bolsa has closed with a drop of 0.7%, renewing market stakeholders' concerns about Europe's ability to bear the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has the firm view in Europe and the exchanges will continue to be made in a line of reduced variations, so that investors will not have proof that the situation has been stabilized," considers Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The recovery of concerns over the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline tomorrow.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Within 10 hours, the European currency was $1,3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the authors, it has lost value after the chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, who met on Monday at Congress, adopted a motion which, in particular, envisaged the option that a country in difficulty would leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types exceed 6% growth
The types of credit from Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian obligations at 10 years reached 6.85 per cent, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered a 6.2 per cent.
These tensions with regard to the types of interests of the countries of the south, even in France, continue to feed the fears of the stakeholders.
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked for time for markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of becoming assimilation with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference between the "spread" obligations for 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new maximum historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From the statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the projected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has reviewed the figure below the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (PIB) instead of a suspension.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent in the same period.
The first forecasts for the whole euro area are foreseen at 11 hours after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than the doctrines
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influences the acquisition power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the location of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the whole of the economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity before 2050, unless it is devoted to a large part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a growing lack of fossil resources to continue producing electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case either of Belgium, who submits to the need to find a source of power to replace it, or Switzerland, which aims only to build centres of the last generation.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, by citing some examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, refurbishing the construction of a interrupted centre after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is presented on occasions such as, for example, the reality goes against such a speech.
Berlin's election will entail an increase in electricity prices, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular in Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and carbon centres.
Within a few months, harmful effects will be reported.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's field in the ecological sector, with 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major carbon and gas users due to the intermittent wind; therefore, its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constant nature of our energy policy, our neighbors have an electricity factor of 40% higher than the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheaper electricity.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would entail a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic in the wonderful declarations on the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
It is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, they do not manifest a principle of opposition to this type of energy, according to the surveys.
We remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 440,000 indirect jobs.
Widely directed towards export, it covers a range of specialized pymes in the international markets and which can create jobs that can not be delocated.
If France decided to give up nuclear energy, it would impose a large part of those SMEs and the loss of EUR 6,000 million per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electricist would charge an EPR designed to operate for six years, when the crash of his manufacturer is foreseen?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be acknowledged that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as well as there is no diabolic source.
Development by Areva of low CO2 solutions, nuclear and renewables, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the maximum level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control both on existing centres and on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognised professionality, are also obsessed with safety.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, on Three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; it did not produce consequences for people or for the environment.
In Chernobil, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and some unforgivable human faults.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this incident, as did the two others before.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities and the French and German operators, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While studying it all the electric players who want to build a center, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the Areva and EDF competitors, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and shared manoeuvres dominate a very important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a load or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the digital policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "State of Human Rights".
More recently, it is the administrative appeal of foreign students that has jumped to the titlers, with the Minister of Interior (see the May 23 release periodical) saying that France "does not need foreign talent, workers or maids".
However, it is rarely analysed from the economic point of view.
The question is that, on this issue, there is enough consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that "950,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million migrant workers," while on the left, the tone set it by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot be responsible for all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish sources.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which immigrants act.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to the inclusion of banals, indicating that the development of codification will allow for the solution to "the problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be selectively profitable, but economically it goes very far.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exclusive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and affects employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular the low-qualified, with pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are better complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly engaged in non-employment professions.
Low-qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff requirements.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anaesthetics, complementaryness between national and immigrant peoples has a positive impact on the salaries and employment of the national population.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1 per cent of the migration flows would result in a rise in real wages in the long term between 0.6 and 0.9 per cent.
And, bearing in mind that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of the Nobel Prizes of Naturalized States and Companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute about 1 per cent of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany a 30-year-old immigrant will make a net (lower) contribution of EUR 150,000 to public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
Those words, which encouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, only the lack of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to agree with this because, although invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, during the 20th century, the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, Holocaust, Google, but also in France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the Colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that, in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and as direct as possible.
We know from Napoleon "the Little One" that was about something to think about.
The universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough for itself and can even be converted into a "pressure instrument", as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Light, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to turn into a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek reference had, in this regard, a twofold revealing effect: it showed the need for a strong return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its incomprehensibility, of its incomprehensibility.
You need to think about this ambivalent to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines ahead of the democratic battle have now been moved and that, in many cases, the Republican soldiers are no longer making good progress.
We will not fail to win if we require a succession of national references, organized according to the needs and in a way that is not in order.
A signature in white to the absolute European monarchy or to the vacuum of the nationalist eagle: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to get out of impact, but a common exercise, full of law, peace and continuity, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that falls under the orders of the markets and the qualifying agencies, who suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is suffering from international humiliation.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
Most urgent is that popular sovereignty recover the team of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the burden of their debt, release from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After a long fight against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world is currently asking for a European economic governance.
That's right.
But to think about it without more political and democratic integration, and without living as such by citizens, would be a new thing and bring us to a new point of death.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution motivated by interest would not be sufficient.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from the economic perspective.
Only by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, we make Europeans.
The cards with "no contact" chips are generalised
The world Chip Card World Hall begins Tuesday in Villapinte, near Paris, with an optimistic environment.
In fact, 2011 should end with an increase of 11 per cent in world sales of cards with microprocessors (banks, calls with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart's estimates.
The most powerful segment is the technology without contact, which allows you to subscribe to common transport or purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
It should continue to increase in 2012 (over 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which spends a lot of time on the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining land in the payment sector without contact.
About 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: they are using 400,000 Visa cards without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million cards this year Pass MasterCard without contact.
In order to measure the upper run, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French institutions that have committed themselves to systematically disseminate in the future, among their clients, banking cards that have no contact with the system," announced Gérard Nébouy, director-general of Visa Europe France.
Banks proved the payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for performing transactions.
"If they're cutting."
"But in order to experience a real increase in the coming year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the front.
The Agricultural Credit Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June next.
The iPhones will be equipped with about 200 customers and collaborators with a fund that allows the payment to be paid without contact.
The ECB has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marsella.
And the General Society has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact via their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is rising
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, who had been suspected for some time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Argel already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that they are cooperating," he explained, without adding more details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation on the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January would have resumed the marches.
Founded at a Niamey restaurant by people related to Akmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the scope of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
He's a terrorist.
The survey of calls carried out indicates several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who has been staying in Maiduguri for a long time, a city in northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposed to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is a progress, but we must no doubt expect to have more formal evidence before discussing operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been more and more evident in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram or in its operational ways, which now involve the use of more complex and explosive devices than used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time considering the group as a small-scale lighting community.
A Speedy Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a méquita, a school and the Imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in fact, " Western education is a sin"), induces the establishment of an Islamic empress in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is living a quick success.
It is political and requires strict respect for the Sharia, while its soldiers are engaged in the fight against the corrupt central government.
These last are directed primarily to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militias were particularly active and the attacks against the commissioners were multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, generalized.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, received death in prison.
Since then, the sect radicalises and abandons its Northern Hemispheres.
The Navidites' passage requires an alert that causes 80 deaths in Jos and, later, another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the police security headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of this kind.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist lake in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, concerns all security experts.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Cebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat at the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all information".
The World According to Republican candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, with Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are simply lacking knowledge.
An American weakened by the crisis, can it manage a complex world with simple ideas or, even, simple?
By listening to the Republican candidates for the presidentials, the electors might think so.
Since a few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have made more constructive statements and attacks on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The arms, often unfounded, are extended over China, Iran, to help Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race to the "Grand Old Party" designation, has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and declare them "by manipulating their division", a key issue in a America that is expected by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
As if that meant the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, is almost blind to an attitude that "fabuls" emotions.
He has requested a strong, but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the probes, remains unheard of.
To Reagan style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions do not stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is reelected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfil its obligations in relation to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows a shameless ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he tried to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "has been trying to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had military atoms since 1964.
The Governor holds Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is, on his part, willing to deploy the US military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The resort to torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, also preconceived Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are significant with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The current President's opponents reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an affidavit and that he had to cover up the pistone in combating terrorism.
They insist, for good reason, on the failure of their engineering dialogue with Iran, on the premature exit of Iraq's "boys" and on their tertiversizations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks aren't easy for them.
The population is judged in a more positive way by Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, there has been a lack of confidence in military intervention that generates a fall.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild economically America to restore its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The North Stream, new Russian gas entrance door in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea, has already been in service.
Gas must be provided to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a big pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated in the birthplaces of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the opening of the North Stream, the new gasduct that directly communicates, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have worked together on the wheel that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, each year it will reach 27.5 million cubic metres of additional Russian gas to Western Europe through a first 1,224 km tube that communicates the region of St. Petersburg with the Country of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded by the end of 2012 that will allow a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, i.e. sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, it is already about the possibility of building a third pipe by the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion of this enormous work presents the area of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Unfortunately, these two countries lose some of their power: it will be more difficult for them to influence Russia by putting them in danger of closing access to the markets in Western Europe.
In the light of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new fraternal-Soviet-Soviet pact" with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically delicate.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has generated a gap between the Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to draw on its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new arthropod that we are organically united," François Fillon confirmed during the opening of the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the large gas sector contracts are as political as economic as possible.
All of this explains the broad smiles in the faces of the Gazprom directives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline also implies technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement steel to protect it from the waves of the boats.
It is supported in the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid mines coming from World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, by caution," notes Jens Müller, a carrier of the North Stream society.
It was also necessary to eliminate the protection measures for the farm and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was set up in the waters of Sweden, but the project's managers rejected the fact that the Soviets were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be established permanently in the sea at its borders.
"In case of averaging, we will interrupt the gas step in less than a minute," needs Jens Müller.
In the case of escape, gas shall therefore be released to the atmosphere.
However, constructioners consider it unlikely that a flight will be produced, since it has been envisaged that one flight will have a flight every 100,000 years, according to the estimates.
The control of the status of the gas duty shall be ensured by a submarine robot drawn by a vessel carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device that is traveling through the internal gas duty.
With the form of a clean, it enters the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of a meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three metres per second, provide accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for five years without any type of repair.
Gas circulation is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it's 200 bars and, at the end of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined their forces to carry out this project.
The lead company is Gazprom, which has 51 per cent of the participation.
It joined the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint company called Nord Stream, responsible for building and exploiting the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zuug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Later, Gazprom rented to that company, within a period of twenty-five years renewable, the total capacity of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for its total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been completed by 30 per cent with the contribution of shareholders and by 70 per cent through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7,400 million for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom takes the risk of spending alone.
The ballistic Gasodut emerges in Lubmin, on an arenosed pines-planted coast.
Some valves, with 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas to arrive before it is transferred to the German gases.
Since last March, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
Total capacity will be three million per hour and six million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand-new book.
Created about half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to bring people back the taste for writing.
It's got an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine book is easily recognized, with its black rectangles, its rubber, its white-colored leaves, as ageed by time.
However, the books of Moleskine with the current aspect were born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a book of design notes, but different.
Maria Sebregondi, therefore the company's consultant, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin (top) which refers to a barnized cotton used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of book was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the Watchers until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode.
And it worked.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The first year's confidential production, in which only 3,000 were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian frontiers and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open spirit and cults.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginning, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its rooms in libraries, from Fnac to the small shops in the city centre, and it is wise to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own workshop.
In August, he also launched a theatre with woodcuts, due to the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has learned to diversify its products: pockets, agendas, boligraphs, computer bases... The brand covers a wide range of media.
A success that causes envy: in October 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, in the current Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for employment.
The XV Week for the use of disabled people starts today.
Despite a public policy that has been implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled persons doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disappointment?
"No," says Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the use of disabled persons.
"The progress achieved five years ago is considerable.
"At that time the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there's still a lot to do."
It should be noted that disabled persons continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They usually have a higher age: 37% is over 50 years of age (about 17% of the average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% has not completed the education and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, the long-term wall is very extensive among them: 53 per cent for disabled persons, compared to 38 per cent of the average.
In other words, there are many issues that are particularly difficult to return to the working world and that "constitutually constitute the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mental attitude progresses, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneurship for the City indicated that the respondents had "a level of knowledge on low disability", with "excessive representation of people in the street, physical or intellectual deficits".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hireing 6% of disabled workers, the objective of which was laid down in a Act of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures from 2008, a ratio of 2.6 per cent is reached.
"We now reach around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for withdrawing the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The evidence: the number of establishment "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts paid, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, has generated a great pressure on businesses," Pierre Blanc explains.
"But this improvement also reflects true consciousness, especially among the great groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of the companies with between 20 and 49 employees have employees who are disabled in their schedule, compared to 82 per cent of the companies between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
To meet the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party generates.
We will not dare to say that there was a knowledge among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting together, on the street of the Auditorium of the City of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the gesture of withdrawal from its front against Turkey, the Belgian elector has no more than praise for him.
"I'll be very happy for Eden, for its progress and because it's Belgian."
"I want to move forward," answers Lille's front.
As to the contrast between their presentations in your team and the selection, "is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year old, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to "brillar".
Don't forget the pleasure.
He has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven, as well as during the 1998 and 2000 victory campaigns.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
This will undoubtedly strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because it will face " the Mathieu (Debuchy), Johann (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " remember.
"We just met a little ago.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
In simple terms, Leekens has made his part a reference to "hungle".
"Orgulu" to argue "a gala party."
"Orgullo" also for testing, as "foreign", which France "was to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc has done a wonderful job," said excitedly.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technique would be pleased to be able to share a plane with the Blues towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he said.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, they're ambitious.
"You can see it in the next games." Including the game against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Portugal of Paul Bento faces a great optimism at the turn of the turn against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the past, they lacked realism on both teams.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paul Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt that the election, which has been taking place since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the ageing party (0-0), the Friday in the fire of Zenica, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but I couldn't mark the precious goal that would have given him peace.
"It's a good result, but it once took a risk, because we haven't marked out."
But at home, at the bright stage of the Lisbon Light, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before a public that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it turns out that the party is "very equal", said an optimistic but bright Bento.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We continue to have a 50% chance to participate in the Eurocopa 2012," however, said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The winter meal in Bosnia requires the Portuguese to mark and win.
The bosses could have an impact on them, although they also need to be marked.
"It's a good result, but it once took a risk, because we didn't notice out of the house," Bento laments.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are going with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "do not let them think".
A good idea, always, this time, be realistic.
