Here's your medicine.
Here's what's on the floor.
I'm sick of it.

Here's the new speaker in the class.
Here's my stepfather's table.
Here's the one who saw it.

This is why the card is here.
Here's what's going on.
Here's your help.
That's what you're doing.

Here's a new big one.
Here's a new big one.
Here's a new big one.
There's a new dad.

This is where you can live forever.
There's a bullet in the throat.
There's a bullet in the throat.
Here we go.
There's a point.
There's a point.
This is my mother's card.

Here she is.
There's a lot to think about.
Here's the ponie.

There's a guy down there.
Displays from top to bottom.
I'm not sure you're interested in anything.
In the south!
John is now an angel.
The breath of the breath, please.
That's what he's trying to do.
That's the guy who was in the van.
He's an old man who's sleeping.
It's the cat he's in the bottom of the hole.
I'm sorry.
He has put you in help.
And he came to a village.
And that's your dog's drug.
He's a drug addict.
That's what he wants us to do.
He's the one who cares about you.
That's what he wants.
He's going to leave me alone.
She's a good girl.
She is a very old woman.
That's what she looks like.
That's what you're looking for.
That's what she looks like.
He's got a big cat.
And that's what happened.
That's a good idea.
And that's Maria's age.
He said he was going to die.
I'm afraid I'm going into it.
He's my brother.
That's a new one.
And he's singing the piano.
And that Paul and Mary are mother.
And there's a lot of money in there.
And that's what you're going to do.
He's listening to you.
He's got a problem and he's got something to do with it.
Her husband, Tom, was a close friend of Mary.
And that's three of them.
There's three of them and Tom.
That's the three of you.
And that was the situation in the history.
That's where we're sitting at the top of the table.
That's not funny about music.
He is not interested in the practice.
He is the same as everyone else.

You're already running.
Now you're studying.
He's the one who killed you.
He is the one who kills a person who hates blood.
I'm afraid I'm sick of it.
And he's going to hit it.
You're a kind of guy.
And you're German.
And you're in school.
He's in school.
That's why we're not allowed to do this.
That's what he doesn't care about.
That's not true.
He's not taking it.
That's not true.
That's why we kill a man.
That's why we don't kill a convention.
That's what we're doing.
That's what we're working on.
That's not a tiberth.
That's not true.
That's not a waste of time.
He's a short man.
He is the only one who cares about them.
He's the only one who's gone.
He is the only one who kills women.
It's a shame you killed him.
There's a lesson to be learned.
He's an asshole.
He's still looking after them.
He's never killed.
He's a very old man.
He's the only one who ever showed it.
He's always reading the book.
He's a strange son of a bitch.
He's a slow guy.
