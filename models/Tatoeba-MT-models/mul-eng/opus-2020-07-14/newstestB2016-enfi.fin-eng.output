Ronaldo again hurjana - a repi painting of the Messiah
Cristian Ronaldo took five medals in Spain for a week and continued to perform at the Mesera.
The bond between Lionel Messin and Christian Ronaldo from the Mestars to the Mestrians became at least a temporary success.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the bottom of all the age-old landscapes, when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk on the network two pieces of criminal activity and one game room.
Ronaldo was in his 80s, before he joined him in a settlement in Barcelona Messil with 77 pieces.
Real won the prize 4-0.
Juventus has since been computered in the Italian football game in Series A, but it started with a strong 2-1-year-old from Manchester City.
The battalion took ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack broke down the serotype of Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, in the weekend of the election, came to the village for the last ten minutes.
In the Netherlands, the United States also experienced severe PSV Endhovena suffering from 1-2 seizures.
When ManU's 20-year-old vice-president Luke Shaw's visit, he's always just waiting.
The PSV's dangerous movement of Hector Moren became so dangerous that the attack against the ManU package was so bad that Shaw would probably be in the wrong place.
Shaw skere at Eindhoven's home at ten minutes before the medical staff took him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay will take you to a 41-minute drive, but ManU's joy lasts only a few minutes.

The opposition party demanded an immediate difference - the president was speaking in the wrong way
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe spoke the same language he had been holding months ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has spoken again in the country's parliament in the same speech that he had at the end of the last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe evidently did not speak the same language.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full power.
The MDC’s main party called for Mugabe to be separated from its task because this is too old to be managed.
The assistants of Mugaben were quick to say that the defeat had occurred only in Mugabe's presence and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugaben's speech was discussed earlier and now China's impact on the economy of the country.
Germany and Austria wish to attend a comprehensive conference on refugee crises
Germany and Austria have introduced the summit of EU leaders for the first week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council for Summits, assessed the request.
According to the German Association, the Heads of State, Angela Merkel, should discuss cooperation with non-member countries and how they will be able to obtain more effective registration.
The negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers are part of the internal ministerial meeting, according to Merkel.
The professor will give his girlfriend a shot in the emergency.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University called in the emergency call a few senior police officers called at his home and told his girlfriend that she was his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their love of their dog was in place and alive and probably in fear. The professor said that the contact information of a woman’s family would be on the woman’s phone.
Within the house, the police found a message written to Amy Prentiss on the body and white paper: "I'm very sorry and I hope I can undo my actions. I love Amya, and he is the only woman who ever loved me," in a letter signed by Lambi, including by the authorities.
There was no sign in the court that Lamb, who taught two web courses at Delta State University in Mississippin Cleveland, had already travelled 500 kilometers to the school head camp. The police found in his camp a dead man named Professor Ethan Schmidt, who was believed to be a bomb.
Delta State University police officer Lynn Buford claimed that the university official received information on the bombing at 10.18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb called the jury a call some time after this.
One more death sentence was possible on the day that Lamb himself was killed when the police tried to kill him.
The next day, the students and the teaching staff stopped behind the doors closed, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motives.
The researchers discovered details in both places, and the experiences of Lambine told of a man. The researchers were given a picture of a generous year, but it was not a problem teacher.
The students always said they were waiting for the professor's feelings.
According to the police of Gautier, the Prentissian death camp, professors had no prior violence or crime.
Schmidt was mentioned in Lambine's writing in a book that he had given recognition to "all people", with whom he was able to enjoy academic life.
Both worked on community data and history, with 17 students attending the courses of both men.
However, references to the problem arose.
Lambia, a late student named Brandon Beavers, said that Professor was moved by the excitement and excitement, "as if he had anything to do with it."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb had told him of his stress at the end of 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously given Delta State University a disease epidemic because of some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the claim that Lamb had done hard work for him was not automatically returned to him as an assistant professor.
Dr. William LaForge told the university that there was no known dispute between Lambine and Schmidt, but he realized that Lambia was clearly in trouble.
The Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
The police from the camp found out what Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police targeted Lambine, he had himself been arrested by a 38-calypse gunman at the back of the room in Mississippi Greenville, about a mile away from his parents' home, told Mathel Johnson, a dying researcher in the Washington area.
The Lamb's car was still on the ground.
The police didn't immediately understand why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson told him he believed that a man knew the room.
He put his youth in the area.
Lamb started working as a teacher at a university with 3,500 students . There were 12,000 inhabitants in the city in 2009 .
He got a doctor's degree in growth data in winter.
One of Lambine's longest-time friends described this as smart, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston reported his habit through his friends Lambi when he was 15 and Lamb at the age of 20.
He was still a friend of mine, and Lamb had to be interested in the older guy who had been trying to teach Irish culture for years.
"Lamb was then a bit of a heart attacker.
All the girls were on her bed," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson City, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time ago.
In the emergency call, Lamb told his wife that he had killed his wife, but no document says they have been cursed.
A couple of dogs were named Lightning, and they lived in the gymnasium in the small town of Gautier.
According to the police, the dog was okay.
The Prentissian, former husband Shawn O'Steen, told his difference with the Prentiss 15 years ago. The Parisian society had remained a friend, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was very upset," O'Steen said to his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were the best friends."
O'Steen didn't meet Lambi, but she heard from Abigail that Lamb had music and called blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail appeared on both summer days three years ago.
Later, they called each other together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter will sing and present her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a barium and a part-time wind coordinator, regardless of the demands of The Julep Room at Gautier's restaurant, told him on September 5th when Lamb had called the newspaper and the charity to the rare public.
There was nothing to say that something would have been wrong.
"Saffrey Paris," said Shaffer.
"We were together.
They both had a good breakfast."
"Surmans, Professor Schmidt, led the first year's seminar and had specialized in the history of the Indian and the transition," English Professor Don Allan Mitchell told.
She was married, and she had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of his own brotherhood and university.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, 900 people met in the monumental procession. Among them were the teaching staff, other staff, students, and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in another occasion when the university cook presented the chapters "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The teaching goes on in the middle of the week.
"We're trying to get the students back," said LaForge.
"The crisis is over.
This is a day to improve."
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported on Mississippi Cleveland.
Contributors: Associated Press Providers Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippin Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The story is correct, because the police now tell us that Lamb called the emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also clarified that even though Lamb referred to Prentiss' wife in the emergency, their marriage is not evidence.
Toys R Us is going to hire fewer workers.
The Toys R Us company does not intend to hire as many workers as in the last year. However, the resales of toys and children products are available to modern workers and workers to additional jobs.
The company is planning to hire 40,000 people to sales and distribution centres in various countries. In 2014 it paid 45,000 workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The applicants' questionnaires will be launched this month, and new workers will begin in November and June.
Although the harvest is still months, the season in the trade sector is approaching a good pace, and companies are preparing to pay temporary jobs for sales and the delivery of goods and supplies.
Michael J. Fox looks at his "treffet" with Princess Diana
Back in the future, Michael J. Foxin had an important moment for the U.S.
On the first night, there was also a personal interest.
"We sat in the theater and waited for royal arrivals. I noticed that my neighbor was an empty place. To me, my white sister Diana is coming to my neighbor," Fox said, coming back in Time document trailer.
"When the film began, I realized that the situation had been severely reminded of the encounters with Princess Wallace."
Back in Time document is related to future photos, and the documents also refer to Foxin as Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the leader of Robert Zemecki and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back in the future, the picture was taken 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time series for me," said Spielberg.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be displayed in selected video fields from October.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, commented on Russia's strengthened military activities and said that the five-year conflict would not be a military solution and that weapons would only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General once again urged all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join their forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
In a press conference held last Wednesday, the Ban announced its intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, and to discuss the situation in Syria.
Ban regretted that the deterioration of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers has caused a situation that cannot be resolved.
The Bank invited five permanent Member States to demonstrate similar solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis, with which the Iran nuclear agreement was reached.
8th reading of support: Is Donald Trump real?
Trumpia's been trying to be an idiot.
He's also been arrested.
Some predict Trump's fall.
In the Republican borders, the result has been tried (in other words) by all means to catch the drop point under Trump.
Ten of the nine national national gallup shows Donald Trump, two-digit support lines, and the part is already seriously based on what it actually tells about the possibilities for proposals for the construction module.
The choices are really the opposite of the beginning.
Nothing has yet been said that Trump is elected as a representative of the Republicans.
The respondents recall that Rick Perry, who was present in the 2011 Galleburg Camp, was able to give a position to Herman Cain. At last, he did not win an offer in any of the states.
It would have been a lot of trouble in the general election.
External groups such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth have taken note of Trumpin's strong position and began to dig for his escape.
The following minor Gallupitis data show that the injection molluscs cannot be applied to the ovarian traction:
There's been a full order in Trump's suffering.
Just before Trump announced his proposal in the middle of June, only two of the ten republican republicans, according to the University of Monmouth, had a positive picture.
By mid-June, 40 percent had been positive.
The corresponding share at the beginning of August was 52 per cent.
Now, in six months of ten Republicans, Donald Trump is a welcome guest.
About three out of ten are forbidden.
These lists shall also be held in the Member States in which the elections are first organized.
In the last week, 60 per cent of the Republicans in Quinnipac-Gallup was a welcome view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be satisfied with the Trump proposal.
During the last week of CNN and ORC, 67% of the Republican population was found to be very satisfied or satisfied with the possibility of selecting Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the ten would be very unhappy with the Trump's proposal.
Ben Carson will receive nearly one innocuous response than Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's proposal and 40% with Trump's proposal).
Who's the next proposed proposal?
The third is Marco Rubio, which is 21%.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican citizens would be either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were to be called a candidate for the party.
Most Republican people do not consider the Trump temperature to be a problem.
Donald Trumpia has been criticised widely by the opinion of the representatives of the Republicans. 52 per cent of the country's supporters hold the properties of the construction aid in agreement with the Presidents.
The same is true of Iowa, where the district meeting is organized first: 52 per cent of the Republicans, according to Quinnipiac-Gallup, maintains the personal characteristics of Trump's defence forces in agreement with the superior authorities.
However, according to the ABC and Post-Gallup, 44% considered that Trump was not able to function effectively, and six out of ten considered that the temperature of Trump was inadequate in the White House.
The Republicans are beginning to think.
They're starting to deal with Trump.
When the Republicans are informed, who is most likely to be elected as a candidate, four tenths believe in the possibilities of Trump, according to the CNN and ORC.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money to the bank for Jeb Bush.
Totality: The Republicans have not previously had a highly reliable crystal ball in their use.
At this stage of the last four of the last ten republican elections, Rick Perry was probably a candidate, and only 28 per cent of Mitt Romney.
Most people seem to think that Trump's campaign is an insurance policy.
Although the Republicans would also support the other bidders, Trump hides almost all other bidders.
Some experts believe that the distributed team will likely benefit from the use of Trump when its opponents share various sponsors.
The opinion of the Monmouth University in early September revealed that Trupin and almost anyone else in the two-dimensional two-part partnership between the Republican bid would always have a bigger support team.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubiota at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bushia at 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
Ted Cruz and he's at the level.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson won a 19-minute trip from Trump in a two-pound picture.
The vast majority of Trump's supporters are already telling the vote decision they have made.
According to CBS and NYT, half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote.
The situation can be changed for many reasons, and at this moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46 per cent of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trupin is now a very competitive neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who have already voted on his proposal vote twice more likely to be Trumbia.
Six of the ten Republicans agree on the transferability of Trump's vision.
Donald Trump, who was invited to the campaign two months ago to move from Mexico, has been a hot topic in 2016.
Part of the concern is that the impressive words of Trump attract important Latin American voters from the republican groups and hinder the reform of the brand.
However, according to ABC News and Washington Post, six of the 10 republicans published today have the same lines of transfer with Trump.
As long as the transfer takes place, so is Donald Trump.
Disagreement with government is on the rise.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently gathering about half of the Republicans' voices.
In the republican groups, a small growth is proposed for a policy partner. According to ABC News and Washington Posts, this opinion was made up of six Republicans.
These two proposals are also very interesting for Washington.
According to the opinion reached in the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa have been affected by the activities of the Republicans at the Congress: 54 per cent are unhappy and 21 per cent at the border crossing."
Jeremy Corbyn debated at the Prime Minister's question
After the election, the Prime Minister's first meeting is expected to be held in the evening.
The working side of the lab's new music picture Jeremy Corbynin is determined to rise first by measuring his strength at David Cameron’s question hour later.
Corbyn asks the first six questions after a few afternoons. The information tools and the representatives of the working party follow a man with a strong eye.
Corbyn's turned down a smaller theatre and added the fact to the weekly show.
He has also made sure that he can leave some of his seats and leave them with his colleagues.
The Corbyn leadership is first drawn up in contact. Corbyn now has a parliamentary test to be conducted by the Conservative Board and the Corbyn Ammattiliits Central Organization at the TUC annual meeting.
In the 75-year-old season in Ison-Britania, organized during national security, the decision of the Labour Party has been criticized, in part, by several representatives of the Tory Party. The opinion has also been finalized in the search for a number of speakers.
Corbyin’s nature increased attention during the national song
The representative of Corbyin pointed out that during the National War, Corbyin was a quieter man with respect for the sovereignty of the Royal Air Force in the War of Britain.
In the BBC Two's Newsnight programme, Mr Owen Smith, on behalf of Corbynin, said that he would have called on half the leader to join the national party despite the responsibility of this monarch.
The Ten Secret Ministers have refused to leave, according to which Corbyin's units are divided into separate economic, defence and external affairs.
BBC policy editor Robin Brant considers that political differences in the EU's membership of the Ison-British Union and the granting of government benefits have been used in the workplace following the name of Corbyn.
At the TUC meeting, Corbyn said that the Labour will propose changes to remove the restrictions completely.
A few years later, Minister of Labour and Pension Smith of the Department of Safety said that the position of half is very clear: it only meets the government's plans to limit the number of 26,000 points to 26,000 points.
Corbyn is a five-year-old Labour Leader who met David Cameron during the last decade under the direction of the Tory Party.
The new approach agreed by the political leader, Labour, tells Cameron that the questions raised by the general public are raised by 30 000 proposals.
According to Corbyn's selection of the Islington Northian electorate, there are too many similarities. He also promises to avoid harsh words and greed and instead say that he focuses on serious issues, such as poverty, inequity and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that Minister Angela Eagle will bring him in for an hour, for example, when Cameron is outside.
Corbyn has also failed to express the view that others might also be able to speak to each other, and he is talking to the President of the House of Parliament, John Bercowin.
As Corbyin grew up in 2005, Cameron said that he wanted to be involved in a bedtime policy, which is often associated with the hour of question, but some years later he admitted his failure in his attempt.
Since the first time the hour of question was broadcast in 1990, it has been regarded as a central meter of appreciation, management of the premises and position. However, according to critics, the hour of question has become a caricaty type, which requires considerable reforms.
"Shot in Joburg" for young photographer
The centre of Johannesburg is a dangerous environment for the homeless.
The previous Catholic groups have found an ideal way to learn and learn.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a win-win in-depth description study, which teaches homeless young people to take pictures from their homes and deserve the same.
BBC News met a young man who was made through the project in the first group.

The point is confirmed on the rise of the British Ison
The point was confirmed at the top of the prizes in Isosa-Britania, and SABMiller took the rise of FTSE 100.
In October-June, the wages rose by 2.9 per cent in Isosa-Britania compared to the corresponding update last year.
The rapid growth proposed was then rapid in 2009.
The point was determined by 1 per cent and its rate was recorded at $1,555. The point was also established in relation to the euro, and the price was EUR 1,3730.
FTSE 100 index increased by 1.49 % and ended at 6,229.21 points.
The biggest rise was SABMiller, whose rate dropped by 20% when the company received the initial competitive offer from AB InBevil.
When it comes to trade, the world's two major oil companies would be combined and other fuels under the same roof, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry share increased by 0.9 per cent in the age of positive results of the Richemont group, which was competitive in the general industry.
Richemont's latest sales conditions are better predicted, and the development of the sale also led to growth in the Burberry open market in China.
Glencore's share increased by 5 per cent by reporting the debt to a single share of $2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The spare parts of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest drop of 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company's shares in the sales plan.
The JD Sport rate increased by 3.1 per cent after the company announced that its production would increase by 83 per cent to 46.6 million points before taxes.
JD Sports -pomo: Larger payouts could damage enlargement
According to the chairman of the JD Sports Group, Peter Cowgiln, the minimum wage in the United Kingdom would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, rising labour costs can threaten JD Sport’s expansion plans and reduce the need for additional work.
Metcash launch against Aldin's assault campaign
Metcash strives to protect its IGA memory from Aldin’s power in South and West Australia.
Metcash food aid has been launched to maintain a food security campaign to maintain the market share of IGA development teams in South and West Australia against the invasion of the Australian dollar of Aldin 700 million.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South and Western Australia in the first year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands by marketing in government and social media, as well as by organizing events such as Adelaide show.
IGA mines and manufacturers, as well as many fires, are included in the campaign. For example, Simmo, located in Dunsborough, offers pets in IGA mines, and shops sell to customers of the canteens of South Australia football games at low cost.
Metcashi is expected to publish more accurate information on the defence strategy on 29 September, where food, alcohol and iron trade is organised on the annual date of investment.
This is important for the markets, as South and Western Australia is about 30 per cent of Metcashi IGA mines, and in these areas there is a loss of production greater than in the IGA mine network of the former Member States.
South and eastern Australian consumers are known for their citizenship, and IGA branches also have significantly higher market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has 30% and 24% in Western Australia, while only 14% in the former countries are involved.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi will drop 5% of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of the opening of the first shops.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that the sale of IGA chips could amount to 360 million and the sale of Metcashi $250 million by the end of 2016.
The advantage is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 sales in South and West Australia in the first year and sell 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in these areas.
Metcashi's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food supply and volume can mean a loss of $13 million before the peaks and taxes, Kierath realizes.
At the same time, Metcast has market share in the former countries mainly for Aldi and Coles, although, according to a recent investigation by Roy Morgan, IGA’s customers are the most reliable.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food consumption will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week the resident manager of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, told Melbourne that he was very likely to lose Metcash within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take public stand for Douglas' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcashi Government contacted Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has decreased by 18 per cent since 2010, and the result of the Metcashi food business of 1200 IGA is reduced by 43 per cent at 2012 level.
However, the retail operator is engaged in countermeasures and makes over 150 million Australian dollars an annual rate to meet the prices of Coles and Woolworths per week for hundreds of products. Ketju wants to support sales in refurbishing sales so that they can increase the supply of product products and improve the food preferences of its own brands.
According to Metcash, the price revision and sales reform plans are in good shape, and the company is able to re-grow up in 2017 for the first time in four years.
President Steve Healy of the Australian tennis club defends Thanasi Kokkinaki
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be used instead of the specific criteria of the country.
According to the president of the Australian tennis club Steve Healthy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a popular victim in the recent episode of Nick Kyrgios. Kokkinakis deserves the country's special criticism.
"Special K" was named by two younger parties in Kokkinakis, when the bad boy Kyrgios tried his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly thereafter, in the Cincinnati game between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge had to separate the competition partners from each other. "Wowrinka should have given the Kirgios and my friends," said Harrison.
In the open United States, Kokkinakis is a country that has been damaged by the earthquake when powerful cramps have hit his target. Healy has been faithfully protected from Kokkinaki.
At present, the workshop is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Grothin, two of the simple doubles of Bernard Tomic's behind Davis Cupin in the Isoa-Britania semi-finals.
"I firmly believe that Thanas has been beaten with a knife," said Healy.
"He broke the mail when he lost his office in the open in the United States. He's not the first player to break his mail because of corruption. I know Thanass's blood well that he's not done well.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provable use of Harrison in the open in the United States, and he deserves recognition from me.
He's got a strong team and a strong family around him, and I think he's just a little unfair to me.
He is very capable of 19 years of age, he does hard work and he has a good team. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected in the middle of the players. He exercises hard, has a good person and is really strong and capable of a young man. I think he should be evaluated on the basis of his own sea."
Healy also supported the decision to drop from the Kyrkgios Australian team as a family from the beginning of an important cycle. He describes the solution as a common decision for all parties. However, he supports Canberra's return to the group as a long-term commitment.
"First of all, we want to focus entirely on the mistakes of Kyrgyzstan," Healy said.
Nick has raised his voice quickly. Like Federer and Murray have noticed, the young man has to prepare for the public vote. He deserves to be criticized for his bad mistakes. However, we try to support him so that he can understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to arrange for him his own peace. I believe it is best for the whole group and for Nick."
Europe's transition crisis: Hungary publishes emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
In the summer, Hungary closed its southern borders of Serbia as a hostage and arrested illegal peasants. The aim was to prevent the transfer of power.
The border was hit by hundreds of immigrants entering non-traditional countries, and Serbian authorities reacted violently.
Poor people had to stay in the middle of the country's inspection times for an unlimited period of time.
The market began to rise on the surface.
On the plane of the police helicopter, they called out "Open the Borders!" and shouted out loud to the Hungarian melkapolies.
Some went into protest at the food and drink camp.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it would not accept the transferees to be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of a solution, not to add harm.
The situation needs to be discussed in Brussels recently and also in other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Six days later, between Hungary and Serbia, a group of 28 countries failed to develop a common transitional policy at a Chinese meeting in Brussels.
However, the Ministers felt that 40 000 asylum seekers were responsible for arriving in Italy and Greece, and at the meeting, they hoped that by the end of the month or by the end of the year they would enter into an agreement with the EU Member States to take over 120 000 immigrants, including Hungary.
Mr Angela Merkel and Mr Täääland were invited by the German Federal Republic to attend the summit for the following week in order to be able to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary did not wish to take long action in Brussels or neighboring countries.
In the meantime, the emergency situation has developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions have been able to take the most effective steps, namely to close you and speed up the legal process related to security matters.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a long-term approach to the Romanian border to prevent the crossing of the border from the direction now that the Serbian border is ready to help.
CBS News writer Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were involved in the final tender agreement between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a very clear bottleneck and transit through the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that most of the people arriving there are survivors, not those who have the right to seek security, but those who have different views from other EU countries, including Germany.
According to a new law in Hungary, it is a crime to exceed or damage four metres of a long distance, which the government has implemented to the southern border of Serbia. The laws also set out more lasting prisoners for sentenced people.
"Because of the situation of mass migration, the government publishes a crisis in the country," reported government reporter Zolta Kovacs to suppliers in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We're building a strong line: the border is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to accept the military measures expected in the first week, and at the level of the Associated Press News Committee, it has already seen a number of days of heavily armed soldiers on vehicles and military equipment.
Orban's Internal Security Adviser, Gyorgy Bacondi, said that the authorities have taken over 45 crossings at the border immediately and 15 longer.
As a result of the breach of the border, people who have escaped from the border are now under police control, and they are charged with crimes on the basis of new laws.
Officials are trying to help.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossings on the border of Serbia, one border crossing point was closed by the border crossing.
Gaos ruled in the capital city of Roszke near Hungary when the Hungarians opened a small metal count in which people packed into it.
About 20 could be inside, but thousands were left outside.
A second group of immigrants joined Serbia and Hungary. People announced that they were in the area of food and drink until they were saved in Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's leader, Bernie Sanders, confirmed by the national gallery
First Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton's percentage of support continues to be a double-numbered national presidential candidate for democracy.
Clinton's support is now 47 per cent of the votes of the Democrats (58 per cent) while Sanders is another 27 per cent under the influence of 27 per cent (up to 17 per cent).
Former President Joe Biden has not yet reported his possible departure to the Presidential Council, with 15 per cent of his support for democracy.
More than five months before the majority of democracies are given too long to tell who they are.
However, Clinton's supporters are more likely to choose from other sponsors.
CBS News in the last month after the gallop that takes place, Clinton has lost the support of a number of democratic groups, while the Sanders team has joined the new supporters.
Clinton still has a leading position in women and Malta, but the leadership has been disappointed.
Clinton's support in the middle of men has fallen significantly, and he only has five percent of the language to see Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership in the middle of a 50-year-old democracy, and he is now at levels with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage between parents.
In recent months, the positive effects of Clinton's suffering on the liberal middle of Sanders's liberality have been double, but now Sanders has taken five percent of the language of Clinton in this group.
About half of the democracies declare their support to Clinton in its opinion if they are elected as a candidate.
The fourth would support Clinton's small stock, and 15 percent would support him just because he's willing.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic supporters if they were selected as candidates.
There is more to be confused in the midst of those who are not currently suffering as Clinton. Only about four quarters would support him with zeal.
48 per cent of the democratic voters would be supported by Clinton, and only 35 per cent of the Republican voters would be strongly supported by the most highly recommended Republican candidate, Donald Trumpa.
When Clinton's voters are asked to explain freely why they support his proposal, the recommended basis is Clinton's correct experience (16 per cent). Secondly, the recommended answer is that it is time to choose the president (13 per cent) and thirdly that Clinton is the best candidate (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mention his contact with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
In addition, joint views and opportunities will be mentioned to overcome early choices.
The vice-president still proposed, and 57 per cent of the democratic voters would like to go to prison, and thirdly, he would like to leave the country.
When a second candidate is informed by the democratic voter, most of the candidates are elected by Biden.
On the other side of Clinton's supporters, Biden has been recommended for the second time and has significantly improved Sandersa's recommendation.
If Biden does not go to democracy's probationary, Hillary Clinton will increase its progress towards Sanders. Sanders is with 20 percentage units, and it will grow to 30 percent if Sanders does not go to jail.
55% of Democrats consider Clinton to be a candidate, which has the best opportunity to overcome the current elections. However, the share has fallen from 78% in the last month.
The Biden in both is far away from Clinton, but more than ever, he believes in Biden's possibilities to win the old elections.
However, democratic voters consider views on the potential of the candidates in question to be more important.
The voters do not consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be unacceptable.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be fit for their characteristics.
Most consider Clinton, Sandersia and Bidenia to be real, reliable and guiding.
Bideni is often created as real when Clintonia is considered to be most often the type of driver.
Of the democratic voters, up to 30% don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, Sandersa is 15%. 27% can't say if Sanders is honest.
From the opinion of the Democrats, the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to their own ideology.
For all the properties, there is no opinion on Sanders.
When speakers are asked about the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail and his own service as Foreign Minister, most democratic speakers are told that they are pleased with Clinton's explanation, and it has not changed their approach to Clinton.
More American minds are different.
Half of the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's finding, and only three are satisfied.
The people’s opinions were divided in March, when the explanation had just become public.
Most Americans consider that the use of a negative email has not affected their overall image of Clinton. 36% say that the mind has changed to a negative direction.
Of this 36 per cent, the majority of six out of ten are Republicans.
Although the voters on their part consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is a risk of improvement in these features when it is asked about the views of all voters: Clintonia is considered to be honest and reliable only 32 per cent, which is 8 per cent units less than last month and 15 per cent less than May.
62 per cent of all voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55 per cent of all voters throughout the country also do not feel real and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump have good values for guidance.
From the sixth point of view of the present proposal, Bidenia, Carsonia and Bush were considered more reliable.
Most people consider Sanders to be honest, but just like Carson, many don't have the opinion of Sanders.
The answer to this question is 351 votes, and the error margin is 6 per cent.
Ben Carson's stealing Donald Trump's promotion in national support
According to CBS News and New York Time's latest support issue, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trumpie.
These two proposals have taken over half of the votes on the new issue and have left the other candidates behind for a long time.
In the middle of the country's representatives, Trump is still in prison. The rate of support has risen before Fox News in the last month to 23 per cent of the claim made by CBS.
However, Carson’s support was a bad rise in the same period, 6 percent to 23 percent.
According to the question, Carson has a strong support in all the groups, and in the high-school group, he's suddenly attacking Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, will stay long. Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker's support is weakened and has fallen by 10 percent in the last month to 2 percent now.
The former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio, distributed 6 per cent of their third position.
There are 6 per cent or so in the case of the former Marginal 376 of the Republican voter. Question was made in September.
According to the latest issue published by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is rising, with 19% of the Republicans supporting him when Trump's support is 32%.
Also in the latest issue of ABC News and Washington Posts, Trump was clearly leading in front of Carson.
In the last week of the men's meeting, Trump filed irreparable accusations against the newly married neurosurgery. However, Carson apologized for his belief in Trumpin.
"We need energy," Trump said on the morning of his campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the department were charged with Baruch College's death.
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student who was killed in a ritual in the province of Poconovuor, Pennsylvania, five people were murdered.
Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Psin's members have been badly tortured by the Raast Chun "Michael" in the late September 2013 in Deng's schools. According to the police, the department did not deliver Denge to a hospital at the time, which was considered to have an adverse effect on his death.
According to the authorities, the eyes of the victim were tied, his eyes were set on a 15-kiln-kilce-filled rappu, and his hipping was used repeatedly in his attempt to get to the point where he was placed on the side of the wall.
The money will be told first of all the headaches and then the loss of consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Psi department did not call the emergency number when Deng lost his mind. They are said to be waiting an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Police officer Chris Wabner told the press that, however, the members had to change the clothes of Deng, cut his pain, and contact the president of the department, Andy Mengi.
"At this stage, the members began to hide the tools by putting the Department's interests ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
The ding can't survive, and he died the next morning.
According to the Journal of the Body of the Cells, Dengi had been cut several times by the dust of the head, the upper chamber, and the journeys.
"A large number of families have had to be affected by the symmetry of the department, as at least one student died in the year since 1970," said Dr. Douglas Fierberg in his opinion.
The departments and their members shall be responsible for taking an important step by the authorities.
Five members of the department were brought to trial for the murder of the third stage.
In addition, 32 members of the department receive charges of fraud and criminal secrecy.
"We want to receive only one reply, including an official or informal approval organisation," Wagner told the press office as aunts.
The Baruch College set up the Department's mandate, and the national department withdrew from the operation of the local department.
I saw the rise of the central bank (Fedin) in the United States
The growth of the crops and the growth of the share markets have deteriorated, the production of securities increases and the economy is moving to slow down.
We know that.
And we don't know how long it's been, and how long the effects will last.
Especially with regard to the economy, we will find a history of time-consuming.
The lama has reached up to 11 months after the first peaks and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank is often aggressively proud, not always. The root cause is how the economy and financial resources react.
Therefore, the central bank authorities have already stressed with great satisfaction that investors should not be taken into account when raising the peaks but only how long the normalisation of the situation would lead.
There are a number of changes to the matter.
In the end, however, market operators may note that all the noise related to the rise of the peaks can be mixed.
"The first rise of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly due to the often significant ending of poor money," Julian Jessop, the chief of the Capital Economics, told customers about the global economy.
On the other hand, we do not expect a slow normalization of the mountains to a very low level, which is a lot of fear of standing.
However, it does not mean that there are no effects.
Here are examples based on historical trends of how the effects can be seen in the various areas of the economy:
As the market has already seen for about a month, the tendency to rise heights can increase uncertainty for some time.
When the eggs finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"Trendin would appear to be the replacement of capital surplus products for the first 12-24 months after the first rise, which would reopen the gap in monetary policy, the Deutsche Bank's analysis of the short-term impact on the growth of the peaks.
Over the 35 years, the market has generally seen a steady rise in peaks, about 14 per cent, almost 250 days (mean increase 2.6 per cent), and 500 days later, and the average peak output after six shares is 14.4 per cent, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Manager's Chief Equity Strategy in Barron's chapter.
According to Deutsche, the impact on the components is generally increased in a slightly later stage of the cycle and the peaks begin to decrease.
The Lama is real in the economy, but the rise of the peaks usually depends on it.
In this case, if the central bank is concerned about conditions that were not in existence before and which could speed up the cash flow.
A special point is that the gross profit is at least the lowest in the central bank's leadership base for thought.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the year 1950, only a nominal value was less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 showed 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it to be sustainable, and the third quarter was 1.5 per cent, reports the Atlantic Regional Central Bank.
At the height of the peaks in such a proud economic situation may be at risk and may be asked if this situation is different, Deutsche said.
Market participants have talked about the rise of the leadership team throughout the year, and they are also going to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends in the storm.
Many strategies and economies believe that although the Open Market Committee would accept an increase at this meeting, the Futour Summit only shows a 25% probability.
"In our research since 1950 all the peak cycles have been in supercycles today, which will also increase BKT by very rapid growth," says the report.
The recovery has been very short compared to the worst of the drug use.
The cycle is clearly short, which the central bank has been waiting for since last year. The previous was 35 months, now it's gone in 74 months.
The value-added securities have also been inadequate for the purpose of the market, and the plan is also restored by capital.
"The obvious difference is that the effect is faster in the collective accounts than in the shares when the central bank changes the rates.
With regard to the batches, the product appears to change the direction immediately when the first rise/duty cycle is started.
At the end of the growing cycle, the products will be counted immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwabin strategists believe that the Coronist will get long and short-term team cards to approach each other and move them to a level playing field.
"In this environment, collective stock exchanges are often better, although we are still cautious about products," said Kathy Jones, an analysis of the real estate securities of Schwaby.
Yes, it is surprising that, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future direction of the central bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the adjustment of the financial policy, there are already many signs," says Jones.
The short-term curves are rising, the production rate is direct, credit marginalisation has increased and volume increased. All are typical in the market situation where the central bank divides policy.
In general, companies operating mainly on the United States market benefit because the level of growth is low and local products start to fall under demand.
The views of committed multinational companies are weaker, as a stable dollar will bring their products to world markets and the price of debt.
"Historia shows that quality shares are more productive in the next three months," Goldman Sachsin analysts refer to customers.
The companies at which level is strong have led to a fall in the level of enterprises in 1994, 1999 and 2004 in the middle of five percentage points.
Companies whose capital is high and low-voltage shares have also resulted in better quality, medium-sized 4 and, respectively, 3 percentage points.
"There's a big question.
Companies that have a significant share of exchange rates will lose most," Goldman said.
Consumers outside the market are generally also benefiting from the strengthening of the dollar.
Rescuers are also benefiting from higher production, and experts are really special about how fast the effects can be.
Parliamentary copy by Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 on Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the spread of radio space.
According to Bingham, the canal is now difficult to distinguish itself from the commercial competitor.
Also refer to BBC Music Awards as a copy of the Brits Gaal.
For Damien Collins, Parliamentary Commissioner is accusing The Voice of the inhumanity.
According to the noted parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of the Classic FM as a copy.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC that the radio station has become too popular and can no longer distinguish itself from its commercial competitors.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 feels a change in the direction of Classic FM," Bingham said.
Also in the last December, BBC Music Awards will receive the following criteria from Bingham:
"Last year's first organized BBC Music Awards are influenced by a copy of the British court.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of new and different, we are only going to visit what is already on the market," Bingham says.
The president of the BBC rejected the charges and admitted that BBC Radio 3: offers a much more live music and choice of content for a commercial competitor.
"Radio 3: from learning classical music about what I can't learn from other channels.
The Canary Islands' commitment to making music and music is exactly its own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to looking for new music and finding new works," the president said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's leader Alan Davey stated that his position must be more difficult than his job to keep his public interest, as the British know more about classical music than ever.
Radio 3 is not, however, the only strong criticism of the conduct of commercial channels' revisions has been shared by the BBC channel, the limited cultural, media and sports committees.
Tory-Speed MP Damien Collins assessed The Voice’s capacity-building contract, which BBC purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Medial. The price of the product is estimated at 22 million points.
"The programme will not be discussed just because it is not unique or particularly distinct."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way to BBC.
In addition, Collins asked the company to look for an emergency program on its own, when it next launchs a new emergency.
Collins, however, did not agree to close down the fact that The Voice would continue to exist or that the taxpayer’s funds would be used in other late forms.
The growth of the network trade in all ages in August – the cause of the black landscapes
In the first month of 2015, online sales increased by seven per cent.
The sales of the network market have been recorded since 2000. In the last month, the growth has been the hottest of all times.
The network store was established three years later after the mobile.
Experts believe that in November, your family may be able to hide purchases.
Over ten years of online sales have assisted many of Britain’s purchases.
According to the respondents, there are references to net sales to be resales, and new sales volumes show only seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was intense throughout your lifetime when the sales of the web market have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. In the last year, the internet sales increased by only five per cent.
According to the respondents, there are references to net sales to be resales, and new sales volumes show only seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
"When compared to the last year's growth to the 2000 readings, it is clear that growth is being measured over time," Immrg’s chief executive, Andy Mulcahy, told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, online sales increased three years after consumers paid for their mobile.
"I was able to buy more and more from the network, and for many it was possible to buy in different environments, even if at home.
When mobileization is more complex now, growth can be measured."
The black family from America is a phenomenon that is considered one reason for slowing down growth.
According to the respondents, the day of the last spring of November may allow consumers to terminate their purchase decision before the black holidays.
In the last year, a five-fold number of web users, compared to normal, were able to lose a lot of online sites.
Experts believe that your black family, which is allowed to attract consumers after the tenders, may be able to shut down purchases at another time.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, every five points were spent online.
Some products, such as television and toilets, are purchased from online stores over three times.
At the same time, more than four people buy clothes and wear a net instead of the models they bought.
The Mekash is responsible for the deaths of victims, the Bin Laden family
The Muslims placed 29 bodies of victims on the streets when the first healers were organized in Mexico.
According to Saudi Arabia, Saudi Binladin Group is a major undertaking in the construction sector of Saudi Binladin.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were killed after they were killed.
The bodies were mounted high in the air when the Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the cataclysmic plague on the Mekka Major.
The missing were gathered with a group of white-headed people to leave their best victims on their last trip to Al-Moaisse's funeral.
Traveled to a shrine, where the lost building tower was only a day when the mosque was destroyed by a massacre on the Muslim side.
The king of Saudi Arabia demanded that Bin Laden build a family business on the responsibility of the accident, with 394 people in addition.
In the case of the failure of the Mekka Grandfather, 29 victims were killed in the streets.
In a group of the dead, there was Qasim Akram from Bolton, the capital of the Greater Manchester, who had traveled to Mexico for the first time on the pilgrimage.
Akram had been with his parents in Great Mosquito, who had started their annual pilgrimage.
The authorities of Saudi Arabia have agreed that haij-san-sanction will be organized when thousands of people reach the best for the city's sacredness.
According to King Salman, Binladin Group would not have been able to leave the nest tree on the ground when the nest was not used.
According to the Arabic press report, Binladin Group is involved in an accident.
However, according to the English report, the management of the group has been prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what led to the destruction of the tower at the Grand Shrine. The gods' Muslims are heading to the Great Potter's pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any information on non-compliance, nor has the Group's representatives been targeted for the opinion.
The King also accused the Group of failing to comply with the modern security rules and cooperate with the meteorologists.
The ten nobles surrounded the Mekka Great Lakes as part of the remaining building project of Binladin Group.
The Bin Laden family has had close contacts with the Saudi-Arab government family for ten years, and Bin Ladeni has responded to many important construction projects.
Al Qaida's former leader, Osama bin Laden, was a Luopio boy who had been rejected by the family during the 1990s.
A few days before the Holy Creatures of Mecca, the obligation of every able Muslim to do at least once in life, was fulfilled in the face of a severe storm.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital care.
Officials determined to pay millions of rents (EUR 250 000) to the owners and permanent residents of the victims.
In the event of an accident, other damages will be recovered from the amount of compensation.
According to the B&Q point, there is a poor job in Eastern Europe
Brits hire domestic generals more often than ever, says Veronique Lauriy.
The Council has increased the skills available from Eastern Europe, professional workers working.
More than 200 new Screwfix, designed for men, will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q miles around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Editor, Daily Mail
It is said that Britain will move its home to refurbished and landfill for producers from Eastern Europe.
Vaccination and soil pollution are very rare today.
The British are now more and more of the generals of the house to handle domestic firefights, reports B&Q's manager of the company.
Veronique Lauriy is a new supply manager in Kingsfisher, who owns the sale of household maintenance supplies. According to Lauren, in the light of the evidence, professional workers from Eastern Europe are available at a high price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new, designed for life-threatenings with a Screwfix memory. The same 60 B&Q memory is closed.
Laurie wants more women's activities in B&Q, because eight ten purchases are made by a woman.
At present, most of the staff are men.
Lauren says that attention is being paid to public relations, since more and more single women are now being treated at home.
"Our personality is still the biggest part of men," said Lauriy.
"We must balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the product purchase decisions are made by a woman.
Women must play an important role in the decision-making process."
Lauriy is one of five women who are behind companies belonging to the British FTSE 100 index, and she has also reorganised the company's leadership group so that both men and women's leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only quality, as 50 per cent of its staff are women, including the delivery director and the financial director.
"This was a certain decision, and the majority is important to us," said Laurie.
"It has not been hard to find good women in the leadership group."
In the course of the year, the kingfisher's business and sales licenses are low, even though the company has been able to work more handy after sales are stopped.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q kits and intends to open 200 new shops.
The three governments have just decided to secure the proposed legislation in order to save the economy of the country.
The visible effects were soon reached.
The head of the SAK and other pension institutions began to pressure the same way and, as a result, the country stands out as a whole because of the broad opinion of the workers.
It's time for many people to think about it, too.
Let's ask ourselves if we're gonna be able to hang around when it's going bad.
It's even built up against the counter-trafficking.
More than 50,000 people in the network have already been informed that they are not going to participate in the country of thought but go to work.
Such a good old consensus would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no net in which to protest, but openly declaring crime would have been a small political suicide.
Millions of professional organisations have little time to protest a few tens of thousands of people, but the subject of thought gives it.
The position of the trade union is no longer as clear as it was a year ago.
Not all are aware of the objectives of the movement, values have changed
In view of the interest of the Ay movement, the solutions of the government can also be seen as a wonderful gift from heaven.
When things have been going on for years, it seems that they have become increasingly self-depressed, that is, they are now late in the alliances, namely the rights of the worker to defend, clearly and properly.
The government may thus wish to assume the role of the ay movement when membership in the professional community is seen to be more important.
In any event, there is a need for organizations to stop Finland from doing anything they think they want.
Yes, Finland's stopped for a while ago.
For example, industrial production has been counted 31 months ago.
Gross imports continue to decrease, and unemployment continues to rise.
You thought all of these things were going to be hard on everyone.
Severe savings to the University of Lappeenland: Objective 8.5 million, staff will be reduced by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenrann will launch a life-threatening course aimed at costing a total of EUR 8.5 million.
In part, the University of the University will initiate the YT negotiations on the entire staff, with a total of 6.5 million targets per year.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 workers.
In addition, there are two million other activities to be saved.
In the context of the YT negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to fall by 8.5 million.
This also affects the government's accounting practices.
At this level, the university is making about 2.6 million of the result.
The expenditure will grow slightly in the first year, but the same funding from the ministry will be reduced by 2 million and another funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total university budget is about EUR 85 million, so the target is 10 per cent of the total budget.
The impact of the distortions of mass education and research and the reduction of corporate funding on our university level is very important, says Dr. Anneli Paul in his report to the University of Applied Sciences.
Before long, the effects of the cuts were even more subtle, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears to be in new dimensions.
Negotiations with trusted men will be initiated for the first week of the week and will continue for a period of six weeks.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
The South Bus Company Onnibus's owner, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also responsible for rail transport in Finland.
I'm very interested in going to Finland's railway transport.
Stageceach is one of Britain's largest railway companies, Souter tells it.
Railway transport is to be opened to competition from time to time.
The first is the traffic of the capital city in 2017-2018.
After the traffic, there's a long train.
Souter tells the Ministry of Transport that he's already approached.
According to Ylen, the Ministry of Transport considers the plans of Onnibus to be welcome.
Other international companies have reported their interest in rail transport, at least Transdev (formerly Russia), which has so old bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
U.S. Central Bank settlement time
The entire world follows the United States Central Bank meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will conclude the possible rise of peaks for the first time in almost twelve years.
In the last week, half of the economics that still believed that the central bank would set its peaks now slows to 0 to 0.25 per cent of the current central bank's remaining peak. This is evident from the question of the Reuters 80 economic operators.
"This is a historical situation, because the central bank has been holding the crown of zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a significant central bank can raise its peaks by zero and thus start a normalization of the peak levels," said researcher Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics.
In the United States, the economic situation has been relatively good, and survival has brought billions of additional dollars and has only accelerated inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore the global situation that is not the same as the Russian.
It has called on markets to save change, but also references to the opposite are obvious.
This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union at 20 a.m.
Delta State University shooting left an apology table
After his girlfriend was shot in Mississip on Monday morning — before a fellow colleague shot the same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologized for his first murder and hoped that he could recover it, the authorities told him as traitors.
Mississipp in Gautiers Delta State University, the teaching country and community information Lamb called a emergency number about 10 o'clock in the morning
in the morning, he told the man his bomber.
Lamb asked the police to come home in the morning.
"My dear wife's last night," said Lamb. She also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which is not a bother to anyone but who is probably afraid.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but the man didn't tell it.
And neither did Lamb tell the motive of the shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, in the body and Lambine, I wrote a message which read as follows: "I am very sorry, and I hope I can cancel my actions.
I loved Amya, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After I wrote a letter, Lamb walked 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of History before his own soul was burned on the ground the day he was tried by the police.
Dr. William LaForge told the university that there was no known dispute between Lambine and Schmidt, but he realized that Lambia was clearly in trouble.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb was likely believed that the Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but the authorities reported to him that there was no information or evidence from the trimiogram.
In the seven-year marriage with Prentiss, Shawn O'Stee was created to be a good man for his wife.
The Parisian society had separated 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's been raped.
According to the man, the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, his close friend Lindsay Knowles told him that Prentiss was working on the network at all times.
Knowles admitted that Prentiss had been dating Lambin for three years, and he also told her about the dog named Lighting.
"He always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
According to the police, Lamb had been calling on social people during the country and told them he wasn't going to go to prison.
When the police aimed at Lambin Highway 1 at Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, packed the street, went to the woods, and washed his own soul.
According to a survey at the University’s website, Lamb received a doctor’s report on growth at Delta State University in June 2015.
Hemmentised symptoms
In recent years, there have been heavy samples (on the left of her son in Redmond's follow-up).
In 2001 he fought the leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcet went to bed.
The sample has also been mixed with toxic substances, and in 2008 he was arrested for the use of toxic substances.
It's all happened. It's really required your tax.
Manchester United Luke Shaw page for two months
Luke Shaw's right leg was hit by Manchester United Masters at the PSV Eindhoven.
The defendant is forced to stay on the side for at least half a year, but Louis van Gaal is still active and believes that Shaw will return to the village this far.
The 20-year-old Shaw broke down in the PSV defense area at Héctor Morenon in a bad train when he was in the game for five minutes.
Shaw was in the field for nine minutes and needed a cure before she was able to move to the hospital.
"Shaw's got two broken legs, and he's in the hospital," said Van Gaal.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or tomorrow.
The 18-year-old young man associated with the Manchester Uneted race has experienced violence and is now shocked after the great games.
They gave Shaw a kiss in the bathroom.
The man's asleep.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks off from two points, she's on the side for half a month and she's not playing in the leg.
I hope he can still play this way.
Moreno was able to escape a little while when the situation did not follow the red card penalty.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli is not a famous Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian officer made a mistake.
"You can decide for yourself, but I think your situation was worth a penalty and a red card.
There was a two-way management office."
Shaw tweeted: "Thanks to all of your messages. I can't describe how upset I am.

English defences have a special reason to intend to be held in France in scheduled European arms race negotiations in June.
"It's a very bad mess," said the PSV's promulgator.
"In such cases, all parties are always very sorry.
The aim of the players is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his arms while he was playing in the streets of Van Gaal in Mexico, establishing the Netherlands against the 2014 World War II.
"He's very sorry, because his intention was not to harm the opponent. It's a shame to hear that both are serious," said Cocu.
"I didn't see the situation.
I saw only a ball that was going on the other side, so it seemed that he (Moren) was touching the ball, but I didn't see Luke's face."
"I know how it feels, I know how difficult your situation may be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"I'm really sorry."
Andres Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after a stroke with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Each parent will notice before the child learns his favorite book outside.
Except you see David Cameron.
When the Children's Association asked Cameron to name the children's books, Prime Minister Loraxin elected, an environmental director who was published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
In a text published by the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, fun and creative, and there is a powerful message. I like to read it to my children, because there is always some picture or message that we haven't noticed before."
It sounds good, except that the following point, in which Cameron is meant to describe a book, is the 2012 film version, which adds new ideas and details to supplement the short text.
"In Tarville City, where the right trees and plants have been destroyed and even without being commercialized, lives a boy named Ted who wants to escape his dream in the heart of the daughter Audrey by performing this greatest dream: to see the right tree," says the text. In 1991, Dr. Seussin, or Theodor Seuss Geesel, in his version, did not have a place of beauty in Tedil.
If this is not yet necessary, Cameron's text is part of an Internet Movie Database, which is connected to the Lorax unique system on the website. It begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is practical and even without the need for a trade, a boy named Ted who wants to save his daughter Audrey's heart."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book would have been so close to him. Without Kerskane, he destroyed the trees and prepared them for needs regardless of Lorax's opposition. Lorax is a small and fat, weekly creature that protects the forest.
Likely like this, a small p-word has been believed to be an assistant, apparently to someone who has not read Loraxia 20 times in the womb.
The Prime Minister said that the text was probably from Cameron's selection office.
SuperCamps did not comment on the matter more accurately, but confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff's manual.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being out of England's army, but it's still rare.
The meeting of Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a task, but we see that the final 3-0 test series is not expected to be repeated.
I wouldn't close the possibility of a visit.
Alessair Cook may be more experienced than a three-year-old team, but the team has good players and the team's position is strong – they have no bad experiences since 2012, but a young position.
As a football player, Moeen Ali develops as a racing player, and Adil Rashid, although he does not have a test phase experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Group and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth away is obviously difficult for me to understand as his chief governor in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks against challenging conditions, and the simple and clear fact is that the Greek players are assessed according to results.
For example, Joe Root is not a matter of choice because – as I said before – players are the best choices.
A few 50-point rulings should have been held in Lythin's group, but his court was in his own hands.
Hopefully, he'll get a new chance when he gets to Yorkshire more driving.
The Chief of England, Trevor Bayliss, called him to be installed also when he didn't do as well as he could, which doesn't surprise me, he's first all the team players.
The question of how long tests can have an effect is difficult.
Lyth received seven productions – like his predecessor Sam Robson – when Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home or a visit.
The only cause of the complaint may be that England used Jonathan Trottia first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in the summit – but this last opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales comes to the team, and he's the ones I value at the top.
He's an unknown cricket player, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this time when he made 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must have at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates.
Without it, the idea of Moeen starting with Cookin's lead year, when you get a lot of runners at the same time as four long-distance players, and I'm not against the idea.
I can't see to it that the kidnappers could be in a hurry here, and this left-handed player has already proved to be a great cricket player.
I don't think he's got a lot of locals in Worcestershire, but he's been a three-player team, and it's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played the first 38 test exercises as the first substitute player before he was able to start in 2001.
He just made three hundred points, and he wasn't coming back.
Zafar Ansari is in a group of stockbrokers, and on the basis of what I have seen from him, he has proved to be very impressive as a young man.
People can look at his statistics – at average 31 points in the shorts and at 35s – and this can be a search engine, but too many runners have not shown their readiness, and voters have decided to take the young player.
He learned a lot about this time of the night.
With the team outside the game, England is influenced by a couple of intelligent choices in the training team.
The appointment of Sri Lanka's latent Mahela Jaawaranden, may be a transitional appointment for the test services consultant.
This is one of the most noble of men, who brings much experience because he has played in all kinds of situations and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood will come to the part of the white ball of the pillar, including energy and incompatibility.
I think he's always been influenced by an appropriate international cricket, whether he's a player or a producer, and Mahela's way of thinking is useful to him.
Sometimes a new voice in the chat room, even if it said the same as it used to be, may be a prysychiatry.
Collyn's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has published one day's talks, Root's got the same chance against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not all agree, manufacturers and voters do not set a deadline for adoption.
And it must be borne in mind that the way players do their job depends on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
Brexit can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017
David Cameron's side left a renegotiation strategy for the maintenance of Britain in the EU, there is a day in the deeper favor, even if without the consent of the honourable Member Jeremy, Corbynia will choose to lead the working party or to the TUC, while visiting Europe in a strict fashion.
Other countries have their own Corbins and Nigel Faragens.
European diplomats have recently explained how many EU crises have taken place – although not all of them are their own. Some of the Member States have failed to adapt to the UK's own agenda, which includes the amendments to the Treaty which they do not even wish to make.
At the annual TUC conference in Brighton, it was concluded that they would not be in the EU if they were concerned about social security.
We could call it Daven and George's suicide agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Association Council are invited to attend meetings and bilateral negotiations in the capital cities of different countries, to take pictures of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-value figures, to return to their homes and to resume their accession to the relevant reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be in the EU's office in the United Kingdom. "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says and proposes that the more shortcoming Minister and official in various capital cities has come to that point, whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a reasonable associate in Germany, has been an associate but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the office before it falls, as happened to those who went too far: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
In France François Holland, there is a re-election or a subsequent election in 2017.
He's in a hurry, too.
On the other hand, there may soon be a nationalist administration, a left administration again in Spain.
It is difficult to imagine them trying to help selfish Brittes who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom. They do not want to do so, because most of them have separatist events.
Some of these ministers may wish to make any useful comments at the 2017 United Kingdom National Campaign, which is intended to involve Brexit's processes, propose my friend.
"The renegotiation negotiations have been arranged." "British has not left any of the renegotiation negotiations."
The Europeans know how the British Presidency is going and how the EU-Special oligarck Group is, just like Tony Benin's 1975 national vote, which resulted in the accession of 2:1 to the EU in 1973.
Someone reminds me of Boris Johnson, an effective Euro opportunist who came to be known as the "our EU-in-Office of the Banana Letters" in Brussels at the beginning of the 90th century.
Ed Milibang was at least aware of his anger.
These include taxes, phone calls, and visas, which represent most of the good of our wordbooks.
In fact, Tony Blair thought a lot about them, but then he realized that when he's in the dark with a karke gorilla, he's got to turn bananas into a trap so that the gorillas wouldn't eat you both hungry and daily.
Miliban was the more liberal than Blariak when he protested against the vote of the people, which was then rejected by the EU, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in 2005 it came to a close conclusion.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly deceived me into the Westminster country. I told him that he no longer has time to hurt me. It could be dangerous that he's taking advantage of the 80-year-old Niel Kinnock Mediaboat Strategy. It was wrong and still is.
Time can be spent, but Corbynin has to develop a consistent strategy with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, who sat in the BBC room on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we call for to implement.
He says he wants to keep us reformed in the EU.
Most of the people outside Ukip and Tory are probably able to respond positively to this.
That's what Hillary "Benn but Benniitt" told Ben on the radio and on the television this week, when his internal party boy tried to be reluctant to admit that Corbyn had a bad reputation for calling Karsik John McDonnell as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.
It reminded me of the 70th anniversary when her old father was having difficulty having an unusual TV interview with the labyrinths of the labyrinths without going too far and without losing their place in the basement.
Hillary's difficulties were more interesting.
Ben said that he was responsible for leaving the EU "in all circumstances". McDonnel did not say so and did not tell Corby's colleagues and members of the substation in the field.
You wanted Corby to take care of any image, it must be remembered that he even touched me. It is important for a 24/7-year-old, especially in a social media crash where paranoia and fraud are related.
Cameron does not need to provide EU passports that he might consider supporting Labour in his own referendum, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins is at least aware of this.
McDonnelly and Corbyn's equality between the EU was agreed to the anti-capitalisation of the island economy and capitalism, and the discussions were no longer limited to the left-hand side of the left-hand side thinkers, who thought that equality was a central part of the teaching campaign.
There has also been an ecviocation of Nathan. Tom Watson is unintended that Corbyn has not campaigned for his departure. Foreign diplomats must try to explain the matter to their families.
Why should Paris or Berlin withdraw from political capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they grant grants to Britain when everything is possible?
The United States has already broken down almost every law to the British military service in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the early stages of the Tory administration. I received a reminder on the day of the amendment in connection with the British Influence Security Forum.
The respondents criticized the British government's opinions on electricity savings
According to researchers, the State-funded agency claims that the burning of electricity is 95 per cent less harmful than traditional smoking, were born at a meeting involving 12 participants in the tobacco industry.
The respondents criticized the evidence presented in the report of the public health authorities in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal (PHE).
PHE described the last month's report as "replacemental and comprehensive review of results".
However, a number of researchers have questioned the safety of the data and highlighted the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
Lancet Medical Journal concluded in the last month that the most important conclusion of the PHE was to be based on the "study of a bright foundation".
In addition, two researchers have found in the BMJ whether claims are based on "study or small".
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine European Public Health Professor Martin McKee and Professor Simon Capewell of Liverpool’s University of Clinical Epidemiology, have proved the following: "The fundamental principle of public health is that the principles of action are based on their impact on a clear example."
According to McKeen and Capewell, the vast majority believe that PHE's claim that "the best estimate of electricity is about 95% less harmful than traditional fuels" should be based on a detailed analysis and simulation of research results.
You can download from one of the 12-person meetings, which were invited to the group to evaluate the target (multi-criteria decision analysis, MCDA) for the development of a model. The model wanted to harmonise the views of participants of nicotine products. The results were collected for the study.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting were included in the EuroSwiss Health meeting, which had previously been funded by the independent director of the supply chain according to sources by the British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, the Executive Director demonstrated its support for the work of the Sustainable Action Report in accordance with the National Health Programme of the Bat.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting, however, received an e-financing from the former financing company Philip Morris International.
However, there is no explanation for the selection criteria of the panel, including a number of known sponsors, who are part of their participation as a financial beneficiary of the industry.
However, part of the participants are not known for their awareness in the fight against smoking.
The meeting also participated in the PHE smoking programme.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the Panel's research report shows that it is not surprising that there is a wide range of products and compliance with their criteria.
However, complaints or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there has been no evidence of the possibility that electronic devices can promote smoking for children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell are considered to be early.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, a leader in PHE's health and well-being, the allegations have been answered earlier.
According to Fentonin, electricity is significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Any other people who smoke through life will die because of tobacco addiction.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks of electronic devices are lower than the risks of conventional tobacco. However, the long-term effects should be studied more closely.
PHE is responsible for informing citizens what the appearance shows and what it does not show, especially in situations where the relative risks to traditional tobacco are not comparable.
In the United Kingdom, there are about 80,000 deaths per year associated with smoking, and smoking causes public health costs of two billion dollars a year.
The responsible action requires that we clearly present a current phenomenon that does not allow electricity to be an alternative to the risk, but its causes are part of the traditional smoking disease.
BBC should leave East Enders, says Channel 4 -pomo
According to the East Enders and The Voice, according to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand of emergency, such as Albert Square, to the BBC.
According to Johnson, license payments should be used only for programs that other television stations do not.
He was likely critical of the fact that BBC's submission of smaller programmes to the general public was at the same time with the main target programmes of competitors, as well as with the BBC4 channel.
When BBC president Tony Hall had announced that the company wanted to cooperate with other organisations, Johnson said he had been trying to get Channel 4 to work with BBC for six years.
"I don't agree with the idea that BBC buys formats and send out programs that clearly listened to some competitive channel program," Johnson told the Parliament's high-level communications committee, which explained the future of BBC.
If BBC wants to maintain a general radio fee, which I do not think is necessarily a medium-term or long-term good idea, it should stop providing at least programmes that are not other products and purchases.
BBC will send The Voice to the best time of view because it wants as much support as possible in the future.
If no other channel cares about the program, it's clearly a rinse-staining shell.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should finance programs that could be financed without support," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, the EastEnders one, even though it is its own production.
A lot of canals would give them their right hand of it.
I don't understand how this serves the services of the general radio company.
I don't think these wouldn't be the loss to BBC."
Johnson is a historian who was leading Channel 4 in 2004–2010. He believes that BBC is losing good eyesight because it works in the company with respectable people and because they believe it is the best way to secure long-term support.
Johnson's comments on BBC's most popular series are similar to the previous Sky-Pomon Tony Ballin, who proposed MacTaggart in 2003 that BBC would remove such sites as East Enders.
According to Johnson, the programs for the BBC Niche-Yleis are shown as a BBC4 channel where viewers cannot measure most, but programs meet their purpose. "BBC can say in the field of the team's share of four billion-loan general radio charges by making special programs that no one has ever seen."
"BBC will present them at a time when no one will ever see them."
Johnson said: "I would ask you to look for someone else in the same old-fashioned system, who will benefit the best.
Of course, everyone thinks 150 pounds a year is a good one, but the people for whom it is a great amount, especially if BBC doesn't just look at it."
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also shared his views on the Committee as aunts, admitted that BBC should switch its former missions to new "information, learning and delay".
According to Elstein, the current BBC offer includes educational programs – 1 percent on television and 0.1 percent on radio. It adds that BBC should learn about Australian and Canadian public radio companies and pray for a new faith: "information, clarity and delay".
Elstein's cooperation proposal suggests that BBC could add invitations to events such as the Proms festival, which was sent only in the short part of the last year. "BBC should also be connected to the subsidized commercial channels, so that all offers are available on the network," he continues.
The brain cells can be controlled by sound cells using sound genetics
The video shows how uncanny changes their direction when they are placed on the outside.
Researchers have developed rats whose brain system has been genetically modified. So they can be guided by ultrasound.
Small dolls change their direction when they are placed on the surface of the surface, where the surface of the human ear is above the surface of the human ear.
Suspects have activated commercial greenhouse gases that have been genetically modified so that they have a transport vessel that reacts to the outer surface.
More on the subject: Researchers will follow the activity of brains using the power of the brain
According to the researchers, honey was used to show the effect of a new somnolative method (dubbes somgenetics). The procedure uses ultrasounds to activate brain, heart and body cells outside the body in the future.
Salk Instude, in California, La Jolla, told Guardian that one day the method can replace the cardiovascular (DBS) with the DBS. DBS treatment is an invasive method to use in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, where brains are stimulated by electricity.
I noticed, however, that the clouds are reacting when they are placed in a net containing a microscopic little hole.
According to Chalasan, the cubes strengthen the ultrasounds that penetrate the surfaces.
The confirmed ultrasounds affect TRP4 ionic acids, which are part of the balance sheets of the stomachs.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, the speakers will be able to open and activate the keys to which they are attached.
In order to guide unaccompanied species across the outer coast of Chalasi, the species genetically modified by the presence of TRP4-ion-channels in parts of their trade-leading species.
When the modified surfaces were directed to the surface, the micrococks strengthened the sound waves and moved to the ground where the signal was moving in hermos.
The procedure reminds us of a few optogenicities, which are a beautiful tool that allows researchers to activate hermosols by using the power.
However, according to Chalasan, there are certain advantages in sonogenetics compared with optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brains that are at the center of the study by means of images of light. The ultrasounds ultrasounds are replaced by the passing layer so that the ultrasound can be directed to the brains through the brains.
"We believe that with the help of gene therapy and virus treatment, human hermosols can be temporarily exposed to ultrasound signals in the clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the study, the method could also be used in body vessels and insulin cells.
Unencumbered explosives - your home!
The reports are a disgrace to the British military.
Look at Amnesty International's anti-sense video.
The cruel killers!
There's no fucking car!
We're gonna get out of here!
Avoidants who cause unintended pain but do not follow!
The famous voice and border images clearly show that this fame of the world's largest position is parody. Video is Amnesty International's production, and its purpose is to promote the British administration's attempt to sell weapons to category management DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) in methods organized in the exCel department in London Dockland.
More on the subject: DSEI: Authorised administrations reach London
There are also two newspapers for bus stations and metro stations that require a different focus.
"Truth notification: move on the meter 15.–18.9.?" The announcement reminds us of the announcements of the London Metro. At the entrance of the subway on the second floor there is also a picture of the tanker.
"In September, a number of armed soldiers will reach Docklands. Customers will be asked for help so that the seats can be stopped."
Three-thirds of the publications have been made by artists whose work has been on the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Design.
A colleague named Special Patrol Group helped the newspapers across London with a six-point "Ministerial application package", with six-cool periods, which, according to the claim, comes from about one third of the world's bus stops.
Transport for London is not a public service.
One of the Special Patrol Group's collections.
According to Cruel Designs, curator and lecturer at the University of Essex Gavin Grindon, artists have started asking questions and want to bring politicians to work outside the gallery.
Artists have noted that social impact through art requires that art be brought to the real world, and many are also moved to work with protest movement activists.
The other arms trade is welcomed by the users of public transport in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed through Facebook more than 100,000 times a month. It has been designed without compensation by the VCCP, as well as graphic designers and historians have also done their work without compensation.
VCCP's artistic leader, Matt Lever, welcomed the removal of the museum and empty location in the ExCeL's event calendar. He said, "Let them campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They tried to reduce the reality of what kind of company video they were, but church colors and animation give better attention to."
"They have done great work and have helped us to raise the garbage in which the plant is being used for commercial purposes," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now the government has to take action and ensure that we don't sell the explosives directly to our home."
However, the creation of the seating chain is still in the exhibition tables in ExCeLis, where sample manufacturers use bad circuits for commercial purposes.
In the press release, the United States reported on the situation of an army with regard to the "accompanied AT4CS RS".
The product consists of a "specially-designed fighter, which has an effective direct approach."
It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students living in student housing
11 years ago, I was a 19-year-old nun and I still believed in barthes and moral relativism. From now on, I remember the violent smiles of those who were angry, and countless, long complaints from others.
The most important lessons I can draw from the eight simple rules.
The change in the dwelling area must be the most difficult experience and the worst.
In the situation, it's easy to start with a year: tell everyone you are, do you like the middle of the year and why you like Corbyni and why not "real hate or love Marmite, because it's just a snowflake, ahhhhhhhhhhhh, I'm in my room".
Take your life between you and me.
And help others to breathe: show your interest and ask other things.
Asking questions leads to discussion and helps you to find people you love and people you wouldn't even talk to when you were in the air and these people would share the confusion.
Give me another room.
Their rooms often work as a gymnasium, a movie theater and as a general living room, but their own room is also a place where they can be played from basic materials.
More on the subject: Don't even imagine your co-ordination and university education
Introverts have a hard place at the university
However, in many homes there is a social culture in which room is chosen and living friendships are formed.
Such a culture can be an oppressive person who needs a place of return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say, "I want to keep you and our friendship going, but I want you to lose, so that I can get back to the energy I used to track with you."
Try to find out if any of your studies have started socializing with you. Kents would be happy to be free of the door and send the text instead.
I mean, I'm going to say, "I'm going to cut you off."
In my own student residence there was a guy who suddenly meant that he was healthy inside.
He saw everything.
Get your friends on the bed.
You start your teaching properly when you're in, so if you're going to have a brownie and you're going to knock on someone's door to influence the 50s, some strange case: "Come to the neighborhood, I'm going to give you a little sleep.
Housekeepers are a great way to get new friends.
Your student blood is required to talk to you. The amazing surprise may make them a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires you to be reasonable.
If you offer unsatisfying, sugary, and fatd chocolates, others likely make their bed when you go to the door.
Engaging in food is also a common problem in student housing.
Of course, taking the other side is stealing, but can you take the initiative to hide the treasure from someone else?
Always make sure you're the owner of the farm.
You'll probably get permission, even though the loan of the country would rob the owner of the job.
I understand very well that it is frustrating if someone is able to do something for you. However, try to handle your situation as mature as possible – other than your student, who threw his milk into the milk powder as a punishment for the dairy products.
She's in prison now.
Don't do it when others are trying to sleep or hang up.
It's not just because it's accurate, but it's also encouraging to remember that anyone who's dying for someone else...
In my own apartment, one girl asked a neighbor to set up music for less than three in the morning, and she had a tent in the morning.
The next time you've just added your voice capacity.
When I was late in the neighboring room, the girl gave me two hours to sleep in the closet, and she went into the tent for three hours, left the music in her room, and locked the door.
Would it not be Romantic if your future side had been forced to change the same area of residence?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your student blood was your future partner, you'd start arguing, you'd have to see him every day and lose the right of your fellow friends to meet him?
I mean, my heart wants what it wants, and if the study book isn't really the only one that's right, try to shut it down.
If you notice the moment of decision that someone has forgotten his opening to a room that has not been closed, the limit of competition and temptation is more urgent than you might think.
Good play is fun, but it's the one that's coming in right now.
To hide some of what has happened can be valuable and enjoyable teaching, but no one in the room likes to fight with a knife and a serpent.
The doors of another room can read and tap the windows into the water that makes the package, but do not touch any of the items on the roof a couple more times.
Foreign students' homes of racist uncle Kiteel - The house planned as a reception center was constructed in Salo
The home of foreign students was held on Monday morning in the Chinese district of Kite, North Karjala.
In other words, as the police said earlier, there are no housing arrangements for temporary asylum seekers, but more than ever the pensions of foreign students in Finland, according to Professor Heidi Luukkain of the National University of China.
The windows and walls of the National Holiday Styles were decorated with racist marks, as did the applicants, and one of the guesthouses had been removed from a metallic front, told the East Finland police.
According to Luukkas, a teacher of the social and social education of young people in the National University, the building was estimated at ten people during the summer.
"It was a weekend and mature people were free to move, so some could be different," Loukain says.
The National Court has hosted 12 people from different nationalities.
In Finland, they have been students for some time, as well as temporary asylum seekers who have been contacted.
All the buildings in the war are a-stamps.
Some students in adult education, some in vocational education and some students in Finnish," the Finnish newspaper.
The Statute A has been so stated as to grant a continuing residence permit that can be granted for four years once in Finland to a foreign country.
The East Suomen police were investigating the case as a crime scene and a murder of the house.
According to Luke, the students were held to be informed on the ground, where there was also a need for translation.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We've had twelve years of foreign students, and this is the first time when something like this happens," Luukian says.
According to the legend, the match has already been removed from the wall.
There were, of course, at least three men and they had been on the move in a car.
I think this is the theme of the youth weekend when this issue has now been on the surface.
It's nothing more serious," Loukain says.
A hospital has also been cleaned in Salo, which is covered by the reception centre.
The murder happened last week.
The issue was reported on the MTV website on paper.
The hospital wall was bordered by a searcher and written by his English "You are not welcome".
It's a crime report to the police.
Amendment 15.9. 16.02 Corrected police administrations for misinformation about the age and status of the people in the building.
The government will stop Y-yunna Karjaal - tourists near, "Idiottics of the world"
The Y-juna going to Karjaal from Helsinki will stop walking in March.
The news drew attention to the starting point of that June by means of the Helsinki capital investigation.
In particular, the bottom line is on the sandy ground, says Torbjörn Bengtström, a town in the state.
Idiots, because the number of people who live and work is growing all the time and need a fast and flexible relationship with Helsinki.
This can't be anything else than a political will or a lack of it.
Bengtström tells HSTV's interview video even if it comes to the capital of the tractor.
There are also other incidents in New Zealand.
The H- and R-cycles are re-connected as R-line.
The position of the syringe in Järvenpääs and Nuppulna Tuusula will be withdrawn from use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of Communications and the VR have published, as a paper, information on which the Ministry of Transport purchases a joint transport under the following contract.
The scope of the contract is changed in the year-by-year period and the routes to be stopped are throughout the country.
A new four-year agreement to be concluded will be adopted later by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström considers that the State party is short-lived.
We will make the same mistakes as we did before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there's a fall on the ground.
Y-turns also use other than rasesporians and censors, because it's fast and closes many positions.
From the Espoon Anna Pöyry, on June, the city area was affected by the longer term of travel.
"It's a bad name for those who have to plan their trip again," he said, putting it in Y-Y-Y.
It's a little easier.
There is a new link to the railway station, which replaces the Y-Jun in the Helsingin Seudung (HSL) region, i.e. to the Church number.
This will increase the costs for HSL, which is, in practice, for the citizens of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now able to identify different options and their impact on service and ticket prices," HSL deliverer Suvi Rihtniemi said.
Costs cannot yet be assessed properly.
The Board of Directors says that the HSL based on the number of passengers has paid out of the Y-turn for a million years, much more than that.
The next R line is to leave between two positions.
Instead, the number of unions in Ainolas and Saunacal is doubled.
All over the country, 28 small positions and numerous routes are left together.
The Ministry no longer buys a joint transport from the cars of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensu-Rīti will be reduced to the territory of Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
The railways are reduced by the cars of Rihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, the port of Kouvola-Katka and the Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year will be made in the months to be stopped when the total purchase of travel by the ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixth Korkman wrote in the book The Master's Journal: "Marx's Support for Family"
The world's economic crises have risen to the top of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and in 1867-1894, published in his final edition of Pejaman, writes in a book published today by Yrjö Hakan in the journal Marxin Päoman.
"They are now taken more seriously than for a long time," writes Hakan in his speech.
Marx's assessments of the development, internationalisation and deepening of the capital economy to all living areas, focusing on capital, as well as the growing role of capital and mental capital have been shown to be an amazingly remote region.
The author of the book based on the Master Seminars is also found by Professor of the Aalto University, a valued economic manager, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is a contemporary "now and forever".
However, is not the former Director of the Institute of Research and of the Government of Elkeine Life a Marxian?
Not really.
Korkman, in his phone call, says that he does not consider Marx to be a temporary economic worker but rather a more interesting community theory.
Social data have been specialized and specialized today, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and editor of literature.
"The usual thing is that history tells about the wrong attitudes of dead men," Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's prophecies went very slowly.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial coup, he drew far too close conclusions from the capitalist beginning.
But Korkman sees value in the radicalization of Marx.
"The most relevant thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again, we are discussing the aspects of Marxin's entertainment, such as the sharing of privacy.
"Marx may give inspiration to those who want to understand a great picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical imagination," Korkman analyzed.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is no help from Marx.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only end.
But Marx is supporting Korkman's idea of a family.
"In '70s Marxa couldn't read," Korkman says.
"Maolas and trotscals and others hated all capitalism, but still more to others."
Today's debate is more diverse, and Marxia can also come closer without the age of ideology and political stress.
"Every social worker should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," Korkman says.
UN requires military courts to judge Sri Lanka
The UN requires the establishment of a Special Court of Justice to investigate the armed conflicts in Sri Lanka, reports the AFP.
The United Nations report on the use of the internal market for 1983-2009 was published in the medium term after a long period of time.
The report blames the military forces, the Sri Lankan army and the military forces known as Tamilitikekre.
In Sri Lanka, at least 100,000 people are estimated dead.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, the large number of armed forces should be investigated in the last months of the war, as required by the UN report.
Sri Lanka’s troops reported charges of rape, rape, and systematic sexual violence, which were probably the same as men and women.
According to the report, the Captains have been charged with physical and child rape as combatants.
Both parties have been charged with the murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it was going to organize the investigation itself, but it is not going to be the seat of the United Nations Court of Justice, because foreign judges.
In English y-coke, socialist media can be targeted
In the Scriptures, the cross - references of the Sikhs included a long, English - speaking language in the central part of the empire.
The English sciences tested more than 16,000 cocals.
In the trial, the substance could be written on social media.
Based on my own experience, I wondered if social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
In an alternative way, the English word 150-250 could be used to refer to the Internet’s most popular form of advice.
The search was Dear Agony Anunt.
Agony Anut answers from the Finnish Leelian beauty.
He was asked how the parents should see things about young people as well.
Together, the subjects of the substance were four, one of which was to be selected.
"It was hard for them," considered the third theme of Porvoo's Swedish-language reading, by English-reader Mia Lybeck.
In the third case, only the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barrosol, had been appointed.
The fourth thing was very nice for Lybeck again.
It had to write a statement about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we're used to writing wood," Lybeck says and assessed the whole experience "as normal".
In the English trial, for example, questions were raised about the adaptation of summer camp to climate change and the treatment of large unknowns.
The average week was also written by some Russians (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
Syksy’s writings continue as a family, where there is a second household, either a meal or a Finnish examination.
In Luke’s account, trials are usually arranged, or the attitude of employees is not affected by them.
The University of the University of Applied Sciences calls on students to seek suitable travel in time so that they can pass on to the test.
Additional time can also be obtained if it can show that delay did not result from its own indifference.
In the village, the trade was stolen by a gun
In the village, they were robbed on Wednesday morning of trade in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the thief had been dragged into dark clothes and raised to hide in the command line.
A man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened his staff and received a small sum of money.
Let's look into the matter as a bunch of thefts.
Police are committed to reaching ten-year-old volunteers in Helsinki - support parties elsewhere from Finland
The opinion of the Board of Appeals in response to the rulings of the Government will be supported by the central family of Helsinki, predicting the police.
According to preliminary data, there may be even tens of thousands of people in the area.
The members of the SAK, Akavan and STTTK associations will meet at the railway station at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the opinion.
In addition to providing alerts and other police activities, the duty of the police in the workplace is to ensure that the waste is disposed of.
The roads leading to the railways are closed from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30-14 hours.
Only alerts are delivered to the area.
The journey from the direction of Hakanei to the direction of the river from the direction of the Mannerheim from the point of view of the river from the point of view of the sea.
Is there enough people in Helsinki's police station, Colonel Seppo Kujala?
Second, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand for the police's jobs.
According to the Helsinki Summit, for the sake of the opinion, support parties from Finland have come from other countries.
I don't want to tell the police about any significant party numbers.
"Some of the blood's coming, but we're usually going to do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police are urging us to avoid a private device in central Helsinki.
The figure estimates that the bad transport contract is being carried out at Hakanie's level at the nuclear center.
A steady movement is expected from the beginning of the morning.
On the other hand, there are a lot of bus buses in Helsinki, thanks to the volunteers who arrive from Finland.
They're not going to be delivered to the Routati Center.
The buses will be on their way.
Then you're going to have to go to a place of thought," Kujala tells you.
The state of mind will also stop the Helsing mission.
From the police point of view, there's a positive side.
The question of mobility of railways, which is normally addressed at these large gatherings, is now being addressed in part by itself.
The organizers of the opinion have informed the police that Helsinki may be the economic policy opponents of the ten thousand Government.
The police expect peace of mind.
Maybe they're normal employees or unemployed people.
The Finnishs are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
In different parts of Finland, local opinions are also organized as a family.
In many ways, the thought of the past is exceptional. Do you remember these laws and opinions?
In many ways, a great deal of thinking is interesting and exceptional.
For example, it does not find a very good comparison of Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskyl.
You don't have to be surprised that ay-game protest.
If it hadn't, it would have raised its hands in front of the government, Sisiengen would have said.
The very legitimate government has taken over the traditional aspects of Finnish corporateism - as well as those that have been important for the development of the Finnish State of well-being.
The hard-of-the-government authorities are not entitled to the contract.
There are a lot of limits to the fact that ay-games are really trying to get a gun.
The same is true of the ay movement. There's a place to look at the mirror.
The game, for example, is needed to ensure that the ay movement does not in any way have the support of all employers in the past for the opinion of the countries.
The new is now the division of the church, which the state of mind will have time for a group whose ay-mist would want to participate in the opinion.
The unemployment rate in Finland was estimated to be higher than in November 1993 at the national level.
If I looked for a comparison point for the country of thought, it could be the unemployment allowance, Murrostorsta, the German word for ‘Murrostorsta’ in 1993.
In the middle of a heart attack organized by Murrostorsta, a total of 20,000 workers were employed.
Esko Aho (center) government corrupts labour market crises on the other side.
It was said that Finland's government and employers' organizations had never been as bad as Aho's tax administration.
Now the government's and ay's movements may be even worse than Murrostor's times.
In addition, there is now a very serious vacuum management in Finland, Sisiengenen says.
The current Government College is still interested in the fact that it is such a strong legal basis despite the basics.
There were some elements of the old trade movement in the winter.
The place is expected to be surrounded by thousands of fans.
The state of mind also stops public transport and possibly closes daily homes and schools.
Even if the pensioner’s income is not shared by the employees, it can reach the highest age.
In Helsinki, there have been some 300 opinions for the last year.
They're on board.
Traditionally, in the Finnish ay movement, the ideals have been very peaceful, although they have been in action for the past few years.
Traditionally, in Finnish opinion, conflict is avoided, being legal.
The thinkers are trying to avoid the damage or destruction of property, Sisien's word.
By the end of the 1990s, however, new winds were brought.
The culture of thinking changed.
The EU's membership led farmers to throw the cannons and the police managed to get on top of it.
In 1998, the Palomies left for three months.
Also visible were aircraft and pilots.
Do you remember these laws and opinions?
Metals and electronics of the 1970s
The most significant lakes in the 1970s were metal lakes in 1971 and power and electricity in 1977.
A total of 70,000 metals were involved in the production of metals.
The Law was suspended by seven weeks during the presentation of the Soviet Union.
The metals received a 16 per cent wage increase.
In May 1977, the electrical power plant lasted 49 days and caused electric currents around the country.
Murrostorstai 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met to show their appreciation for work.
Palomen were living in three months in 1998
The palace was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless I was a national building.
Vulnerables against the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were protesting farmers against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia teaches, the EU stops," said one of the schools.
In Spain, farmers had to cut down tonne.
The 1999 Helsinki EU summit also enabled farmers to protest and burn raisins in front of the meeting place.
The caregivers settled 1983 and 1995
The hospital staff lived for about a month in 1995.
Last time they were married in 1983.
In 1995, a number of cases of deaths occurred during the construction period.
In 2007, I threatened to strike and arrest the guards.
The threat of mobilisation was finally triggered by the negotiations.
Doctors lactating 2001
"The Doctors of Law - the Challenge," said in 2001 the School of Doctors of Lawyers.
The number of public health centres and hospitals continued for five months, and it was time to discuss how the courts could threaten the safety of the patient.
After the act, the public sector has paid the doctors' wages.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students from the Helsinki Senate in 2013 for the March Study.
The Central Police will find the refugees fully aware of the Finnish Republic's conflicts with the Italian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Police to help in resolving the floods in the Finnish Register.
On Sunday, the Italian police stopped at Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
The file does not contain a list of possible routes to Finland.
Everything was good for you at the end of the line.
We've had an exchange of information with the Italian police.
The survey and the head office is in an event area in Eastern Italy, tells Major of Central Policy Tero Haapala.
By the end of August, the rest of the East German truck had become more and more vulnerable to passengers.
By the end of the day, all 71 passengers who had been in attendance were apparently killed in support.
In cooperation with the Italian police, according to the first report of the General Assembly, the race belongs to the Finnish department.
The company is operating, inter alia, a food industry, and its provider is an outsider, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested in the Eastern Hemisphere.
Hungry Captain, former drug dealer and former businessman - the story of the five conquistadores
A king of secretaries, a violent Russian, a typical messenger, and a very good to keep a taxi.
For example, such persons are subject to human trafficking in the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trent, and the supplier Giampaolo Musumec, have met and interviewed ten secretaries and their "owners" and, by writing their book, the Death Travel Office will express its opinion this week.
In the book they present man-made man-made products, make solutions, and present secretaries from different doors of business.
HS will present five of them.
I'll get rid of them right away.
The church files in Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there to a central location.
The islands are also particularly suitable for transport, since only 120 km from the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is a trip to the island of Lampedusa.
Because of comparison: the distance from Helsinki is about 85 km from Tallinn.
There, on El Attaya's roof, is Emir, my captain is burning in the kitchen and my father's six children.
Crekenna-shalts are famous for their shells, but the fisherman is more productive to drive people.
Emir's done it in blue, 10-metres of wood, hundreds of stories already.
If the Russian seal is full, it's possible for 40 people.
On one trip, Emir spends some 8 000 euros after costs.
Emirl has five supporters who are looking for her clients around Tunisia.
Customers have come from many countries, but during the Arab era, a large number of Tunisians wanted to put on an airway.
After that, the situation was calmed until the refugee crisis came to an end.
Customers get from Manter to Kerkena in small groups.
Emir will rent them to empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided in such a way that customers just stay alive.
The rent will pay about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer closes the money, it is their problem.
We're going to the water in the middle of a short walk.
The first night is taken away from the island, then stopped, waiting for the day and waiting for the next night for Lampedus.
Sometimes it's hard to catch, and passengers in 20 meters high below the ground will wake up and wake up.
The human body has been detached in an hour and Emir is leaving for the rest of the world.
Emir wants him to be scared.
As a result, she complains about her client and at least complains that she's a fan of ghosts.
He says in the letter that when the police chased him, he threw all his passengers across the boat and ordered these birds to be on the nearest island.
"I tried customers individually and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The quietest travelers will come from south of Sahara.
He's got to listen to his landman about this.
Let's get them out of here right away.
They need to know who's counting here right now.
The usual taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary Turkish in the Bogovadas of Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good. It's a start-up engine that's running the last time, and of course it's seen the best day of it.
However, it is important for Goran customers to move over the taxi and to move towards the borders of Hungary.
Bogovavata is a small town about 500 miles [60 km] south of Belgrade.
The centre for asylum seekers is located next door, mainly in the family.
In the middle of the surrounding forest without family members, men travel to live in tents, in large and abandoned cars, now that everyone has been able to find or build.
There are also families in the village who have not left their asylum application in Serbia for reasons or for others.
Some also rent private property, but it's a public secret.
Goran's team will find most of their customers.
These are often overcrowded - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weekly journeys in a difficult landscape, often in coastal areas and in the dark.
When we finally reach the Bogovád region, the great point of human civilization, people are dying.
Gorans are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis, and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he's telling in the book.
"They say their thing once and it's enough," Goran complains.
He says the Africans are trying hard.
Goran doesn't like it.
The hall heard the whole trip.
For example, the price of EUR 300 is agreed first, then they count it to 200 and they offer it at the end of 150.
Goran highlights her beauty and approval of a man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells him to do his job better than others and to pay for his request to the Hungarian border of only EUR 50.
The trip is three hundred miles [3 km], most of it is comfortable with motor vehicles.
The colleagues will ask for a third or fourth price.
Goran owes about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a large amount for the consignor, but it's a very nice anniversary in Serbia.
Serbia has determined that the taxis cannot move to a transferable distance of 12 kilometers closer to the border of Hungary.
Goran doesn't care: he's aware of the roads and the trains and he's taking his towels from the top of his head.
Then he shows the customers the right direction and throws them away.
In the work of the board
From 35 years of age, a Congolese is called a Messenger, and it is not just a favorite name.
In fact, he has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where many of Congo’s prisoners of faith are being put on hold, as well as a small center where the Congolese children are being helped.
In addition to the mission, the Ambassador will turn on a secret transport bus that will move people from Congo to Europe.
He's looking for a job to do.
It's important for the transmitter to look good.
He has many times a day to relax, and I have to be careful that white cholera’s cornea is thoroughly dried by the cold of the cholera.
The transmitter is proud of his new Mercedes, his farming car, and his three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and ahead of Europe.
The person will call on the board from the address of a number of five of the senders.
He suggests that the border should be maintained in the morning, keep the money clearly hidden, and keep the border on the side of the traffickers on the way.
In order to obtain a asylum seeker or a refugee status, Ugandan authorities must be informed that there is a home for example in North Kivun war areas and that there has been a need to reduce domestic violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Publisher will arrange a new identity for the client.
Old personality certificates will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
That's where they help the Ambassador's contacts in Ugandan police.
Thereafter, the customer is guided to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum application, the creation of civil organisations, finally the UN refugee organization at UNHCR.
The sender feels bureaucracy because he has come to Uganda as a refugee.
It pays for each step separately: leaving an application to the Ugandan police will pay about a hundred euros, treating documents to the humanitarian organization about 150 and changing the process, for example, to a European country of EUR 4,500-7 000.
Follies and ice creams
Tom's the starter of the secret driver, the former junkie.
A four-year-old Irish daily on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to let people go to the streets on the way to Britain.
He has a young Afghan, French taxi driver and ten trainers who do not even know that he is in the passenger bus.
At night, Tom and the cabman arrived at their client, usually from 2-3 people, some of which were sent from Calais.
They're driving A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop by the car, Tom and the driver would have to arrange for an illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want it. He's been sitting for seven years because of the noises.
To stop it, Tom is driving the customer's motor over to a quiet place where some people sleep before they continue to leave the canal to Brittany.
Tom's choosing a suitable race, he must make sure it's on his way to England and not even to the Netherlands, and he's gonna take off the security guard.
It's gotta be quiet so you can wake up.
Sometimes something's in there, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom turns his client on aluminium foil, the same as that which is drawn in the kitchen around the kitchen or around the kitchen.
It should prevent the police from detecting the hideouts.
Some use the same amount of salt for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client on the street and leaves the place hope that no one will stop the suspects at least before Britain.
King of the Salaculators
Muammer Little is one of the world's most famous human artists.
The Turkish people have been called the master of the market and the king of the illegal trade in the Netherlands, which governs the maritime routes from Turkey to the EU, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, the small has been operating and has continuously developed new secretive methods.
He also has a competitive view of other entrepreneurs: he demands money at home.
One of the new methods is the literacy rate: Turkey's hundreds of tourists are being recruited, including United States or European families, for a few days.
In fact, ships are directly loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transporting EUR 5 000-7 000 against payment from the first Istanbul country to port and from there to Europe.
Customers are kept in human stocks, for example in old industrial offices, until they are gone.
People are locked in minibuses, and they're going somewhere on the beach.
They are ordered secretly in a group of growth and are expected to be marked.
When it is given, it must be lifted fast.
Travellers must stop the entire trip under cover.
The Navy can only look at how deep the ship is, because other signs of the human race are not visible.
Food and drink will be provided, but the less the passengers grow and grow, the better.
The small will receive about EUR 53 000 from one non-industrial cost.
He does not care for practical things himself but pays the captain, the colours, the guards, the landlords, and other minors to handle the work on his behalf.
There are at least hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of millions of traffic in the south.
It is estimated that through secret companies, the country, the medical company, and over a hundred homes that she rents.
Muammer Kücük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a national representative of the Democratic Party of Turkey and a medical partner.
After that, he's apparently gone.
16.9.2015 at 15.10 a.m.: The death marchbook will appear here, not in the first week.
American Olympics tell their book about their disease and their departure as a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, a 500 - foot - long [150 m] jockey Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has raised its attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton is writing on the name of Fast Girl about ending her urine and thinking of being a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated page would publish a series of books on paper.
Favor Hamilton decided his career in Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the kisses at the funeral and to drink at the casinos for the second time.
But in the finals, he went into panic.
He immediately broke into the corner and broke his lead on the ground.
However, 150 meters before the mine, his power disappeared.
He fell on the edge of the row, and other competitors stopped him after each other.
I felt like I was an idiot, and I thought I'd never walk again.
But I threw myself over the painting, and Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a two-hundred male cancer.
His brother Dan had committed suicide years before Sydney had committed suicide, and he himself experienced great success.
Favor Hamilton was 43 years old when he ran into a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The Parisian society had no economic problems, but she was reluctant to get money from having sex with other men.
She also spoke to her husband to approve of her actions.
Favor Hamilton's tax was 450 euros per hour.
He's telling me he's using the money to make a living.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton’s career as a prostitute was that he was like the same adrenaline stores as he had received in a competition in a public hospital.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had two hundred men.
The two of the first highlights appeared at the end of 2012 when Smocking Gun was published in his article.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1,500 feet [3,57,40 m] in the world statistics, but he remained in the Olympics in Sydney.
When I joined the Norwegian Air Force, you said, "Suroralemans"
King Petter Northug of Norway has exceeded the scope of at least one of his colleagues' opinions.
Northug and Norway's hieroglyphics have been calling for the last year's time and effort in the field of sports.
Although the association has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been announced to the world's leaders and the Olympics.
As a result of the Treaty, the Norwegian hieroglyphics decided to close Northug's future world Cup.
The decision was thanked by two world champions Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy to join me in the hijacking.
"Thank you for showing me a little light," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We can't afford to sell that one activist can avoid working for the Union sponsor," he continued.
There is a financial gap between the Norwegian hieroglycities and Northugs.
Northug would obviously want to be a part of the country team so that he could report his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said that he was happy when he represented an association that also cared for future generations, and did not give one of the players in the games.
At the same time, he recalled that the association has given Northug both economic and other special rights for many years.
I know it because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one player has a very different set of rules than just because it's the best one.
Northug would publish his own report, which assured him that he wanted to play in Norway’s colors first across the globe and then in MM-kissies and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won all six MM missions, two of them gold.
He was with him in the last winter of Falun in the winning team.
The day of the contest for the refugees is also held in Northern Ireland
On the 25th of July, there will be a series of exhibitions in various restaurants and shops for which Paistingers have been awarded a competition.
The aim of the day is to highlight the high level of the Finnish food sector and lower the level of departure from the restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the cold as a high quality.
It is also to be recalled that not all high-quality restaurants have been focused on the capital city, but the checks and classifications of the independent operator are found around Finland.
The international attention to the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of competition companies and organisations.
In the northern part of the day, there will be a restaurant in Vaasa in the Fund and in the Cantarlic.
The day of the contest at Kokkokola is part of a restaurant in Vanhan City.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has also been decided to make one of the most important international events organized by the organization during the same day across the world.
Finland continues to be a country of origin.
Letter from the Ombudsman: Establishment of a Criminal Response Centre to legal tenders
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are currently owned by the LSK Business Park Oy, in cooperation with the LSK Office for Foreign Affairs.
According to the claim, there is still a critical infrastructure for the crisisr, which is the defence forces and its partner partner, Finland's Erillsverkot Oy.
The complainant's letter states that the establishment of the response centre in the same construction environment would constitute a significant safety risk which is not taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the Chancellor, the defence forces may have the interests associated with the former Air Force School and the airport, which have not yet been identified in the preparation of the response centre.
The report states that negotiations have been held for the past two years with regard to the rural area and the result of the possible flight to the airport by an external operator.
The issue has been discussed, inter alia, by Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistung (ps.) and national administrator of the Ministry of Defence with Arto Rädy.
A private entity shall ensure that there is no question of the principle of the response of the reception centre, but that the planned location in the previous reserve area is wrong.
In the last few days, the city administration has dealt with the response centres.
Nationality: The Syrian situation is due to Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The Government means that there are necessary conditions for farmers and those in this area, when the rapporteurs of all the representatives of the Republic of Montenegro are officially elected by the Presidents of the Republic of Montenegro.
According to the President, all participants were concerned about the management of the refugee population.
He considers it valuable that the government and opposition parties in Finland have been able to discuss the fundamental issues confidently.
Especially in this time when we have great problems ahead of us
According to the report, the situation in Syria as well as in Russia and the United States can also have an impact on Ukraine and beyond the situation in the Baltic.
It is effective in the development of dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it has an impact on the situation of Ukraine and continues to be a threat to the Baltic Sea situation.
According to the report, the Nato issue was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the situation in the labour market.
Finnair spent 16 years on a private plane, Alkot stayed for a couple of hours
One flight is already being started as a tortoise and 15 tours.
A list of flights from Finnair's website is available.
In Finland, it is said that the operations of airports are aimed at maintaining a dominant position during the labour market.
However, suicides and delays are expected for security checks and other services.
The message of hope closes the minds of Helsinki
As a family, the spirit of reasoning will close the minds of Helsing.
The police tell the Routati Center to shut down the cars at 9.30 a.m.-14.
Cars are not rescued from the design of manners, postal and labour services to the railway station.
The Union's transport plan for Hakanian will be guided by the Union's Roadmap in the direction of the Kaisani railway.
According to the police, the time of closure depends on the number of violence involved.
Only warning vehicles will be delivered to the area.
Metro- and ratiod circuits throughout the whole country of thought
Metro and railway transporters participate throughout the period from the start of the night service to the end of the night.
The association of railway and metro personnel reported on this matter to the STT on the night of the night.
The Kingdom of Alko is closed for two hours, including the post closures
A family’s mental inclination also causes problems with Post services.
Significant delays are expected, inter alia, for day-to-day distribution.
Part of the mail services are closed.
The blood transfusions of the Finnish Red Cross are treated without charge.
It is also intended to treat atriums, hospitals and laboratory services.
The status information for the services will be obtained from the Posts website.
Most of Finland's Alkoa closes its doors for two hours as a family.
The Pamp Service Professional Association has instructed its employees to stop work between 11: and 13:00.
Pam has also invited day-to-day trade workers to participate in the opinion of professional organisations.
The representatives of the SOK and of the Central Bank point out to Helsinki Saomim that the sellers are trying to keep open when necessary.
According to the Commission, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual goods.
The Helsinki daily house is partially closed
Helsing's daily homes do not work as a whole throughout the year, reports the Helsinki Office of the Old Age.
Due to the opinion of professional organisations, day care may be focused on certain days and not on the organisation of day-to-day and recreational activities.
Environmental surveys of day-to-day and developmental and multi-child groups remain open.
In addition, the evening work of developing and assisting students is organised normally.
The Agency shall allow information on the changes in operations to be made tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Stop taking a real risk
According to Sipila, there is a need for multiple channels, and the Prime Minister's TV and radio talks are one of the channels in other groups.
We also need to continue the canal of this kind of honest speech.
This won't be the last time, Sipila told the suppliers in the community.
Sip still did not want to assess how often the return of the Prime Minister's TV and radio talks are coming.
According to the sip, there is no need to keep your conversations on the Ylen channel.
If other channels are reported to be canava, they'll be seen then.
Now we're using this canal tonight, Sipila said.
According to Sipler, the state of the economy in Finland is so serious that it requires citizens to be kept on television and radio.
This matter, which is now discussed, is a time of diversity and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up on this channel.
The call will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Arena.
Stop taking a real risk.
The media researcher hopes that Cyprus will not tell you more about turning into the government.
Is it an attempt to adopt the definition of the public debate more clearly in its own hands and to reject the issues of the public debate? Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Tukhola.
I would like to point out that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) has made a late comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not give it a definition of himself.
I hope, on behalf of the democratic debate and the public, that these matters will not relate to each other.
I understand that the commercial media has been attracted to the Sip’s announcement.
It would be weird if the media hadn't responded.
The political decision-makers' communications requirements are not a matter of democracy.
The role of media representatives is definitely an attempt to avoid the adoption of political agendas.
According to the experience, the TV conversation is a big risk to Sipilje.
In our speech, we should bring something new and special in order to meet the extraordinary high expectations set out in the speaker.
Are we offering today more than we've heard?
Or can he speak in a different way, in a different way, or in a different way, or say something new?
I would like to say that if there is only one more age, I must wonder why such a great victory was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In general, this risk will be taken into account if there is no special situation but routine talk in other groups.
The danger is that the Supreme is bound by communications from politicians or society and government, which is certainly not in line with the interests of the Ylen or the general line.
A silhouette glass glass
It is also important in the future in the future that what the Prime Minister has to say should be stressed by the media researcher.
In the morning, we will see exactly what Sip is missing and what isn't, says Dr. Heikki Kuuttti, director of the University of Jyväskyl.
I heard a TV talk is coming from the village of Sipil, because this is how it gets to the point of its own view without the time of the season.
Such a message is received by a large audience without a journalist's consent, other than in the media, where suppliers can pose critical questions.
The sword will stop the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media will translate the language into something wrong, because it is not able to raise specific questions.
I've heard that it's very important how the Sip is on TV, the pain of the wound, the release of the hands.
He's going to be a Sipilian, who's telling the people what to do.
If Sip is able to make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government would know something about it, because this person's age is like talking directly to another person.
Such (United States President Barack) Obama and the partners are regularly celebrating.
Really exceptional
Politician researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to citizens to be very exceptional.
He said it hasn't happened in ten years that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the nation.
An exceptional time requires exceptional ways, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like to make the Finnish citizens welcome.
Retirement organisations are organized on a regular basis against the activities of the government.
In Twitter, President of the left-hand side, Mr Arrhimäki says that Sipila could keep her speech on the status of the nation in the presidency as a statement by the Prime Minister, who would also be able to discuss the speech.
SDP President Antti Rinne (Sd.) also announces his concern about the Siplia dialogue.
There's no time for monologues right now.
I've been in trouble for a little half a year.
The finals can't be hidden, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy with a necktie has been found in Tampere.
The boy was right at the time of his discovery.
A boy, one of his friends and friends, his father updated his Facebook page.
The Central Finland police station will also confirm the matter for the night.
The boy went out for four hours at night.
Later tonight, she's lost contact with him.
My father thanks all the people who are looking for him.
Thank you for the ten contacts and discovery during these hours.
The update was distributed almost 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC hits young people into violence: You get angry
A Kurdish liberator, Makwan Amirkhan, would publish a video on Facebook, which is particularly encouraging to young immigrants.
Makwan America was under pressure to speak against the young people's attacks.
Amerkhani, born in Iran and with his family in Finland at the age of five, has won both of his professions in the most valuable UFC series of free trades.
Amirkhani tells me that he received a message asking to see one of the Instagrams.
There are videos on the table where young people are killed by extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's a little confused about young people's vulnerabilities.
The 26-year-old American has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The rest of the country, sitting on the other side of the street, sitting face-to-face without thinking about any of the consequences of this, when you do exactly the right videos, American days.
Hard to deal with.
Some of the young people seen in the video are immigrants.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, the social media has posted video clips on both immigrants and young people in prison.
I'll call it that you're killing your superiors by the way.
You make so many other immigrants' lives more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish American remembers.
I remember that in Finland there are websites that are looking for the crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very common.
It's a little hard, boys. Let's talk about you guys.
You should remember that you're still on your way to the country, and you're gonna be here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, American says.
Amirkhan invites young people to remember their neighbors.
If they sometimes get into trouble with someone more racially, then you can blame yourself.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, you'll stay.
Amirkhan says violent action is contributing to racism.
You're gonna get a bit of a hate I don't like myself.
You have, of course, bad times, and that's why you're not going to get any better, I'm going to decide.
SAK put its position in the storage package - Lyly: decisions on land
SAK's president, Lauri Lyly, tells Twitter that the employer's organization is based on its country's position to submit an alternative inventory.
Lauri Lyly commented on the proposal made by STTTK on Twitter.
STTK told the government that it had made its own proposal last Wednesday, which Prime Minister Juha Sipil (meaning) asked for a five-percent period of productivity.
Akava's president, Sture Fäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it required that the largest employers' organization SAK be strengthened in its previous position.
SAK's president, Lauri Lyly, made a comment on this issue on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK's work committee is dealing with this matter as a country.
According to Lylyn, SAK sought solutions to "opening the labour market" and that the replacement of requests would require contracts made by active parties.
Lyly recalls that the proposal by the Prime Minister of the Government of Cyprus as a Community agreement did not apply to SAK.
The previous negotiations on a Community agreement would be closed when SAK did not agree to commit itself to the objective of the five per cent productivity class.
Comment: The big message is threatening to come up - "I feel it's a little bit boring to keep the trees out of the way"
It feels a little bit like a wooden tree, if there's already a toilet paper, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The tunnels vary from position to position in the employer's office.
Does it mean to call a government on a team or even agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's allies cleansed the area of hatred against the government.
All of Finland was threatened.
This publication is not for sale.
The Teachers' Professional Organization, OAJ, threatened to shut down schools and day-to-day homes.
As a smoker, OAJ retired: no school or daily home is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the STTK's chairman, Antti Palola (sd), presented itself in agreement.
She told her Government that she was in contact with the government and that she had created Prime Minister Juha Sipilė (meaning) to ask for five per cent of the options presented for the period of productivity.
Akakava's president, Sture Fäder (kok), hurriedly announced that his agreement was ready.
The SAK's office did not begin to be covered.
President Lauri Lyly (sd) is difficult to deal with when the federal presidents ordered us to stay on the ground as a family.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK's Employment Committee will meet on the first day of the month to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to "opening the labour market".
In order to create a common representation of employers, the SAK should also adopt a five-percent period of productivity objective.
It is no wonder that Palola STTTK has a good relationship with the Government of Cyprus.
Mr Juka Ihanus, Head of Social Action of the STTK, has previously acted as the Special Representative of Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinie.
It is also true that the government's ay-sharing has improved all the time.
Whether or not, but Palola's exit took a little clean away from Finland's residents, whose music played against Akt's Marko Piraiinen (sd).
It's a little bit of a mess, if there's a toilet paper in the kitchen.
Custom time 18.00: Add information about Lylyn comments.
The Russians cried Finland's worst father: "This can't be repeated"
Russian Duum President Sergei Naryshkin criticized the Helsinki Etyj meeting.
In the opinion of Russian Duum President Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Estonia than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator has begun the hearing of the Etyin Parliamentary Assembly, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki Jewish meeting.
At the time, Finland did not allow the Russian policies of the European Union's candidate, such as Naryshkin, to be reached at a meeting - a matter which the President was discussing to remind the suppliers.
In our view, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This can't be repeated, Naryshkin stressed the press office with Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, the Naryshkin’s criticism was addressed to the United States, where it had also been banned.
The sanctions are political suicides from the EU, Naryshkin's newspaper.
The delegation of Mongolia of Russia came to the fore, so Naryshki continued to extend Finland's migration by accommodating and thanking Mongolia for its "aeronautical organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will be a constructive and positive outcome, but rather than a meeting held in Helsinki in July.
Mongolia's leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue does not have to be prevented.
Naryshkin has met with the Ulan Bator meeting, led by Ilkka Kanervan (kok), who has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
Closes the real playoff game: "Malitas in the dark"
The Tappara and Luke continue today in Hakamet, when both will be on the second day of the rebirth.
Janne Lahti predicted that today there will not be any old land management in Hakamet.
Tappara went to Kuopios last night to the 3-2-year-old KalPas.
The rose was a man, for the last time the chopper group was at least two days away from the killing site.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The Romanian island of the island of Blues, which began suddenly, was surrounded by zero points, and the killings were 2-3 years old.
A tough game, the ground in the dark, if any play the same game as last year, the Lukko-rektor Janne Lahti predicted the setups on the side of the track.
The killer has been designed for peaceful little playoff.
The Tappara is named in two previous ways just in the middle of Luko's finery.
In both cases, the solution has been required for seven solutions.
In the last distance, Luke takes the cross to the square in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three steps and ends.
There are no major changes in the groups' meetings, except for the number of groups.
The killers who fought both of them yesterday will be killed today.
At the battleground, Mika Noronen makes a place for Tom Karhuss, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View: This is a hard display to start.
President Toivola wrote a letter to the chief executive of the Rautakaloli, who was unable to continue, by Santtu Silvennoine Tampere.
It's classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film, where he himself showed his head.
The mayor sat down to the world champion Apollo Creed in a sedentary camp.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost the title class.
Three and a half years after Rocky's first daughter, Mika Toivola, wrote her hand on a free motorcycle in Pori.
The name-and-the-fashioned package led me to surprise all of the 2006 SM finals.
The group was full of names such as Rocky, but it's a bunch of bad guys.
It was from the White Indians, Porn Mattia and Pele.
The players in the boxing game were coloring their head red and cutting the puzzles.
I'd like to be a blond.
The manio TV player JP Jalo called the manufacturer Neamani.
These guys took a winning hope.
The hope was one of the saints.
The author, Mr Toivola, believes that the reform process will work the same way ten years ago.
The man who works as a performer of these sports events has built a house for bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have gone away like Rocky's son-in-law.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparesen's debts are somewhere else than in classical play.
The hope has been forgotten that Rocky VI is the head of Pekka Routakallio.
Karri Kavi has been criticised by Routkallion Sean Connery.
Routakallio is one of the most famous representatives in the Rockys, which Connery would have been at the beginning of 1976.
There's nothing like Rocky's name.
The philosophy of the Red Callium is not part of the cross-sectional and smallness of the game.
He appreciates a lot of games, but it's different things to play a lot harder than a dog.
Last time I saw Garret Stafford, he sent Tapparan Jere from Karjala to the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judge, but Routakallio put a man on the couch.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't accept such a game, and it doesn't belong to a short-distance six-year-old Routakallio after the game to the Satakunna Nation.
This way, the team has been well built.
They're June, vets, cops, and detectives.
There are no key players in the best game.
It's not surprising that the headmaster's been wrong with his ideas.
How much have you been able to influence the players, Pekka Routakallio?
The recent events that affected procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market were slow, with the diplomatic response of Routakallio.
I'm going down the street.
In 1953, Rautakallio was obviously interested in moving to Toivola to a sports stadium.
Men's contracts end in winter.
There are a number of killings on the ground from 1 to 6.
The hope should not have been supported by a continuous letter of resignation.
Olga Temonen shows Sipe Santabuk's mother
Olga Temone reveals that if she had met her husband as a teenager, they would have had nothing to do with him.
Olga Temonen appears for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm going to find my husband's mother.
Of course, it feels crazy, a sample and a producer of Olga Temon's joke.
He has been married to the Apulanan ex-baser and leader Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The Parisian society has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is the first time shown under Tuuka's leadership.
In the beginning of the years of Apollanna, you made us in a beautiful picture of Sippa Santa Puku's mother, Sirkka.
The circus is growing and supporting her son, even though this father, Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann), is trying to keep his voice shut.
The more I know about my real destination in the circus, the easier it feels to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuk that he trusted me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the two of them were much closer.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone, they've got messages.
The circus has really helped a lot.
We've used a lot of different hills throughout their history.
The circus also appreciates that the drama is a drama and that the truth may have a little color.
Olga points out that Sirkka was near Heinala, the only one who sincerely believed that Aplanna would come from Finland's largest band.
At the age of 90, there was a lot of noise and a real challenge.
There was a little chance that someone was really successful, but Sirka had something intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about this youth before the film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have been slightly different.
So, if you're 15 years old, as many parents really know what you're up to.
Olga reveals that her youth was completely different from the wicked Tuuka known as a traitor of Heinola.
Olga was an archipelago and a nice girl who had no film with Tuuka to do anything.
At least he could've kept a secret.
According to Olga, he has worked so much for ten years with Tuuka that a large joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always got great.
Now the whole producer group goes to Heinola for months.
In fact, the Parisian society in the past actually intends to spend time with its little children, often also at home, because the gap is not too long.
We've been ruling for the whole month of Heinala.
They've taken us really warm against us, they've just asked what we're going to do and when we're going to be wiped out.
Iron Sky 2 rose to Finland as the largest model
Timo Vuorensola led by Iron Sky: The Coming Race budget is EUR 17 million.
Pictures begin in October in Belgium.
The watchman Timo Vorensola is starting to depict Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Iron Skyn's scaffolding section, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will raise Finland's largest sample of all times in the EUR 17 million budget.
Previously, the title of Finland's most famous movie had been at the Jalmar Helmar Helander Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after the completion of Iron Sky 2: as the video budget is over EUR 100 million.
The descriptions of the film produced by Timo Vueresola and Tero Farkoma begin in October near Antwerp near AED Studios and last for eight weeks.
The overseer of Timo Vuorensola is leaving Belgium for the first week.
I'm not afraid of leaving the budget.
I've been in a very sick ride!
I'm so glad to have the file on the manuscript, because I know exactly what the ceiling should be.
Everyone in the working group feels that they're doing something unexpected.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though it's time, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to see that I'm going to show up at the general of this Leff, he's telling me at night.
The budget of the original film was estimated at 8-10 million, but the budget also grew in the development of the manuscript.
It's a big budget, but it's a big store.
However, the film would be worth 100 million, as each picture and performance is so expensive.
Now everything's turned so tight that there's no way out.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a group-funding campaign and a group campaign on Wednesday, which will pay 4-8 per cent annual fee.
The final peak shall be determined according to demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay back.
The performance picture includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Join or cool?
Isoto logos return to places
In recent times, trends have taken over the ice logos.
Once again, a well-designed sticker avoided clear and large logos such as Crocsey's consagna.
The mention of the Huppar or t-position mark was found to be in any joint.
It's only time that's changed.
Sports has become a true form of megatrendo, and so do the old, familiar sportsmotors, such as Adidas and Nike, have risen to the bottom of the college.
And as often as before, the limit is noticeable: if there's a right band, it's going to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core train, i.e. a pattern where the trends surprised the most likely weak basics of age than a way to distinguish from the mass.
Now put on a hard base collegiate instead of the hard core, it's already on the bottom of the cap, which is in front of the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and the better, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, the Adidas are identified by the railway networks, the football team, and the New York Yankees leagues have made a return to the castle.
The Calvin Klein logos of the beginners are now cool details.
The trend also appears to be in the transfer of sports brands to the luxury brands.
For example, the circumference of Versace sysmorrhages makes it clear what this is about.
Would you be willing to present your logos to you?
Russia's policy would give evidence: I haven't been able to sing for hours in the army!
According to the findings, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russian Arms Expo 2015 was considered to be a product of the Russian military industry.
In the last days, Russia's media has published colourful allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to withdraw large churches from the presence of Serbia's tank for five hours.
In the meantime, he's done everything he can to get information.
He would even publish on his own Facebook page a picture that shows that he's going to squeezing the body of the panserion in very good hours and at least on the basis of their images, it's nothing to be ashamed of or able to do.
I'm a full-fledged lady.
Let's start by saying that I didn't go into the fight fund, but it was the BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier, the superintendent, I've served in Ural.
I went in there, I looked around and came out peacefully, Sorov told the Communists of Pravda.
I wasn't Jewish, and I didn't really spend five hours in that apartment, he said.
The Russian army's TV channel, Xorov, explained his admiration for Russia's new technology because he himself is a former professional.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the cars, and I liked our technique.
And I came out through the backyard, he said.
I went through all the tanks.
And in the next show, I'm going to go to all the tanks and all the sidewalks, you promised.
Sozoov also complained about writing as a typewriter.
One type was written, and all the others were coming back.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and slow, but no matter what I've ever been to the tank, it didn't happen, he told Russia's servant to the novoste radio.
Zozov's words support that no photograph of the alleged suicide has been published, even though the shooting took some 50,000 people for a few days.
From the incident of Zozov, the movement started with the Bloknot.ru site, where Zozov was told about the explosions of tanks out trying and eventually threatened to shoot all around, unless he got out of the surface.
Later, the Blocnot website would be published, where the exhibition organizers told about what had happened.
Everyone's just used to get soldiers to get out of the truck quickly.
But the ruler of the people, Dozov, who was brought up from his father's house, simply disappeared when he came out.
But he didn't even sit there for five hours, said a demonstration coordinator, Alexander Pisarevski, to the block.
Here's the favorite of the integration bloggers.

The Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland in Kittlän has suffered a fall for the year.
The purified process water of the crop has been so called from the spring of the wheat harvest.
According to the company, measures to fix the year have been initiated.
The sample contains a sample of the process of neutralising the flow of rice and purified process water.
In general, water is pumped either to be used to re-use process fluids or to be carried through the environment by means of a surface environment, according to the licence.
The year was estimated to be about 300 miles per hour [300 km / hr] when it was discovered.
According to the company, the quality of annual water meets the current commitments.
No other substance affected the environment.
The year was found to be due to the inspection period on Monday morning.
The year has not been found to cause structural damage to the floor structures.
The company shall report on close cooperation with the authorities in order to monitor and improve the situation.
The plan is to employ about six reliable workers.
Denmark Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against playing too much
The Finnish country report published by the International Monetary Fund of the IMF today follows closely the views of the Government and the Ministry of State of Finance.
The Commission took steps to address the structural reforms covered by Finland in order to address economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overcrowding and free-of-charges would support Finland’s competitiveness.
The reform would require the entire treaty system as well as the safety of unemployment.
According to the Danish Bank's leading economist Pasi Kuoppamä, structural reforms are of the same opinion, but there are small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of useful messages from the government, but on the other hand, there are also warnings about what should not be done too much.
These are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamek tells Talosusnamom.
Growth projects should also support the IMF's idea to implement as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF predicted that this year's 0.4% growth, which will be reduced first year by 0.9%.
Today, Denmark predicts that in the new trend, growth will remain for zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic than this year.
They may have been the last ones to find out.
This morning the Statistics Centre told the total production to be in the middle of a small growth, Kuoppamäki is real.
The weakest confidence of industry or other so-called weaker measurements has been able to draw less attention again.
However, the issue is only a few percent of the decimals.
A new leader named Nintendo, a dying man.
In July, working under the heading of Satoru Iwata, Tatsumi Kimishima began working on her midweek work, Nintendo told her about her day.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002, and she was recommended and a charismatic growth in the field.
Iwata, for example, successfully responded to the Wii console's launch.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishman is not surprising.
He was one of those who were raised to represent Iwata as possible followers.
Kimishima is a safe choice for Iwata's haircuts, an Ace Research analyst for the Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see the removal of Nintendo by means of mobile games, but so that it does not feed the company's grip on traditional toys.
Finland will be able to obtain more and more temporary asylum seekers
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Office recognized that even hundreds of children who have come to the country are missing annually.
This has been reported, inter alia, by the Swedish Immigration Office, on the website of the SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, to eliminate hundreds of minor applicants per year.
The Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will tell the country what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Do you have the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants are missing under this year? - In Finland, 156 were granted a temporary asylum application in 2013 alone.
You lost 9 of them.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11 were lost in Candelma.
It may be that in dealing with the matter, the applicant is already registered in another country in which the Dublin Regulation applies and may have been found to be complete.
In this case, the applicant may be more inclined to lose than to continue to deal with the matter in Finland and to return to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014 the asylum seekers in Finland were all 3651, of whom 134 were granted an appeal because the applicant had probably changed from Finland, so the adult asylum seekers lost 123 over the last year, he says.
Is there a lot of growth?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for temporary asylum alone.
The total number of asylum seekers lost this year is not yet available, but the number of asylum seekers is then known and it has grown clearly, which is likely also affecting the number of missing persons, and it is stressed.
How is the translation decision going to be?
Are they also missing, for example, the black labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because the implementation of the reverse decisions is in the hands of the police, which is stressed by the Cannela.
Interior Minister Petter Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered attemptors in the country.
He's been running out of action.
At the EU internal ministerial meeting, Orpo reported on the practical activities on the ground where the power of asylum seekers can be managed by Sweden through Sweden.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices
The sale is now under way by the sales of Timo T.A. Mikkosen TV and radio production, which has been lost in the area due to illness.
For the part of Mikkos, Nina Mikkonen sells Huuto.net devices that were currently the most advanced of professional tools.
The net notification was the first website to tell about my nightkamasis.
Today, much of the equipment has remained at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam diseases are no longer described.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interest will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer modern, but these are also needed as long as there is an existing substance of an old generation that must be digitalized.
On the other hand, there are a lot of contractors and the construction of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen's back to the IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to change their current home in Myrskylän.
We can't take everything with us.
I've started an inventory, and I've started to see what kind of goods they're creating.
This is what I'm starting to say, Nina Mikkone.
There's no use for TV and radio devices anymore.
It is clear from the consequences of brain damage that a man has not done a long time ago to get back to work.
Nina Mikkone notes that now we only sell goods and equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's early life was already archived in the middle of the National Audiovisual Institute, where representatives went on film trading and other material from Myrskylä.
The danger of traffic being threatened is worse: Metro and rail can be stopped as a whole
Metron and railway transporters today decide whether to expand their activities across the country of thought.
The original plan was to establish a time limit for the transport of metro and bicycles by the spring.
In the morning, you decide if you stop your traffic all day.
Mr Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great in the field.
Night and day breaks are bad for drivers, so the government's plans to cut the bonds will raise the challenge.
However, it is not clear that the establishment of transport throughout the day is a dilemma.
If the metro and the railway are set up as a family, the public transport is practically stopped by the capital city.
According to VR, the birds do not fly during the spring between morning and evening.
As a family, they're not moving close to you, they're not moving around.
The boys who left before the morning will be taken to the deadlines.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses remain on the west coast.
The members of the AKT are away from work on Friday morning at three o'clock in the morning.
Probably a small amount of buses can be timed, they will be considered as primary power, the reporter of HSL Pirkko Repo calculates.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly what bus routes are going through.
Retirement organisations will organise a major event at the Helsinki Rautaticentor on Friday from 11 to 13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: The Hungarian police used gas in exchange for refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees in the summer.
The event took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to reach Europe, says the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break through the border.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, were also refugees in the country.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water stations against people.
The Muslim boy was held in school in Texas - the teacher thought of his own neck as a bomb
In the United States, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher took his school as a personal bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to just present his e-mail invitation.
However, one of the teachers seemed to be a real bomb.
The police were summoned to the scene, and the situation ended when the boy was put in custody in the custody of the youth.
Mohammed has not been proved at any stage to be claiming anything other than that he had done the clock.
However, it is still possible for the boy to be accused of making a lie.
According to Mohamed, the police had proved to be a "stupid bomb".
The clock is in police custody, but it was made up of clearly border crossings and digital exhibitions between the leaders.
The killing took place in the last few days, and Mohamedia was sentenced to three days in exile from school.
His father is based on the case at his borders and the American-Islamic Council of the country, whether the case is again an indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
British county - Labour leader refused to sing national songs
The song asks God to protect the royal palace, but Corby is an opponent of the monarchy.
The Court of Justice has also joined the national rapporteurs for the Court of Justice of Corbyn.
This has created a nation, a number of labs, the director of Kate Green's public radio company in the BBC radio station.
I think Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
In the former memorial service, British air carriers were respected for their fight against Germany’s Luftwaffe in 1940.
The working party defends the official opinion of Corbynia and stresses its respect for the aircraft by taking part in the opportunity.
We are all in great gratitude for the sacredness of royal air carriers.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully quietly during the national elections, and was stressed in the opinion.
Corbyin's election as vice president has broken the lab's ribs.
In particular, a group of representatives of the people are those who are afraid of his brutal opponents on radical views.
Corby supports one-half of the siege, the cessation of savings, and the growth of public expenditure.
The number of Corbynins is today the first time in the capacity of the vice-president in Parliament at the Prime Minister's question.
Corbyn has asked the general about what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
On the weekend of Cameron's novel in Twitter, Corbyn will be elected as vice president.
The working party threatens our national security, our economic security and our family security, and the Prime Minister insists on his own reputation.
I remember the reason why my family was still in the wrong... the father of the family was waiting for justice
The South Lake Minneton police have been investigating a recent week's date in Minnesota, Greenwood.
Five families were found dead on September 10th, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
The first time he hit his wife and three of them were killed by Brian Short in a car car.
I've been dead for years.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the hall for inspection and found a large house for the Short family to die.
According to StarTribunnen, it is possible that the victims had been dead for years.
Monetary sector and successful business
The investigation by the South Lake Minnesota police officer Michael Citar's case is still under way.
The motive for blood transfusions is still unclear.
Ampuja Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014 in the StarTribunnen questionnaire Short reported four million different times a week on the website.
I've been given 50 purchases by the company in the last 10 years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to make.
Kens, at some point, I'm selling the company, but I'm not yet.
It was seen, among other things, that the Short family bought two million dollars in 2011 from Greenwood.
The room is mentioned at the property site in Zillowi, a car rental dream: there are only 12 rooms in the house, as well as eight cars.
Jurisdiction of the Office
According to StarTubinen, however, the father of the family expected justice.
Achiev Test Prep, offered by various Prep Courses, had challenged him due to comments on the AllNurses.com site.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, the Short website had not removed comments from prep course reviews and thus lost customers to competitors.
According to StarTubinen, however, it is very unclear whether the exercise of justice would have had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered two coffees
In addition, the owner was paid for the treatment with the Finnish monthly horseman.
It's a great thing, Loir's comment as a beautiful kingdom.
The published Fabrice Duo won Derby's first day in September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist's band, Loir, was still surprised by Fabrice Duon's success in the big competition.
I still don't think that's happened.
Corpi, the manufacturer of the Menstyshevos, says Loir, will get a full-time job with a horse at work.
Pick up and decide which horse you're going to take to compete.
And I'm gonna have to hold my ass, Loir.
A wonderful ele of NHL - "A gift made by the greatest dancer of all ages"

According to the report of the hospital, the fact that the greatest player of all time is a single gift for charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital in another storage facility for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canadians eight years ago and 72 million dollars a year.
The amount of the Sobhan's gift is therefore significantly greater than its $9 million annual value.
In return, Subban is given a hospital called a hospital hall.
Canadian players have previously contributed significantly to local hospitals.
Last year, Captain Jean Beleveau spent millions of dollars, including the same hospital for children, and Saku Koivu spent money on another city's major hospital, where a PET scanner needed for food research was sent to the hospital.

In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports the development and innovation of the field, as well as the information published by Intel.
It is composed of security experts from various parts of the world.
ASRB researchers will be required to carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardizing best practices and planning for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
The company will continue to update its report on the basis of the ASRB research results.
The International ICT Research and Consultancy Company Gartner estimates that by 2020, the vehicle transport volume of about 150 million has been linked to the network.
Few things are more personal than our security on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60 to 75 per cent of these vehicles can be used, created and distributed online data.
We can and we need to improve the safety of cars, Intel Security Manager Chris Young says.
Using ASRB, Intel can ensure the best use of safety and support for visibility, which means that cybersecurity is important for each network connected to the design of a car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road that makes the ASRB platform the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays about 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Forum Focus RS model has been expected for years as a month to come.
Later, the car also began to be in the area of Finland.
Ford published RS's information now when the eyes of the car are on Frankfurt's car display.
The new four-wheel RS is speeded up by a 2,3-litre, 350-powered engine in 4.7 seconds and the speed is 266 kilometers per hour.
In Finland, the price is also high, initially EUR 52 000.
The car is now available, indeed, when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you in the press.
The brand Kia presented two news on Frankfurt's auto show - such are new Sportage and Optima.
In Finland, the two news is probably more important than the new fourth generation Sportage, in which Kia is planning to move ahead with the ever-increasing public of the growing waste market.
In the form of a new European shape leader, Gregory Guillaume, the sport created is more round.
I've come to the Accessian and External Committees, another one here, and the car is getting more efficient than that.
The engine option is at its top, but it adds a 1.6-litre turbo to 177 horsepower.
Add Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption to the next sales revenue.
We still have to wait a little longer because we will have a new Sportage in summer 2016.
Because a year ago, our country had a new Kia Optim.
Well, maybe the news doesn't look like a change, but there's a really new car.
Kia aims to soften the hearts of the top-class buyers by better weather characteristics, lowering the threshold and higher the equipment.
In the beginning, Optimota is supplied with 1,7 litres of turbodies and 2,0 litres of petrol engines.
First of all, they want to slow down when they get to their shore with a 2.0-litre turbo engine equipped with Optima GT.
At the same time, it will start the sale of Optima Farmer.
Chisu returned to the folds - fired in a strong battle.
Singer Chisu is involved in a life for the children at a concert with other guests.
In the electric power supply, there must be an open door.
The house is a beautiful concert hall in the middle of the siren.
It's a crown of gold metal and a red cloth.
During a three - year period, the singers who came to be the mother have received heavy loads charged with driving and sleeping.
Chisun's daughter's gonna be a year.
The psalmist would publish his first song again in August.
I went back to classes and to the big public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
It's been a while since all the music is involved, the singer tells me.
Chisu publishes a couple of weeks after the new and the same four albums called Polaris.
Your new way of life has been inspired to create new bones.
At this stage, you'll think about whether people will find my new album, Chisu.
Kim Kardashin's mother-style re-examined.
Real-tv beautiful Kim Kardashian gives the talks one after the other.
She presents her pregnancy and breast-feeding in sexual clothing, last night a time of American time when she took her sister, Kourtney Kardasian, out of the kitchen with her husband, Kanye West.
The black mother's face is a passable on the walls.
It exposes the beautiful oranges that are below the surface of the sandy plains.
Finally, Cardashia was hit by the mammothity of her childhood when she went to her friend’s funeral in New York only a few days later.
The roofs lifted the black roof over the ceiling.
The third special maternity rate is as short as last week's average when the presentation period was heavy.
The world's worst devices: Not home, you're alone, competition is terrible
However, Manon Leloup wanted to consider that the painting world would be clean of glamorous and anti-smokers.
He made his documentary speech Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak of the painting as a clean picture.
The Harpeer's Bazaar's version of Leloupin's six hard truths for the class's assurance.
Every season starts empty.
Even if you'd been posing in the minds of the planners in the past, the new time would begin again in the castings.
And every long time there will come new, young adults who compete with their peers.
There's rarely a place they can call your home.
The work is continuous travel and can last year so that it is a hotel room or apartment in which the buildings rent their furniture.
If he is too young, and his mother cannot travel with him, loneliness can be a difficult challenge.
New York and Paris are desired jobs, but they are the most stressful.
It's not just one kind of mess.
An agent in New York may ask for a bottled kilogram, but in Paris it is said that you're too weak.
Getting a job is a full-time risk game.
Design models and designers are all the time together and work in the same support network.
When we're done, the difference is bad.
The models want this area because of the opportunities it offers, but they claim that everyone thinks that the job is just a presentation of clothes.
They also want to be their own person.
Work gets models to know that they're models that have a role.
But the painting work can also reveal itself.
You're painting in Tory Burchin's show yesterday.
In New York, the best design shows where designers reveal their first year of painting.
The style changed by Roope Salminen presents an unknown Apulanta music in the film
Roope Salminen presents the founder of the band, Antti Lautala, based on the Apulanta Society's original years.
The platform was founded in Apulan in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but separated from one in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me, because I've been a rap artist for 26 years, and in this film I'm a 16-year-old karateist, Salmin's narahta.
I didn't want to see the real Anttia before the descriptions, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is clearly unknown to people of that message, so I think it's very good that I teach her how to call only video.
I don't want to be like a man.
The very stupid Roope Salmin and Koirat, a man who trusts himself, doesn't play a role.
The Punkmans come by nature to the man.
The signs, the signs of the program during the punk season, must have seen many of them, even if they've never been in our kitchen.
Our performance has never been short, but it's always going to be perfect.
In the run in 1993-2004 the base called Tuukka Temos, the leader of the company You made us the main exhibit of the beautiful picture was published today.
The band, which has become known to the general public, still presents some unknown young exhibitors to the large audience.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtas Tatu Sinisalo based Tuukka Temo from Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a drink of his next meal last night, when he told Snapchatis that he was secretly preparing his urine on the most important day of his life.
Roope has already published a new look at the image in Instagram yesterday, which he has had to make for the film.
Roope, seen in the weeks and in the snowflakes before, has grown up as a siloposic, and has colored her hair as a black.
Psychology advice: I told the children about the refugees
Many parents have had to consider, last day, how to tell their child about the refugee situation in Europe.
Or do you mind telling me about it at all?
It doesn't have to be a violent voice, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff's advice.
Younger children are encouraged to protect themselves, and for example, they are not allowed to look at the news on their own.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can be a little bit of a thought and worry, he says.
However, if your child has been distracted by TV news shows or has heard about something else, it will encourage him to speak.
The discussion is good to take the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he is asking.
The fear of the child may be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones whose parents think they're afraid of him.
The child does not have to be afraid of harm, even if he'd hurt himself and be afraid.
The younger the child follows his parent closely.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will try to be safe.
Most children probably break out of the conversation at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to talk to them about the matter if they think about the child.
The fact is, not everyone in the world is good.
Parents can discuss with their children how to deal with this.
However, is the world a safe, safe place in the end?
Parents may also have different opportunities for growth - some may want to protect their children from the dangers of breast - feeding.
On the other hand, if you are also discussing difficult things in the family, the child will be taught how to deal with the challenges ahead in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social Psychology Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weak"
You're done with your powers?
However, you can be a better parent to your child.
Vermoo's beautiful Palosalam hard castles
Perttu North was hit by the Appilan Palosalama in the middle of the winter.
It only cured the winners and the doubles until the end of July at Tampere's fair.
Because the product was sold on the ground, the manufacturer doubted the existence of something and tried to protect him from animal doctors for a while.
The explanation for the action would be important.
The horse had a victim's injury.
The people were not the worst to reach, but it took two doctors to get it to bed.
Since Apila Palosalama had to be on the smooth road, North is telling her that she was in favour of the last flight of a surprised horse.
It was in the preamble to the second SE post-Turuntu.
The Apila Palosalama was heavily pressed when it had a normal time only for a few weeks.
Well, at the end of that little attention thing, it was understandable, North said.
The manufacturer assumes that the fair competition has made the gold land.
The horse’s wrath must have gone forward, and hopefully it would have been restored too.
The Apila Palosalama has been said to have been such a humour.
When it's not interesting, it's been able to throw in the middle without any illness.
On a good day, the originals have been replaced by such a sandy list that opposers have been in their own hands.
During the summer, the passengers will not go to Palosalam, where even the hot springs will come out.
There's a hiding place in the north of Vermosa.
However, there are different things about how Apilaan Pallosalama feels about it.
It's a hard time at the time of departure, and it's possible, even if a wooden car is by the tree and that's it.
Hopefully, the gold would be more peaceful than at the start of the market.
Apilan Palosalama is well able to come from the lake as well, and we are going to be able to enjoy the victory, the manufacturer's promise.
For this reason, you can't get away from the remote iPhone program.
I'm app delivery director Tim Cook.
At least I share the future program with Apple iPhone calls, maybe in the future, but not all of them.
Apple might want to remove some of its own programs from the iPhone, tells the company's delivery director Tim Cook Buzzfeed in the questionnaire.
There are a number of programs that relatively rarely use, such as FaceTime calls, Logic, Health, Press, Podcasts and Vinkit.
The last addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became an update to the iPhone phone, although it is only necessary for Apple's intellectual owners.
According to Cook, removing the App programs is more complicated than it appears on the surface.
Some applications have been linked to someone else's iPhone.
If they're removed, it can cause problems somewhere else in the phone, Cook's gonna make Bizzfeed.
Cook did not mention what the Apple iPhone applications are working strictly with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop the habit of letting the user take them away from you, Cook.
According to Cook, Apple then investigates the matter, because the company does not want to delete a memo from the iPhone user's phone.
The euro area inflation fell by 0.1% in August
The euro area consumer prices rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent of the year, the EU Statistical Office of Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices led to lower energy consumption.
Eurostat has been reassessed for a few weeks by 0.2% in advance.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2%.
Thus, in August, the said primary inflation dropped by 0.9 per cent from July to July by 1.0 per cent.
Eurostat's baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2% worse than a year ago.
In all 28 EU countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In June, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Most of Europe's prices rose by 1.4 per cent in August in Malta.
Cyproxic inflation was at a lower rate of 1.9 per cent.
In Finland inflation was 0.2 per cent of the minimum mark according to the EU's harmonised price index.
The euro area inflation continues to be slowly away from the target of the European Central Bank (ECB) which is a two-percent increase in the medium-term price.
The ECB predicts the euro area for this year's average inflation of 0.1 per cent.
In the first year, growth rose by 1.1 per cent, the central bank predicted the publication of new inflation services in early September.
In the United States, Fed is trying to break money policy next time
In the United States, the next move will start at the speed of less than a year, but probably three years later, when the central bank of the country, Fed, is moving back to its peaks for a long time.
And the financial market will also start to defend itself before the next fall.
Fed has missed its initial condolences this week and by the end of the year.
Thus, the next shift can be put on top as quickly as possible by the first time I go to the market and before I make it to the financial market.
Or at least this happens if the world's biggest economy and the financial market are working as they have done - and if they react to hidden Fed's funds as they have done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the German bank Deutsche Bank London's market research strategies for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a long-term market and economic cycle study.
The bank distributed over 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to the international major stakeholders last week.
The research and report-based strategies do not believe in knowing exactly when Fed is going to climb its heights or what is happening in the economy and on the market after that.
Instead, they present the facts and calculations of the economic statistics by using the facts and calculations of how the economy and the market have previously been used during and after the feds.
In addition to historical findings, they examine which key changes in the economic and financial markets are now at the same time or in a different form than in the time of the summits - and what may be followed by them.
However, both the economy and the financial market are now in a better position to sustain the rise of peaks than ever before in the 1950s.
At the beginning of the year, maybe not a year.
The leaders of Fed's monetary policy and its customs office have been in the past for a long time and are beginning to argue that time begins to be able to climb the mountains.
The first survey of over nine years can be held this week.
The matter shall be resolved on Wednesday and Thursday following the meeting of the Open Market Committee so stated at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed did so, as stated by Fed Funds, in June 2006.
This led to a two-year period of relatively regular but repeated series of 0,25 per cent of corrosion units, which Fed estimated at 1,25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The financial market crisis began in 2007 on the United States' most risk-weighted housing funding difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis was re-examined as a global burden on the day of judgment.
The great tsunami was hit in 2009.
In the last few years, the serious abuses of the financial markets and the real economy have started more closely than in the wake of more recent Feds' mergers.
Accordingly, trials were more severe and more serious than ever before in the 1930 ’ s.
Deutschen’s strategies have been based on the world’s largest economic growth and wages, as well as the changes in financial markets since 1950 and in place since the early 1800s.
From the 1950 ’ s, they made a clear picture of Fed’s trends and their economic and financial effects.
The start of the study has taken the first time in less than a year, usually less than three and a half years, and less than three and a half years.
The financial market rate has ended within two years from the start of Fed's coronation.
Fed has been up and down in the morning after the early 1950s.
Each time it has been removed from some of the others, and the reports are being considered relatively narrow, so on the basis of them, it is unlikely that any of the following trends will have any effect.
The strategies also remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
The curves are too low too long
The root causes of the financial crisis are not necessarily to be identified with certainty even by research for decades.
But the three causes of the crisis and the reasons why it is so devastating are at least undisputed:
1) Feds, the ECB and other world’s largest central banks have been too fat for too long in the 2000s.
They were following a technical plan, and they also grew the following.
2) In the various parts of the financial and real economy, the paced pace of the 20-year period, and above all, too much debt has increased from the impact of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The greatest debt in the economic history of this country was born.
3) In particular, as far as the financial economy was concerned, the debt relief provided for most areas of the financial market was the largest cost of the economic history of the financial sector in question for the shares of the buildings, debts and benefits.
It is also very difficult to argue that the financial market, which is still high among the more complex debt lines, was at a low risk and uncertain level when Fed and the other central banks were at the top of the summits.
The financial institutions entrusted with the loans received no consideration until after the consolidations had begun and the cost of debt treatment had been increased.
The risks were a financial crisis, and you followed it a lot.
Bigger cup and more debt
Deutschen’s strategies do not consider what is going on, but give the subject of inspiration by mentioning, for example, the following steps:
1) Feds and other large central banks have now maintained their monetary policy offices more easily than before the financial crisis.
If, before the crisis, the roots were too deep, they are now even worse.
2) The debt has not been as bad for a long time as ten years ago, but now the debt is worse in writing than in air.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not been eased but now in various parts of the economy, the debt burden of the brother is slightly higher than before the financial crisis or at least once in time.
3) The first lower and lower liquidity from central banks has remained largely on the financial market and have lost the key securities and assets to the most expensive or at any time before the financial crisis.
Not only do the strategies of Latin America recognize the warning marks of the financial markets, but they also note that even the United States economy has not yet responded to the financial crisis and the most difficult ten years have passed by the model.
The euro area economy must have taken action at all.
In other words, the real economy is indistinguishable but correspondingly the pressures and risks of the financial markets are undoubtedly greater than before the financial crisis, when Fed is next going to hide the burden on the financial sector.
Perhaps the future picture of the French bank of the Society's General Strategy Albert Edwards' future is not as strange as it can immediately affect.
He has already prepared international investors from the bank for the following provisions:
First, Fed climbs up hills, then the financial plans relax, and soon it is time for Fed to climb the financial dividends in even greater QEs.
The Hewlett-Packard (HP) is designed to reduce even 33,000 jobs.
The share of the government's reductions refers to the part of the HP business service, the company tells.
HP is distributed to Hewlett Packard Enterprise and consumer-oriented HP Inc. company in November.
HP was the largest staff in 2011, with 350,000 employees.
In October last year, the staff was suspended by 302000.
The company shall record the estimated cost of $2.7 billion (about €2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is reduced by 25000-30000 employees.
The decreases in the consumer share will remain at 3300 over three years.
The HP intends to transfer its activities to low-cost countries so that 60 per cent of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company shall report its balanced business in such a way that none of its clients no longer respond to more than 10 per cent of its business results.
In the next year, the three major customers brought 65 percent of the profit.

More: Minister Berner has been active in the government of the Tax Corporation
Mr Anne Berner, Minister for Transport and Communications, has acted as a member of the Government of the Tax Administration, according to Ulen.
According to the above, the company's activities relate to so-called tax planning.
This is the case with the Luxembourgese Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed a member of the government named Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself said that he had left a notice of separation in May this year.
I checked the case, and it's enough that I've left a separate report.
It is almost impossible to manage and verify that registrations occur at a suitable time interval, says Mr. Ylen in the questionnaire.
Concentration after merger
The property of the Swedish Kährs company is managed through the Luxembourg-based company.
Kärzs is a parking loter who founded a Finnish parking loter with Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner works in the Government of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Government of Kärrs and in the Luxembourg branch.
According to the above, the properties of Khärs are moving through the multi-port property building in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he has taken the request of the largest owner of the company in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been with Hartwall Capital, the government of Karelia-Upofloo.
The company was asked for a partner who found Sweden.
This company is owned by the head of the company, which has a company in Luxembourg.
I realized that my task was to take care of the success of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the products of our Finnish company's capital are taxed in Finland and that the point of departure has been secured in this connection, says Berner.
Berner tells the General that Hartwall Capital's assets do not involve tax planning in the company.
According to Berner, the multiple ownership structure capable of tax is due to the fact that the largest owner of the capital fund in Khärs had already set up a Luxembourg holding company for the property.
Esposo opens the company’s maintenance centre
In Espoo Otania, the first maintenance centre of the company is open to adult asylum seekers.
The response centre is ready to take the first hundred residents from tonight.
The number of seats can be increased within the week by at least 300-400 people.
The Agency for Foreign Affairs shall be established at the premises of the Centre for Rehabilitation.
The operation is to be monitored by Luona Oy, which is particularly involved in the production of health care and health care services.
The City of Espoo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Luona Oy agree with the security arrangements of the centre.
STTK prepares an alternative job encryption package
STTTK will prepare an alternative package for government jobs.
The company also hopes that other employees will be employed.
According to President Antti Palola, there is now a major concern in the country of thought.
In alternative ways, to reduce the price of work will be returned after that.
Everyone understands that life continues after spring, Palola took note of the organization’s management meeting with the suppliers.
Palola considered that the Central European Union (EC) is not prepared for the discussions instead.
The STTK economists have calculated that the amount of the restructuring security contained in the Government’s competitiveness package will be EUR 30 million for the employee when the other side of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if there's a lot of trouble on the part of the party to have a discussion if there's one hundred.
Palola: Dialogue must be built up
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central). - (FR) Mr President, I hope that the election will take place by Wednesday, as the government will then have to give its own package of information to the press and start preparing the reforms.
Palola didn't take the position if it's realistic.
The discussion with the government is based on Palola's existence, and it has been about him to build all the time.
In particular, the STTK area of the solar system is located in Palola.
It requires that the government withdraws from the proposed legislation that it would have been implementing some of the infringements.
According to the STTK, Palola does not provide us with an alternative package to prepare the matter with the SDP that is pending.
In the past week, employers will meet on Friday in Helsinki to protest against the government's attempt to present a package of work-life secrecy.
Part of the package, i.e. the first days of the illness, the overcrowding, the sunscreens will be reduced to 75% and the ceiling will be reduced.
The STTTK stresses that the central organisations have called employers into their country of opinion and that there has been no purpose in the scheme.
Akavan Fäder thanks
The President of the Board, Mr Fjäder, appreciates the announcement made by the STTTK on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fäder, the STTTK will now come to the same line with Akava, as Akava has more advanced options for the government's presentations.
Fäder hopes that SAK will also be provided with an alternative package, because without SAK, it is not enough to cover.
President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Fjäder, hopes that Lauri Lyly, the future leader of the SAK, will prepare the options presented for the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTTK told us earlier this Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want to change security and work time.
In the middle of the week, Akava announced that it has already prepared its own presentation, which is ready to negotiate for five per cent of the country's government's competitiveness option.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have already written a long list of options for government presentations.
We are ready to consider the terms of service as part of the agreement.
On the contrary, we want changing security and working time banks, says President Sture Fäder.
Fäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akawa lines, as STTTK has done in the midweek period.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We're now preparing together a model for the government and the workers of the country, Fäder says.
The Committee of the Economic and Social Committee shall meet at 15 a.m. on the possible content of the Agreement.
"The same beast, the common whale, the dragons" - play bingo in Sipil's speech at night
Green Left of Tampere University
The Vian bingo of the University of Tampere for the night.
The prime ministers have previously held exceptional talks during the Méntsela camp and the war.
Prime Minister Ruha Sipilä speaks very differently to the people of Finland about the state of Finland's economy at the midweek Ylen Canal at 21.05.
In 1932, when asked to speak with the Prime Minister, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, the Prime Minister was holding the famous radio talk that marked the beginning of the end of the Mantslä's hat.
After that, the president and the ministers held several radio talks during the winter and the summer season.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho took President Mauno Koivisto instead of speaking for the new year, but it was more ceremony.
In 1976, President Urho Kekkone ended the law on television.
A single call, a monarchist, mine.
Sippel’s speech has raised every day’s criticism and criticism of what to come.
President of the left-hand side, Mr Arrhimäki, pointed out on Twitter that "Sipila could keep her speech on the status of the nation in the presidency as a statement by the Prime Minister, where she would also be able to discuss it."
According to the Green Ville Ninistung, "the single call has already been seen.
The leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Toimios judged on Facebook that "Monarchist of mine: the prime minister tells the people what's best for it".
SDP's president, Antti Rinne, asked the Siplia dialogue: "A half a year from the election.
Not only did the prime ministers meet with the media opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Council, the Siplian language has previously been raised and lasted about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented directly by SAK's president, Lauri Lyly, and EC delivery director Jyri Häkämmies.
The public has been assessed for the presentation of the Sipel language.
We considered the matter and determined that it is part of the public service task to promote the comprehensive public of Finland, on the line of the Director of the Public Publications of Ismo Silvo Ylen in the news.
As in the Time of the Times
The speech has also raised the irradiations.
Every day in the East, the children will enjoy good times, the children will be cut down and the best will be given.
Mother wears a beautiful shirt on top, and her father fits her shoes.
At 9:00 a.m., we are late on television than before we remember at the time of the Tammelos," writes a blogger Saku Timonen.
"When Prime Minister Sipila also speaks about why in the Finnish government there are millions of hidden assets in taxable capitals, which make up for other taxable taxpayers' savings accounts, and also tell the nation that there is a need to save when the government's money is over?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
What Sipil says, one opinion is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere, Viva.
It's published on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same Russian, the common cold, the wild, and the group life?

At Ahtisaari Guardian: The People's Party Against the Elimination of Russia's Al-Assad proposal · Global Voices
The last three years have fought against Russia's offer to which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was allowed to surrender, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisa, Russia's UN Secretary-General has proposed a plan to which al-Assad would have been able to speak in a satisfactory way after some time.
However, the latter did not agree with the proposal because they believed that al-Assad was missing within a few weeks.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaer, Russia's Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed him in the two-centred debate the three-point plan: the opposition did not receive weapons, opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the petition against al-Assad had to be completed gradually.
I know Tshurkin.
We don't have to agree on all the same things, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that you sit down with Alas, Martti, so I tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari reminds you of Guardian's question.
Diplomats are not commentaries
The Ahtisaari tells his message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the press, but it does not say two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisara's claims, but said that al-Assad's troops had already made numerous mob members and the central opposition groups refused all the agreements he had left behind.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the British Foreign Ministry of the Middle East, is in the hands of the people of Ahtisa, because according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss Al-Assad's case at any time.
Officially Russia has supported al-Assadia throughout the war.
In Ahtisa's claim, the reason for the failure is that Tshurk spoke to Moscow's authorities.
If he had told me about the Tshurkin, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same President from Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, in that case, he would have doubted whether Putin's intention was to hold power under some of the support of al-Assad.
Our own acts of worship
During the negotiations in Ahtisa, the Syrian crisis killed about 7,500 people.
According to the U.S. estimate, the death penalty was over 220 000 in the beginning of the year.
Over 11 million people have had to break their codes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The transformation of refugees into Europe is our own business.
I don't see any other options than to take good care of these rich people.
We're paying the bill that we made ourselves, Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
A security centre for asylum seekers by Turkish Torniaon
The planning of the Government in Northern Finland for asylum seekers is likely to be based on Tornion.
The centre would be based on the construction of the central city of Turin, which is empty.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to improve the management of refugees from Sweden.
Helsing's saying that the authority would have already decided to present a school building to the Ministry of Finance.
According to Saul Hyeppis, the mayor of the city of Tornion, he does not take his place.
When the whole authority was not in college and part of the message wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the first countries to decide on the matter, and he refers to the STT.
In the debate, 36 were authorized from 43.
On the contrary, 13 members of the Consequences Division were authorized.
On the basis of this, it could be expected that the decision would be a positive one, the beautiful word.
According to Mayor Timo Nousais, the city received no communication on the subject as a country, and the matter was responded quickly.
The Community would be able to assess 500 asylum seekers several times.
The applicant has examined that it could apply to such use.
The seating is a couple of meters in the yard, so it's still working in the mind of the young man.
Sip still hopes for a job market option for the blinds
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) in the public, the apportionment of funds would only cover a part of the government's aim of calculating the price of work.
However, the Government considers it to be against the option package if labour market organisations succeed in making such agreements.
She told the rapporteur that she had not been in contact with the labour market organizations.
He also did not know how serious the organizations were looking for alternatives to reporting to the government to the unemployed.
If such an agreement is created, we will take it without any other vote against it as a whole package.
The sharing of funds would be effective in the view of Cyprus, since it would represent almost all employees other than, for example, the government's planning of sunsets.
The labour market organisations could be able to agree on the cut-off of wages because they have been written instead of the labour market agreements.
The Government shall report to the public on the short-lived work of the Council of State in the first half of the week.
According to the summit, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
There's no final speaker at all.
The legislative work will then go to the movement, that is, the jungle is moving and it will become more difficult all the time.
It's a good time.
I won't go long in such things, if you want to.
In the last week of publication of the government, the list includes the modification of the final and hero's salary as free of charge for a period of one year without delay.
In addition, the first days of illness pay will be cancelled, overcrowded, sundry taxes will be reduced to 75 per cent and unemployment will be reduced.
The reforms are being carried out as a mandatory legislative end of professional associations, which has raised a strong appreciation.
Retirement agencies are organizing a major conference on the basis of action, which has also been published by many professional agencies.
The Customs Authority approved the extension of the land stock
The Customs Authority unanimously accepted the extension of the property of the Land of the village of Nordic Koivu Oy, a small village in the district of northern Koivu.
The assessment led to the fact that the project is larger and more expensive than the original one had been spoken.
Also, a fast-paced time period is very close.
It was little wonder, too, that the need for statistics was not known the year after the previous enlargement was completed.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock was adopted by 400-450 square metres in the investment programme, but the fund was further concluded in relation to the equity report.
The presentation also discussed the investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Iconen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported by the fact that it brings work and taxes to the local community.
There is no risk, because the company pays for the investment, the Water Forest (ps.) was based.
Place of worship in the language of Joensusus
The city administration had previously taken steps to bring the Catholic Catholic movement to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right to think about the choice of military tradition throughout the country.
Joensuu is not published as the capital of the capital of the Caribbean, because it does not have historical grounds and the language of the Caribbean is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensun area has become more and more popular in the early Soviet Union.
After the new decision, there will be no catalytic catalytic attacks at the centre of the city.
However, the city of Joensuu is, in case of a good view, also prepared for the introduction of the language of the kalara, such as in the information language and on the travel market.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single country, he also supports the use of the language of the kalara, which is now widely known as the life and culture of the North Karillas.
The language of Karjalan is still unique in the country, as well as a popular Joensusta throughout Finland.
Both can be used well in many forms of the country’s market.
Derogations of relations affect the animal health of the country
The interconnectors are trying to force the country to live with a strong hand.
Transport connections directly affect the economic life and competitiveness of the country.
And this affects whether they can stay here and do work, President Kari Karjalain is surprised.
He also highlights the transport which has also been repeated several times in the report.
For the whole country, it is important that our opportunities not be reduced by State measures, as is now being used.
The effects of these traffic connections should be considered, for example, on the job force of Karjaline.
The deterioration of cultural relations is due to increased attractiveness to the University of East Finland.
Of course, the best services here, such as traffic connections and your apartment, are easier to get students and employees, and the fact is that Director Jukka Mönkönen of the University of Eastern Finland is true.
He notes that bad travel connections also affect the research community, which is very moving and travel much for research.
The Recruitment Commissioner Marko Junkarinen says that it is difficult to reach the Western Finland market right now because travel connections are in short supply.
About half of the students of the University of East Finland will now come from outside of East Finland.
There are also about 10-20% of them, which is explained in part by direct contact.
You've come to my sister's army.
The view of Joensuu’s urban management of your country’s military project is apparently unique, but there is one group of soldiers.
Mr Pentti Kessakalo, Member of the City Management Board (S.A., picture), presented the whole project at the government's Mayan meeting, but his presentation was undisputed.
The Government adopted a decision by Mayor Kari Karjala, which is yet to be revised before the meeting of the municipal administration, which gives a final opinion at the same time with all other citizens.
One union in Kotkasa Kouvola's end in the first year
Your personal transport from Kotkakovola will remain in the future, even though it is one of the rarest Europeans.
Changes in personal transport between Kotka and Kouvola will occur first in March.
One of the Europeans will leave, but on Friday, he will arrive at Kouvola and the opposite.
Suspension is caused by State storage operations.
For the next four years, the United Kingdom of Transport and Communications has reduced the total amount of EUR 12.3 million to the next quarter.
The quietest roads are to be stopped.

The boys went to the cat, one didn't get down, the guys moved out.
The rescue plant survived a severe fall at 12 years of age, which was not able to get under the roof of its own apartment.
The situation was born in Toronto, Ketotia, about six o'clock in the morning.
There's an old two-year-old tree where there's no way to get closer to the cat.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to cut down the roof to the roof of the room next to it.
Some of the boys got the same route down, but not one.
The result was that the others moved from place to place and the shipyards warned the rescue plant instead of helping the vets to return safely to the ground.
FedEx in trade exchange, weaker views for statistics 2016
FedEx announced its failure in the last year of the year. The transport sector left its decline throughout the year due to the decrease in demand for railway services and the increased costs of transport.
The company is going to pay 55,000 workers for rent.
In recent years, FedEx reported that 50 000 long-term workers were employed.
The company's share dropped by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of an early sale in the middle of the week.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40 to 10.90 for the final balance in May. In advance, the figure is 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to the FactSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The benefits have decreased by 4.9 per cent, despite the average price increases. The increases will take effect on 4 January. The increase will take place in November of major or large transfers of land.
The company is still looking forward to the growth of the previous year due to the increase in costs, increased trade and net sales.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Smith, said that the company has done well in a much weaker economic situation, which has tested production and world-wide trade in particular.
A day after the contract was notified of the plan for the hire of workers, the day after the contract was announced by the UPS competitor to pay the workers at the same level as in the last year, 90 000 to 95 000 people.
By the end of 31 August, the FedEx business target was $692 million, which meant a six-per cent increase.
The partial result was $2.42. Zacks Investment Research company's forecast of $12.44 for 12 analysis was then left.
The turnover increased by five percent to 12.3 billion dollars.
According to a six-year analysis by the Zacks Investment Research company, the turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
FedEx has been tested in recent years by a reduction in the transmissions of the international community, which has led to the collapse of the company's Express unit.
The strong growth in the network trade has been confirmed from the results of FedEx Ground.
During the last decade, the shift in land transport has increased by 29 per cent, but the cost of large-scale shipments and insurance has increased.
The Express unit produced better due to higher basic taxes, while the production of handicraft was lower due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of an early sale, FedEx's share rate was $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $15.15.
As part of the disbursement, 11 per cent of the average of the year was completed and 17 per cent were written on 11 June under the higher heading.
This week the U.S. Central Bank’s decision-makers meet for the most expected year of the meeting. The group will sit on the side of an eight-six-six-six-square-square tree for the first time until about ten years.
The Central Bank's corrosive, two-wheeled meeting room is located on the wall of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen's colleague, must set the state's financial contribution to the advancement of all other interests.
The Central Bank has double rates at conventions: maximum employment in the United States and maintain prices here.
However, the central bank’s leadership after the fall, after the fall, has taken note of a third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be lacking in the decision of the Bank of the Central Bank, and it is appropriate to state whether the United States economy is ready to start a visit from the unexpected business situation that has been offered by short courses by the end of 2008.
Although the majority of the data show that the economy is stable, the latest share of the financial market can already be made available to the authorities of the prudent central bank to increase its liquidity by raising the reference rate of the Union's taxes – even by the fourth percentage unit.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important thing in monitoring their practical monitoring," said the bank user Stifel Nicolaus & Co's lead economist Lindsey M. Piegza.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank seeks to be free of taxes, the increased uncertainty of global markets is enough to give the issue of waiting," Piegza continues.
The issue is not the same as what the central bank intends to do, and it is already a cause of confusion in itself.
About half of the economics in Bloomberg's study were refurbished this week.
However, the financial market considers that the central bank is expected and, according to the central indicator, only 30% is possible for growth.
If the central bank is able to raise its leadership rate, the shares can be counted, unless the decision-makers are slow to agree on the second rate.
As a diastic Dow Jones industry averages your index of 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage units 16 599.85.
"In the wake of the crisis, there were expectations that the central bank would maintain its leadership this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski.
"It would be surprising if the central bank would raise its head at this stage," he said.
"If this has happened, the central bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands on the financial market in good faith."
On the other hand, the experts concluded that raising the capital markets could lead to a calming of the financial markets and removing uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Only a month later, the central bank had a high rate of 0.25 percentage units this month. This would be the first small step in strengthening the financial situation and thereby strengthening the United States' contribution.
Yellen has proved to be a long time of calm and start to expect the rise of mountains this year – despite the need for economic progress by liberals.
Although the creation of jobs was slow in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate dropped by 5.1 per cent in the last month. It is now at the lowest rate for seven years and close to the level that the central bank will consider full employment.
The results of the competition seem to be overwhelming.
Although inflation continued to decline under the 2 per cent annual objectives of the central bank, the central bank’s decision-makers concluded that this is the central reason for the gradual impact of oil prices on the market.
"The money can be spent on the top three pillars and it needs them as long as they take into account the difficult situation of the labour market," said the Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson.
However , the world’s financial market did not disappear in the last month , when China devastated its currency .
The Dow Jones industry has even released 16 per cent of the expected peaks in May, and investors feared that China's economy would also have an impact on global growth.
The market's gone down this month, and Dow Jones has already counted about 10 percent of the polling in May.
The market share of the central bank’s decision-makers means that the basic increase in the leadership is reversed.
"The Central Bank's work is still going on despite what has happened on the financial market and what has been said about the deterioration of the economy in China in recent weeks," UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate’s older researchers and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliner said.
Now he believes that the central bank is waiting for at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is a great uncertainty about what will have an impact on the economy of the United States.
The improvement of the world economy is not a major concern of the Central Bank, so it should not, in principle, affect the decision-making of the Central Bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential will of the world’s financial system.
The impact of the Central Bank has been great in recent years.
In 2013, only the error of then President Ben S. Bernanken was that the central bank could slow down its operation, and it was in the process of global warming.
In today’s world, markets and economies are very close to each other. In addition to monitoring the world’s development trends, the central bank is also required to contact other central banks and experts in order to have a comprehensive picture of the world’s economy.
"The central bank's decision-making process is more experienced than knowledge," said President Zachary Karabel of the Investnet Incin's Global Strategy.
President Jeffrey Lacker Richmond's Regional Central Bank stated this month that the Central Bank has previously exceeded the movement of financial markets that do not recognise the link between economic players.
Mr Lacker, a member of the Union's Open Market Committee (Federal Committee) who voted in favour of the establishment of the Steering Committee, took the lead, for example, in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis led to the decision by the Central Bank at its three meetings to reduce the leadership rate of 0.75 per cent, even though it had only marginally recognised effects on the economic growth of the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the Central Bank made a decision.
"The Central Bank should put the financial stability of the prime minister only in a significant crisis, as in the collapse of 2008," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Committee of the Bank of England.
The last death is not even approaching such a situation," he said.
"The rise of the churches in the name of no one to be afraid of market degradation," added Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and there is no mention of the stability of the money. Before this change comes, I don't want to go on."

Brazilian Rio Granden Medicines Association promotes a fair choice of food for pregnant women
The Brazilian Rio Grande Children’s Association SPRS has developed a skeletal habit to teach pregnant women the importance of a healthy diet. They are given pictures of babies born from a breast with unsatisfied food.
The human breast region consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and hydrocarbons. So the baby gets all he needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Because of excessive energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie levels by about 500 kilograms.
In addition to adding calorificity to the new study, other changes should be made to the choice of food.
A recent study by the Texas Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland revealed that a pregnant woman’s healthy diet can affect the genes of the baby and protect the development of the baby.
Unfortunately, malnutrition was found to have a negative impact on the immune system of the child.
Seven's Sunrisella's most visible, even though Nine's trying to get a lead on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson wanted Canberra to make breakfast programmes for the leaders of the Liberal Party, which, however, did not bring to the attention of Today.
The Nine-cane morning program was sent from the capital of Malcolm Turnbull, an isolated Tony Abbott.
David Kochin and Samantha Armytagen were sent from London for a competitive Canadian morning program. A number of special messages will also be sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
At least it was not apparent that it was important for Australian television viewers, since Sunrise looked at 397 000 viewers in the five capital cities of the country, and today's program was 339,000 viewers.
The true sights rose slightly to the last moons (317 000) and the stars (283 000), but the last of the tower was to read (343,000).
Soda's been fucked up for the last month of Sunrise's life.
In August Todayl had an average attendance of 318,000, Sunrisella 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, there were between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise, on the other hand, has access to a average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314,000 viewers.
This is what I've been interested in all of this.
The changes in the winds affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The remarkable news was that Seven had 800 Words, which included the previous Packed to the Raffers, by Erik Thomson.
The new drama soon tells of a father who decides to change the New Zealand border with his two children. The new series has reached a peak of 1,219 000 viewers.
Critics are in doubt, would Thomson be alone for the emergency list, without Raffers, Rebecca Gibney.
According to the preliminary observations, the response is clearly welcome.
Seventeen The X Factor maintained its strong position in a view of 1,136,000. The series appeared in church The Block (838 000) and the TBL family series (726,000).

Of course, Sam Wood is a son of the Unelmi – but who is the man who chooses?
Is the secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Flelows, Sarah Mackya and Snezana Markoski may have appeared unexpectedly in the election of Unelmi's son.
The final choice of the dreamer Sam Wood has been a very hidden secret.
Three of the following women don't even know who's got the last meal from the boy.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jeavons-Flelows the feelings of one of three. The women could hardly hate who would be the winner.
Sam Woodin's voices are definitely signed up to the final of the cake.
All three women failed to see that Wood is a perfect man. The women greeted the man’s smile, dignity, family values and positive qualities and made him an appropriate match for himself.
When the woman was asked who would be my best partner, if the last Russian didn't fit in, they could give their answer to the one who took the boy's heart.
Jeavons-Flelows and Marcoski quickly named Mackay himself the most suitable partner to your partner Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have all been in touch from the beginning.
"I immediately came to the hall to note that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has remained throughout the program," said Jasons-Fellows.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and she's really happy to follow," Markovski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit that there's chemistry between them.
They're acting naturally from a couple.
Sarah Mackay likes herself and Sam Woody as a good couple.
Mackay told me that last week at home in the city, that Wood could be the right one.
"When I saw him following my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a cat. Now I'm putting our relationship in perfect," Mackay said.
When Mackayl was asked, who Wood should choose if the man didn't choose him, the woman respectfully answered:
"I can't say," he said.
"I have a lot of other girls, Sneza and Lana are equal."
In the middle of the night, the children of the town of Ten-Canal were born at 19.30 a.m.
The story is from the beginning of the published search "Sarah Sam Wood's choice?"
Jarryd Hayney has several options for starting the NFL
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne, who had changed this to the United States. Many others were also interested in the man after the opening day of the last year.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and producer Jim Tomsulan, and the choice appears to be on the side.
Some manufacturers would have been held on the Himalayas, as the man walked on the shores of the Australian guillotine. Take your seat on the flight back to the team to be defeated in Minnesota from 20 to 3.
However, Tomsula showed her trust in Hayin and gave him a new chance to return to the airport. The cook was in Hayeen after the shooting of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also continued her line after the game.
He didn't steal the results in front of the other group, but he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly participated in a press conference after the game.
49er's Special Agent Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from Specialist Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the inconsistencies and concentrate on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne's in the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fans were waiting for another man's NFL deby.
After the failure, Hayne removed from the field and later told Hamish and Andy 2DayFM 104.1 that it would not have been possible to imagine a more painful start to the NFL.
"They're hurt and have to move forward," Hayne said.
Hayne reported an error at the State of Origin in 2007, when her food in her area opened up to Queensland.
In general, however, the experience was an incredible 27-year-old.
Hayne would publish a picture in Instagram where she will compete with the fans and the Australian League.
Elton John and President of Russia Vladimir Putin discuss the rights of homonyms

Four dead police suspects in Nepal
Four people died in the South Nepal, and the authorities told them in the middle of the week. The police shot a group of violent groups of people in the country who claimed to be the new constitution. The Uhrites group had a four-year-old son.
In the region of Rupande, the small towns of the capital of Katmandu were hit on Tuesday morning.
According to border officer Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 volunteers were gathered outside of the police station, some of which were destroyed by stones and bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used gas and came up before the fall.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were attacked.
It is not quite clear why the types of fungi that can kill but which are generally considered to be the least destructive option were so deadly.
This was a recent joint week in ongoing protests in southern Nepal, where new countries based on the new Constitution of Madesi would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe requires its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are cops, have died in violent camps since 10 August,
when four major political parties signed a treaty on the land distribution to the lands. This is an important step towards a new constitution, but it is a very strong issue in Nepal, where the government has been concentrated for centuries.
The new Constitution has been in force since 2008, but legislation accelerated processes since the beginning of April when thousands of people died.
The legislators have voted in favour of the Constitution in Katmandu this week, and according to the authorities, new constitutions could be accepted by the authorities until Sundays.
NHC root centre: 60 per cent probability for cyclone on the south side of Cape Verde
From a wide low area of approximately 560 km to the southernmost part of Cape Verde, 60 per cent of the population is likely to develop a tropical cycle within the next 48 hours, known as the National Hurraine Center.
According to the Miami Air Station, Cape Verde and the Small Antillian Peninsula also have a clear low-pressure centre. It can also be a 60 percent drop in the probability of developing a tropical cycle during the coming two-month period.
Google is going to collect 11 million dollars for the refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced its launch campaign, which seeks to add $11 million to humanitarian aid organizations that help different sides of Europe to fight and put poverty in thousands of people.
Google announced the award campaign in a particular personal way in the blog.
Instead of taking the lead, Google's employee Rita Masoud started by sharing his own experiences. He was only seven years old at the funeral with his family in Kabul.
"We were in a dark hole and in a bus and we were hungry, hungry, cold and scared," Masoud wrote.
I was happy.
In many of the situations in which the crisis of the European refugee and transit crisis is affected, family needs to be helped strictly.
The solutions are aimed at non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children ry and UN refugee organization.
When donations have been sent to google.com/refugeereef via $5.5 million, Google allows to provide the corresponding amount, where the total amount exceeds 11 million.
The crisis in Europe is worse than the second world war, and the situation is particularly worse than the four-year Syrian internal conflict, which is why over four million people have been forced to leave their homes this year.
The war must also be fought by Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Hypersensitivity diabetes mellitus
According to the new study, type 2 diabetes mellitus may benefit from an increase in body fat for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether the excess type 2 diabetes is mild after a muscle transplant, longer than those who receive unexplained treatment.
"The receipt of death data takes time," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the medical history, who discussed a new study in JAMA Surgery.
In the body cell, the barrier surgery is reduced by a different method.
The surgical methods reduce hunger and limit food intake in the body.
Over the years barriers have been identified as effective treatments in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have been involving patients with at least 35 hypertensive people with BMI.
The pressure index indicates the weight and duration of the normal value of 18.5 to 24.9.
When the pressure index is more than 25, the person is overweight and over 30 is reporting significant mobility.
You can count your weight index on reference 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers from the Min-Sheng Hospital used the data collected from 2007 in a study comparing the two treatment procedures, the prevention and treatment of lung cancer, the treatment of type 2 diabetes in healthy subjects.
After the movement of meat, the weighted average rate decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The weight index for treatment without interruption was maintained in recognition of 29.
In patients with diabetes, 36% were better and 28% were more likely to be treated.
When treated in the diabetes group, only 1% and only 2% were treated.
The study also found that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the treatment group.
Researchers also observed haemoglobin levels A1c in patients representing the development of the blood sugar level.
According to researchers, the haemoglobin-A1c recommended is below 7%.
The haemoglobin-A1c value decreased by 9% to 6% after the injection.
In the treatment group, the value remained at approximately 8%.
The haemoglobin-A1c value tells us about the management of blood sugar levels. However, Tri Chih-Cheng Hsun led the study group found that this did not reduce mortality during five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different approaches.
In the five-year phase endpoint group, the weight loss was higher compared to the weight loss group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the weight index was higher (7.4 and 5.1) and the haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%).
The new study did not require a lower mortality rate after five years. However, according to a Swedish study in Blackstone, the Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine, this treatment was performed for healthy people.
In a Swedish study, the victims of a fatal accident were killed by less than 29 per cent of the traditional treatment received in the group compared to 15 years of death.
Although no lower mortality was found in the new study, Blackstone found that persons under 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding of the study, as it says that the delay is safer in the lower pressure index group, and it does not increase the risk of failure or renal disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should be treated with severe stress when the weight index is 27-30.
"We expect too long that people will start to face the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"As genetic changes in the human body tend to lead to muscle and diabetes, turning into a very difficult situation is difficult."
"All cannot come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is not able to respond to all the refugees, the Dalai Lama has said that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leadership of Tibet Buddhism has called for the end of violence in refugee homes.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis during a visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama held its speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion centre, which focuses on the ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation, humanity must continue to be confined to individual countries or countries.
He also stressed that while the response to the refugee crisis in Western Europe must be surprising, it must not be enough in this situation.
"It is impossible to imagine that everyone could come to Europe," the Dalai Lama said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked the actions of Germany and Italy in the crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"The thousands of refugees' attention is great, but at the same time it is worth considering long-term solutions and how we can get time to find peace and real development in these Muslim countries, almost through education," Dalai-Lama insisted.
"We must finally discuss how we can reduce killing in these countries.
The use of energy needs to be reduced.
The power machines never solve problems," he added.
In addition to the comments made by Dalai Lama on 11 September, George Bushi acted in connection with terrorist attacks and claimed that the United States received an uncontrollable event in response to the terrorist attacks.
"After the sittings of 11 September, I expressed my concern to President Bush and told him that the solution was due to non-violent violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he protected the forces that had unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
I'd like to talk about four-lined cases in four-year-olds
According to the Georgian Mortgage Centre, in various parts of the U.S., alcohol consumption is being driven by a strong wave of gambling attacks in children under 12 years of age from 2010.
According to the director of the Georgian Mortgage Centre, Gaylord Lopez, the number of suicide incidents reported for children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly growing in children, and unfortunately some of the children are getting pregnant," Lopez told CNN.
In conclusion, children use their hands for the purpose of helping their friends and social media spread.
YouTube videos feature tennis ageing because of the bad smell of deinficinating substance.
In other words, a combination of desinfigenated alcoholic strengths should be used to obtain more alcohol than that.
Smaller children can touch the fruit of their hands.
"You don't think the substance is bad," said Lopez.
"Most of the attractive handicraft products are just upset.
The offer contains sweet handmade products of manic, wine and apples that attract children."
The alcohol content of desinfioin substances is 45 to 95 %.
A small number of young children can cause alcohol abuse.
"The alcoholic strength of the pancreas is very high," said Professor Stephen Thornton of the University of Kansas Medical Sciences at the University of Kansas City.
"No one should leave children exposed to whiskeys, but if the disinfectants are often left on children, they will soon receive a large amount of alcohol."
Six - year - old Naijah Russell recently enjoyed four - year - old boys from boarding school, and the girl was offered to take care of the ice cream.
"The high blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice as high as the adult vacuum cleaner," says Dr. Chris Ritchey Atlanta from the Gwinnett Medical Center.
He was a soldier, and he couldn't walk when he was brought to the throne.
Doctors followed the girl’s condition over the night in a different hospital for brain damage, as the girl had lost her head with alcohol," Ritchey said.
"Your daughter was really scared," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Finally, it is recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants in addition to the fact that your hands should be transferred to children’s inexhaustibles.
In addition to the alcohol business, part of the disinfectants has been associated with fatalities.
In 2013, two Anthariese people died of hand washing, which contained a toxic substance that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contained in the product was fatally metabolised instead of ethyl alcohol, even though the latter has been reported to be an active substance in the product chain.
According to the police report, three fourth-class students in the northern part of New York State planned to kill a "all" teacher in January by setting antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to the hands and refused to go to the school room.
The police considered that the proposed plan was important and urged the school to commit suicide.

Dutch love the old Scotch fighter – de Boer
Former Rangers' middle player and Dutch national player Ronald de Boer have said that the Dutch football fans' interest in Celtici is over, because Celtic and Rangers are no longer able to watch two games.
De Boer, who worked in the team leader of the age group, said: "The Netherlands no longer presents Celtic games places.
Because Rangers is no longer with us."
"You don't just talk about Rangers' request.
We're talking about Old Company here.
The Dutch people love two fights between the groups.
There's a great zeal in the company, and they're also interested in Scotland's boundaries."
I'm going to make sure Deila's back.
Ronny Deila admits that Celtic has difficulty, but the Norwegian team ensures that the situation changes.
Malmolle lost her track of the Masters' crew and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has five points to lead on the table.
"Celtic has had difficult sections before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
"We want to meet our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very destructive, and it wakes up in many anger or death.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
We urgently need the support of Celtic supporters because it strengthens players significantly.
It's very important now."
Warburton alert in January players
Although only a few weeks later, Mark Warburton was in trouble with the players' positions in January, he was cautiously referring to the transition and said that he wanted to threaten the unity of the team.
"The events of January differ significantly from who moved," said the ex-valminator Brentford.
"The players involved in the group will be able to move to the group before the start of the course, which has now been successful in our meeting.
The group's going really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player ratings may cause a group more harm than useful."
Mr Michu of the Celtic's most remarkable resurrection
The Swanse attacks on Michu have been linked to Cellici's players' exchange talks, and for Micho, they have been denied the residence of the Swans contract.
At the age of 29, Michun had been a vicious liar for years, and he did not succeed in getting a move from Wales in the middle.
Hearts prepared for the SFA presentation of Nelson's comments
Hearts led 2–1 when Paterson was removed from the village. The group eventually lost a red card of the party from 3–2 later. This already has three Collum's red card within eight months, which is burned.
However, Nelson remains behind his words. "I did not question the reality, I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths acts as a protection against Tynecastle
Griffiths was invited when the man admitted his violent songs by former Hearts player Rudi Skacele.
The airport was set up in the region of Edinburgh Roseburn before the construction of Edinburgh in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"In the future there was a local trade, and the feeling was mild," said the attacker. "I can guarantee I will not go back to Tynecastle except on the Celtic River."
Tannadicen Group believes Dundee Unit – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that the Dundee Unit's leadership can make things better.
"Stephen Thompson is with us.
We'll get the boys ready for dinner," Donnelly said.
McInnes satisfied with Hamilton's victory in the battle
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdee had to be brought in in an inconsistency against Hamilton before his seven-year term of overcrowding. He was able to beat Aberdee at five points in the foot of the Celtic Street. It is thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half.
"It's not a team of Cups or T-shirts that wouldn't have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment in Scotland, growing in the UK
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged from May to June. The unemployment rate in the United Kingdom was 164,000. The total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom rose to 10 000.
According to the Office for National Statistics, unemployment was 5.9 per cent in Scotland when it was 5.5 per cent throughout the United Kingdom.
There are 12 000 fewer in Scotland than three months earlier, and the number is now 2,612 000.
Scotland's employment rate dropped by 74.0 per cent per year. The total average employment rate in the United Kingdom is 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish Minister of Affairs, David Mundell, made a few remarks: "In the long-term plan of the Government, a foundation for a strong economy has been established."
Almost a year later, Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
Scotland's labour market situation has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why are we following the expedition to Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is a legal basis for reinstatement, I will follow the investigation.
If the execution is carried out what I do not expect, I will sit in the execution hall of the Oklahoman State Court of Criminal Court, when Richard Glossip is executed in the darkness.
Glossip has asked me one of the four official witnesses.
In January, I received a call from the best friend of the man, and despite my frustration, I responded favorably.
I'm in my trouble by day.
Then why did I agree?
I was surprised because I thought I could tell you this about the death penalty for the truth.
The view would be unique.
Operators will be able to follow up in the United States, and as applications are more than local, participants will be selected at the makaaber value.
The classroom has reduced the provider's location by 12:00.
The choice of the next production will be artificial.
I can't do that.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a man's personal relationship, because we've been talking on the phone for months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often in our conversations.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be in the place of the witness or the supplier, so I cannot take the memory card and try to make my memory efforts.
I just have to try to make details of my mind.
One of the academics accused me of threatening independence on Twitter.
"The principle is this:
When you tell him a certain story in a pleasant way, you get close to him."
I asked the supplier for a different opinion.
The active one admitted that he could have been more careful in his own words, but he still considered my actions wrong.
Richard Glossip has been different from some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't know what I'm writing, and if he's trying to figure out, I wouldn't.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants to place an international supplier who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will promote the death penalty against trafficking.
The Huffington Poster Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information about the subject, you can hear my podcast message.
I'm not going to repeat details in this connection.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is guilty.
After Barry Van Treese's murder, his actions would have resulted in his death after he was convicted of a crime.
I believe, however, that it is very likely that Mr. Glossip has not been convicted of murder.
I do not believe that evidence on the basis of the death penalty has been sufficient.
I think his performance is wrong.
From this point of view, I'm following his performance.
I can't claim to be completely half-life.
An independent description can read from other suppliers' stories.
I'll tell you what it feels like to see a man die in the dust.
A man was shot from Canningjoe after a police officer
Canning Valen's constapelt stayed at six o'clock in the morning, holding a man up from Canningjoe.
The perthilis man's demand for your ass is going down, in other waters, a few meters away from the police got a man's land back to a dry land.
The Canning Valen police had received a silent call for an unexpected stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found a suspect trying to punish the police by heading to Canningjoke.
But the man didn't get away.
"The man standing in the water announced that he would not come out of the water and ask the police to ask him for water," said former superintendent Snarl Castle.
Constapell Lachlan Perhavecia’s official appeal did not come about, so he chose a safer tactic – a negotiation.
"In other words, a demand company can protect a person in ways that are of interest," said Colonel Castledine.
Mr. Ben Coussin's case is an interesting example.
In 2006, Cousins stopped his car in order to avoid a police complaint and tried to get away from Swanjo on the other side.
The man's business was doomed to destruction, but the storm was intent on planning the local Ben Cousins biothlons.
According to Peter Moody, the authorities tried to force him, and he threatened to stop his competition.
Peter Moody blames Racing Victors for the rape company last year. The man threatened to stop the competition immediately.
Moody claims that the executives and the Racing Victorian charity have attacked him personally, and the recent treatment of Lady Tata was the last white week due to the treatment given on Friday.
Moody told Fairfax Mediale always to work for the competition team. Moody has had a difficult situation when Lidar's show found a cobalt, and the man was unable to explain the finding.
Moody has been in the wrong language for the past year and has not wanted to interfere with the activities of the guilty man.
"I didn't intend to raise the matter. I guess this is a long time ago, but sometimes turbulence comes in the corner," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"I must respond and accept the consequences. I must now accept the situation after I opened my hand.
I'm going home and I'm having a good night.
I want to go on my way, and I want horses' owners to believe that I'm the best.
If the owners don't believe it, I'm no longer suffering as a horseman.
I would think of my future as a licensed producer."
Moody dropped a bomb earlier in the Racing.com questionnaire, where he told about the charity companies in his possession.
"Six months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered to a certain man a job for my five purpose in hiding my work. I told the man by name," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a hero.
If so, they'd be pleased to present the evidence, because I've never been able to hold on to anything without a promise.
RVL's former President Robert Roulston, RVL's current President David Moodie and RVL's current deliverer, Bernard Saundry, were aware of the operation then and now.
Should I take the situation as a personal guide?
Should the RVL take action and maintain responsibility for the situation in the area for others other than the manufacturers?
Am I in trouble?
Am I really in trouble with the area?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Maybe I should still be prepared and work out of my duties, and no doubt I can think of a lot of things like this.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore.
It's really painful.
I'm going to force them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can swim."
Little by little, the investigation of Lidar's cobalt values and your short-hazardous refusal eventually led to the final destruction of the ready-to-do so that the man threatened to release his license.
Moody is known as the best inconsistencies of Master Black Caviar. The man described the day-to-day treatment to laugh after the horse's legs had an anti-sharp set of rules.
"The treatment is contrary to the rules.
I'll take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"The person who belonged to my personality wrongly put a white horse on his horse's leg.
I'd have been able to take care of it last night.
It could have been done yesterday, and so did it.
But it happened on Saturday."
Moodya may wait for a three-month competition dispute on the anti-sharp treatment that the organizers have begun to deal with.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been made by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands the need for rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobramin's coral reefs
The police have arrested the man who took me out of the corridor for a week.
The driver was taken by the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital, and he got a heavy tire on his car crash at Murray Valley Highway in the morning.
According to the police, the man who took off my luggage and didn't leave to help the wheelchair.
On Monday, 50-year-old Nathalia was notified to the police of Shepparton.
It is likely that the reasons for the suspension and aid obligations are expected to be met in the absence of transport and in other business meetings.
The 40-year-old circuit overseer from Cobrami is still in the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm manufacturer Craig Bellamy refers in English to the press of opposers
Melbourne Storm manufacturer Craig Bellamy considers his team to be critical of NRL's two overarching activities.
According to Sydney Rooster's founder Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm a daughter of the Melbourne fathers a hard time in winning a career in Sydney as a family member.
Brisbane Broncos, founder Wayne Bennett, was concerned about the reference to Stormin Broncos to the casinos at the Queensland Cowboys Sunday morning. He called the game a simulation and admitted that there was no particular pressure in Queensland.
Bellamy played his own team and told them only to get in touch with him.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team added that the two team members criticized his team. Bellamy considers this proof that the trainers are concerned about destroying Storm.
"This is always going to happen. To remember, Trent Robinson didn't say anything when his team won us 24-2," Bellamy said in the middle of the week.
We haven't changed in our defence system or in our technology all year round, and we've only been put into contacts and ties, which has turned us up.
Trent's been in charge for three years.
It is interesting to note that the same thing is always rising at the same time of the year.
Bellamy was not interested in Bennett's idea of what is interesting about football. He reminded me that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won over 2010 by playing stupid football.
"Wayne's talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team to play our family games and considered their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010 St George received a series of criticisms in part of his play. Wayne decided that the rating would not be short-lived.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast-paced.
He wants to play a football game when he's a player-arsenal like this.
Now he wants everyone to play his style, and all teams don't have any central players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I am given more self-reliance when others are concerned about my group's approach to this kind of security.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us in a lot of games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the games of Storm and Roosters made the worlds more than the meeting of Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the end? 16-12?
The end of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it an interesting football game?
Or are toys and low-fashioned football?
I think my goals are interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
The Storm has a free weekend because the team will be able to come to visit the North Queensland Cowboys Crown Sharks tomorrow at the AAMI Park. The tickets will be sold on Tuesdays.
Serbians free 200 000 dollars against fraud
A man who can rely on a life-threatening decision of 40 kilos of the cocaine company in Queensland has been released free of charge against 200 000 dollars.
Marco Maximovic, 29, was one of five men who was arrested for the last month by the police on a hundred-kilo-cocked Solay ship that had come through the Old Town from South America and arrived to visit Coomera in August.
The police looked at the meeting of Maximovic and the crime scene on Friday morning and then surprised two of the Coomera Roadhouse coffee shop. At the parking lot, a 40-kiln truck from Toyota Echo was found.
Although Maximovicia may expect a life-threatening drug to be used for commercial purposes, there is no evidence that the man's head would have tried to get his entire management, but the man could have been in a cup of coffee.
According to Judge Peter Flangan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape from the country.
"Maximovic has clear connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia several times," the judge ruled in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police at his place of residence."
Maximovic's mother and father paid together 200 000 dollars against which man was released.
"In view of the overwhelming evidence of both persons, it is clear that 200 000 dollars are a real economic burden to them," said Dr. Flanaga.
"But it's not enough to stop the man from packing," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he and his passports in Australia and Serbia are notified to the police every day and stays home from night to morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to send pictures of pedophiles
Pedophil was used by a 11-year-old girl to get her management pictures in which children are being treated.
Stevan Hogg took the girl to bed and wrote her online mail service, where she got another user to send herself inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, the girl will wake up and see her sleeping in Hoggin's hands.
When the contents of her phone call were found, the girl found satisfactory messages and immediately told her mother about it.
Five of these photos were reported to the police. The computers found on the evidence found by the police found disturbing Internet applications that have been used to search for unaccompanied children.
Hogg claimed that the police were trying to lead pedophiles on the Internet, and that the police presented to the police in order to scare the pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilid Robertson stated in the local court in Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had been hurt by the computer, but he claimed that he was acting to represent the police and thus be afraid of pedophiles.
Hoggil was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and who had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to lead the pedophiles to the war.
He told me that he was getting disturbing thoughts in his hair and that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the messages from our phone were received, the girl cried to her mother with tears and tears."
The girl saw inappropriate images on the phone, which was subsequently heard by Hoggia.
The girl told the accused computer and Playstation to talk to herself with the girls who appeared to be younger.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward on the Road recognized the charges for the abuse of children. On 14 June last year, Hogg broke his eyes on 25 January this year and left him unreachable for hearing on 24 March this year.
Advocate General Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia should not be registered as a sexual offender, since it could be considered that there were no significant sexual boundaries involved in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael closed the proceedings for the final hearing because of social work reports.
In this regard, Hoggy was granted freedom of speech, but he was held in trial for other reasons.
Hogg was added to the sex-related register before the date of the judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has the wrong voice in Parliament
An elderly African State Chief Mugabe died in the streets leading to the speech period earlier this year.
Mugabe didn't get upset, but the video that happened was spread rapidly in the social media.
Parliament's openings also warned the opposition legislators that they had received anonymous killings, warning them to defeat Mugabel during his speech.
In the last month, the representatives of the People's Republic were standing up and in the middle of the president's state debate in Parliament, and the President was the same speaker.
Innocent Gonese, the MDC party identified the texts of the seven opposition policies in which they are invited to be without disturbing Mugabe’s speeches.
"The message has been sent by an unknown number, but the search for the message is "slow," Gonese told the suppliers after the Mugaben speech.
The Communication warns respondents that representatives outside Parliament are no longer within the scope of immunity.
According to a half-year-old, Morgan Tsvangira's party is concerned about the threats posed by politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard aims to reduce 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of the reorganisation and storage activities of the company's services.
The HP will be divided into two press companies later this year and will separate computer and output business activities from faster growth of business equipment and services.
According to the HP report, the company will record the estimated cost of $2.7 billion on its regular costs from the fourth quarter of the year.
"Renewal arrangements allow for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise for a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said HP CEO Meg Whitman, who runs the company after distribution.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise must be a smaller and more focused company of the current HP, and we have wide and deep portfolio business that helps companies move into a new business type." Whitman said.
"Our own company is better than ever and we are better able to respond to the needs of our customers around the world."
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company focuses on providing unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company is now divided into two by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s. Both are based on an electronic purchase in Palo Altos, a car that is now known as the birthplace of Pilaiakson.
HP has carried out massive reorganisations in the case of the traditional design equipment being transferred to mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer in the world and the largest technology companies in the United States are the new HP changes in the area where it is believed that focusing on this success is successful.
Captain of Arsenal Michael Arta: The team must support the disappointment of Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilsher that it's September.
The best possible scenario is that Wilsher must certainly leave at least four English football games.
The biggest difficulty in the last problem is that Wilsher decided strongly after the last one, and appeared back in the back of the previous stage of the new road.
"It's not a threat to the wind," Wenger said.
"The moon didn't improve well.
That's not a serious problem.
This was just an accident.
It did not relate to his jokes or to his most serious abuses."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wengerki pointed out, more powers may come when the player tries to get back to the village in the middle of the day.
There is also an obvious lack of regularity in this regard.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different problems from the time Wilshere started down six years ago.
He also played at the Arsenal River in 65 only 157 passengers during the last five years.
The broader picture of Arsenal is that from the sixth and sixth centuries from 2007 to 2008, the group has been the second of the groups that lost money because of the cut-offs.
Wenger accepts the possible lead, but Arsenal believes that the recently improved dropout statistics will continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometime after the application may be associated with a period of time that has to strengthen the body and require competition authorities," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he's gonna figure this out.
I hope he will be balanced. I believe in it, and through it his urine will continue to be the one he deserves."
Arsenal begins his visit to Mestria in midweek against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet in Chelsea on Saturday and the following Wednesday in Tottenham Hotspur. Wenger prepares small changes to the convention.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be starters.
Wenger can also hold a preliminary conference on the status of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to take care of the team's balance and give it time to those who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clearly a sponsor of the F group, Maximir Zagreb is the most feared stadium in Europe.
Dinamo has also been in a total of 41 games.
Stadonia was treated with thiastic acid when the country was vaccinated at 3.2 Richter.
It was ten in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned in his last journey to Monaco, and he is also motivated by a long hope for the trust of the team in Europe.
"We have a great energy field," Wenger said.
"Arcenal has not yet received this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also realistic in terms of experience.
We're honorable, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedian who taught us the truth about men's friendship
A similar description is shown by removing in other rows, especially when it is observed that men need to be opened is greater than ever and that the suicide rates of young men are higher than 15 years of age.
In 2013, suicide was a major death of 20-45-year-old men in Isosa-Britania. The suicide rate is three times higher than that of women.
Campaign Again Living Miserably (CALM) is responsible for the problem by announcing the 2015 year of men. The campaign seeks to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help.
Friendship is the basic idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2 000 people were questioned. According to the study, there are better opportunities to improve the risk of mental illness if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of the disease of the infected persons was also maintained if there were people who do not have mental health problems near them.
However, they are all fundamentally friendly.
The current communication domain is social media, and the message type is often more important. Fast reaction is often considered more important than important contacts.
There is a need for a strong, healthy and successful reflection of the digitalisation of life, even if it is true.
The future values, money, image and social status that will be associated with genuine success, all of which will take into account internal values and natural personal growth and friendship in our lives. Internal values will affect our mental health more closely.
One millionaires of a video game recently realized that money can't really buy happiness.
Freddie's beauty was that the line turned to the top of the point.
No one in the series was defined as a professional, but according to personality, this was seen in friendly relationships.
In the series, Joey and Chandler were presented humorously in the mood or watching a football game on TV. We also saw Ross often in the face of Rachel. It was clear that men were able to agree with this, even though they didn't even feel fully aware of it.
One volunteer explained this to me: "As I listened to the tired and self-immortal people, it has become clear to me how many of the smaller reactions of friends can be significant.
The men who communicate with us are often unable to talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men belong to dust is strong, and a man is easily considered weak if he speaks about his problems."
"Frend is one of the series where long-term survival mechanisms are presented.
In the series, the friendship between men was gradually strengthened.
Through the telephone, I can offer help from an unexpected moment outside, but long-term support will be received from friends and family through the close-up."
Comedy Central FriendsFest in honor of the series has been raised in life. If you participate in this week's event, please take your friends to Central Perki.
Or do something better... for a smile and a greeting if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
I never know how important a friendship relationship can be.
Comedy Central sends the entire Frienddit series – all 236 sections – #FriendsFest
Di Marian's husband helped the PSG cook Malmön.
Angel Di Maria announced a day against Malmö with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in the construction of the Mestres in the world and helped PSG to find the Russian team as Malmö aunts.
Read the video report and the score.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were at the time when Paris Saint Germain began his work on the Mesteria, during the late Malmön Parc des Princes Stadium.
Di Maria made a world when the Debity Game was played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of French meteors immediately at the reception. However, PSG has been able to add a number of places of land before the end could add to the lead: Cavani when the game was played 60 minutes.
The A section also contains Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong source against the Swedish methara. PSG not only aims to continue in the forest games, but it also wants to improve its position in the three remaining resorts.
Although SPG hit points, the reception was not a perfect demonstration of Laurent Blanc's trust team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic defeated the site and the man had to change when he had his previous home, where the man started his proper urine in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or neighborhoods, so 2 to 0 will give us a good foundation, even if we still have a harrowing edge," said Blanc.
"This knows well.
We made a win, and we were able to do it, to be sure we couldn't go to one or two extra countries."
After his release, Ibrahimovic returned to the band. The group had to meet him for a week in the 2nd and 2nd column of the League against Bordeaux. However, he left Ibrahimovic in his custody for four minutes.
In the last month of Manchester Uniteds of the PSG, the Argentina League was appointed a PSG solver, which will lead the group to a new level in Europe. He proved to be a valuable name in thanks to the pallo Marco Verratt's food of Malmö's defense and then set out to turn his own country back to the end of Johann Wiland.
However, those waiting for PSG's deadline had to be disappointed.
Malmö appeared in Celtici's boxing games, marched to the village at nine international level from the start. Five men's defense and two attackers' tactics were hard to overcome.
Nikola Djurdjic's curse went off the streets of Kevin Trapp's world in 34 minutes. The group didn't attack very actively.
Instead, PSG created a terrible famine and failed finalization, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five places in the first half of the world. Right at the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimavic ate the ground for the family of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed himself on his knees in food games. Ibrahimovic's diet of Di Maria shot the spinal cord at Willan's end in 52 minutes.
The second country was born in Greece because of Cavan. Six years ago, a game-played urguha shot a perfect shot when Ibrahimovic fed him on the left side of Maxwell's gun.
The Malmö bridge ended in another country, and only the Wiland's approach to the nearby town of David Luis had to be read in the square, and the Ezequiel Lavez was rejected at the very end of the road.
Malmö created Åge Hareide after acknowledging that PSG was his own class. "We played too much of the former Master's game last December.
Since then, we've only played in Sweden, where the level is not the same.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I'm sorry for the Parisians.
This was their trap."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion by share
A Swiss slave named Glencore, who tested the prices of raw materials, spent 2.5 billion dollars a week as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed in the London tax report, decided to sell new shares of about 1.6 billion dollars in order to reduce debt.
The company's market value dropped by 57 per cent this year. The company put pressure on raw materials prices when China's economy was affected by demand and market difficulties.
By the end of the share, Glencore's share of London's church had started in the middle of the week.
The share increased by 2.77% to 131.60 pounds in FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent.
Glencore announced last week that it was planning to contribute $2.5 billion as part of a strategy to reduce the debt of $30 billion to a third.
The company sold new shares of 125 pounds at a price of 2.4 per cent of the price of the shut-down price.
The company accounted for 1.3 billion shares, with a total of up to 9.99 per cent of the total group.
Concerned about the continuing economic downturn in China, the price has been higher to half when the price of coal, copper and other benefits has been 20 to 40 per cent.
White House to confirm Xi Jinpingin Washington
The White House, in its publication, confirms that President Xi Jinping is travelling to the United States by the end of the month.

"Monoty is seen in the role of the film, not in the role of the program," Damon said.
Brown had been shot in the face of a riot and a riot. "Well, of course it," the woman said after Damon's comment.
Damon and Brown had met with the other producers, Ben Affleck and Farrelly, to discuss the finals of the pie.
"Whoever is a leader, I would like to encourage you to think about how the Harmony myth is presented," Brown said on board.
"The only dark-blooded joke is prostituted, which makes sex attractive to her partner."
The producer of the Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Branccioto as film director. Damon strongly argued that the two choices could lead to an undisputed conclusion.
When the debate was presented on television, the social media broke down Damon’s negative comments.
The Twitter user Mr. Pooni said in conclusion: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks only of a dark person to explain what the multitude is is is is so much to promote whiteness that it makes it worse."
The tweets were distributed over 5,000 times, and it was loved 4,000 times.
Damon's comments are part of a time when a balanced representation of human beings in the media is shared.

A professional coach and an employee, Isaac Caldiero, takes the first American Ninja Warrior ticket on the day of the hit and buys a million dollars.
During the seven-year period, the TV series just concluded, the first time all of the work was carried out.
In the last section of the year, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten were able to find the last round.
In the last task, men had to climb from 23 metres up to 30 seconds.
In his first assignment, Britten found out that he was the first competitor to have performed at the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior.
Caldiero, after the German War, told E!News that he was still in shock after a million-dollar box.
"The amount of money is incredible, as I have never increased more than $10,000 in a year," he said in his E! questionnaire.
"I hope I can't even imagine what the future will be like."
The corresponding producer Kent Weed told The Hollywood Reporter’s book fine and why Britain does not pay, even though he was the first competitor who has solved all the tasks.
According to the rules, the prizes will soon be won.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, they will soon win," Weed explained.
"The reward is great and rewarding life, but Britten will also find satisfaction in doing so.
I don't think he's going to get hurt more than that.
He's just happy to do it.
He's got a lot of overcrowded on the tabs.
Britten is a great guy whose family is important.
His children and his wife treat him as a saint.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win himself, he just didn't want to win Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought of him the same if your situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed its eight-way route, which begins in May 2016.
Detroit Tigers is a winner of Minnesota Twins.
MINEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers has no special experience on the other side.
The best team in Baseball is now in the last place of the American League Central.
However, the team succeeded as a team at Minnesota Twins Target in the Field.
Twins lost his chance to raise Houston Astros to know how to fight the second wild card in the field.
Detroit returned, even though only one night, to the winning game, which has been on the other side of the stone.
"Every win is good, whatever it gets," said the Tigers team Brad Ausmus.
The tigers, Alfredo Simon, stood on his surface when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two days, six times in the sixth, and nine more in the afternoon.
Simon (13-9) ate 6 1/3 months of good game and saved three moves.
He's got three good start at nine o'clock.
"I just want to make a strong decision this year," said Simon.
"It's hard to throw anyone out of the game, so I want to eat up to six o'clock."
Victor Martinez received three pieces of paper and found two pieces of paper that were his first cuts after half of his career.
This was the first three pieces of Martinez after he received four pieces against Seattle Mariner on 6 July.
"He's got a good shot," Ausmus said.
"He looks good at the shootings and keeps the gun in the game."
After the seventh anniversary, Twins had the best chance of getting back to the game.
The Central Bishop of Byron Buxton started two steps a year on the left side of the page on the left-hand side of the ladder.
Right Captain Aaron Hicks won the bid, and Simon took two Brian Dozier for a year, who took three straight shots before his position was left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free ride to Mauer. As a result of the food chain's location, Miguel Sano found two pieces of sand. After him came the real Drew VerHagen.
When there were two players in the field, VerHagen got the third Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
Major League team conducted 27 times this way when Plouffe burned two players.
In the first round of the nine-year-old period, when Detroit had completed the eight-year-old course, the last of the Tigers, Bruce Rondon, was the last of two, and the situation was between 5 and 4.
However, the right diet fell into three direct diets and was able to maintain their group’s position.
You've benefited from the fact that Phil Hughes was in a little bit of trouble.
Tiggers received three courses on the first two days of the day against the right corner, which had just arrived from the list of broken ones back to the field. The man had been on the side for months because of a misunderstanding.
"At first, of course, it was not as I expected. But before I played, I felt more comfortable, and I was able to make a good meal and some good dinner on the third day," said Hughes.
In order to survive, Hughes gave one piece of shit to Ian Kinsler on the first day of the day.
On the day of the release of J.D. Martinez, Victor Martinez took the lead in the first journey.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 puke broke when the team was on the peas.
Third Nick Castellanos got the next one of his own, one of his own, but Victor Martinez was trying to move forward to the third.
Tiggers added the lead to the second round. Sipper James McCann found out that he had a share of his two daughters and Anthony Gose's unit, where the situation was between 3 and 0.
"Melky dog," commented Paul Molitor, a Twins valet.
"He didn't get very well, but he got a good job."
There was Hughes, who ate a three - minute meal that then changed him to his right seat at the A.J.
Hughes' saldox came in three steps, six o'clock, a free time, and four direct meals.
Note: The correct cuts of the tigers Annabal Sanchez were not included in the assembly because of the revision of the cap.
Consider Dr. James Andrews, who ran Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of broken down due to a revolution from the middle of August, and it was intended to be reached by midweek.
When Sanchez doesn't play, the left-hand cuts Daniel Norris removes from the list of losers and joins in the opening meeting against Twins.
Norris has been played from 1 to 1 in 4 since he was transferred to the left on the evening of 30 July at David Priceen.
He's been away from the meeting since August 20th because of the revision of the wine table.
Tigers and Twins will decide three games in their series Target in the Field in the middle of the week.
Norris (2-2, average: 4.43) is against Minnesota's right-wing cook Ervin Santanan (5-4, average: 4.33).
Xi urges us to open the economy to another world
"The financial system must open up to others to promote growth in the world," said President Xi Jinping as a poet at the meeting of the Economic Reform Steering Group.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and awareness-raising and developing a policy of opening up the economy," the president said at the 16th meeting of the Central Committee for the Strengthening of the Global Reform.
"The promotion of open-ended policies and the promotion of reforms will bring about a new point and will contribute to economic growth," Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted guidelines covering a negative list of market access, strengthening border control policies, promoting private capital income for state-owned enterprises and reviewing the system of citizens registration.
According to the Communication, the aim is to draw up a negative list of sectors and companies where investment is prohibited.
The system is tested gradually and is developed using test programmes.
According to the Communication, there is a significant change, as it gives the market a greater role to focus on resources, the transparency of business and the openness of markets based on law.
The government also facilitates the supervision of companies and wishes to ensure that companies have a decision on their own business.
According to the Communication, China has allowed new forms of cooperation across borders to be developed and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Through the opening up of the sectors in the state state, many industries open up to private investment.
"The government does not change its foreign investment policy, it supports the legal benefits of foreign-funded companies and provides them with better services," says the Communication.
In addition, the application for a permanent residence permit is optimised by requirements and by applying for a permanent residence permit.
