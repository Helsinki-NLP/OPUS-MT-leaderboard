I was as poor as you.
They were thinking about how to get him out of there.
I have a better idea.

I forgot the money on the night table.
The main city of the United States of America is Washington.

Chris doesn't like anyone.
Why didn't you call for help?
I couldn't stop laughing.
No one stood up.
You'll miss me when you leave.
He's eight years old.
Do you have these boots in my size?
Tom didn't see anything unusual.
Where are you from?
He saw him throw his waste into the forest.
I'll do it right now.
It was a huge and real puzzle.
I wish I hadn't been Tom.
Tom shouldn't just look at Mary's crying.
Look, there's a cat in the kitchen!
He can't do it on his own.
You were loved by this man for your wealth.
Call him, please.
Me and Tom are guilty.
You didn't have to eat that.
He said he saw her there.
If you need to press this button.
I guess you shouldn't eat that.
You still want to go with us next week to swim?
Almost anyone I know can swim.

The company shall complete its accounts at the end of the month.
Tea is one of the most popular hot drinks in the world.

But it's a shock!
If they think she made an idea of me, they're wrong.
Don't go too far.
I loved this place.
I don't know if that means anything.
I'm going to buy a new house.
That's all the money I got.
Georgian is probably one of the most difficult languages in the world.
Who could occupy Tom's place?
It was a hard test.
Tom's got a three-year-old dog.

I'm not going to work.
I think they like you.
We've been here all our life.
You're twice as strong as I am.
Tom's got a lot of work to do today, isn't he?
We're advertising our products on TV.
Go to the hospital.
Stop lying.
It's our decision.
He made an improvement proposal.
I'm learning from eight to one.
When you stick to Tom's instructions, nothing can happen to you.
I've been thinking a lot about you.
He's my brother's sister.
The problem is I don't remember where I parked the car.
She told him she hated the fire.
She said she's locked up.
Who's that writer?
It's like a bad dream.
This size is too big for me.
Then there was a host who continued to shine.
I had to protect them.
Do you like French wine?
I'd like to be your wife.
Tom's not used to city life.
Who's there?
I barely know Tom.
Tell me more about Tom, and you've got a fall.
I really have to run.
What are you doing tonight?
No one told me you were waiting for me.
She took the photo back to her place.
I'm almost out of the shadows, I'm fat, like a pig.
He doesn't like traveling by plane.
Tom's got a bad, strong voice.

We'll visit the Aquapark later.
We're very afraid of you.
Tom believes the moon's roads have been submerged.
So don't look.
What's in your coffee?
Tom's doing things I won't do.
Are you for his opinion or against him?
I told Tom not to give up.
Tom doesn't follow war movies.
You won't be alone.
I know it's a big demand.
Tom looks a little like Harry Potter.
They set up a new company in London.
He said he hated her.
He has to admit your mistakes.
They dragged her into a coma and raped her.
I told him what I think about him.
When are you moving into your new home?
I'm a black sheep family.
You're not going to miss anyone.
Mary cried while Tom was laughing.
You can't sell here.
I can't wait to see her again.
I was just ventilating.
Sometimes I play chess.
I don't know if I can handle it myself.
I don't plan on being here that long.
If they're late, give her this report.
I don't think I can answer that.
It looks funny.
I'm sorry I invited Tom and Mary to my wedding.
We have to fight alcohol.
He's snowing a lot in winter?
I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Is there something new?
What do you read about the book?
I can't sleep when the light shines.
I'm giving up!
She's still crying.

Women don't care about him.
They were in the shower.
I'm a little tired.
I believe Tom's right.
We have two children.
Finally, you understand everything.
Please write what he says.
It was a stupid idea.
The devil is in the details.
Do you like French wine?
A husband will be his wife.
Tom was my hero.
I've already started.
The time has come when we can travel to the universe.
Have you ever colored your hair?
My English is far from perfect.
Can you identify this man on the picture?
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.
Don't be a dream.
The loss of the work she loved so much for her was a wound.
Tom wants to talk to you.
Next picture.
A lot of people are going to study in the library.
He's sitting next to his brother.
It's a year before the wedding.
There wasn't a lot of girls there.
The brain structure is complex.

The kid's been crying all night.
You can spend the night with us.
Marie insisted she didn't do it.

I'm not used to this time.
Let's come here and give a ten-minute stop.
I don't like working in the garden.
What happened to you two?
I was born in Scotland.
I'm not that devout.

Push the button!
That big flower is blue.
Air conditioning is broken.
Does Tom do anything?
I can't do Russians.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Who would believe your story?
That's how your mother thought.
Tom made it.
I'd like to travel and visit a new place.
I really should have known.
Do you believe in love for first sight?
Is Tom on the line?

My sister started attending language school, and she's learning English there.
I'm not sure about that either.

Have you ever been abroad?
It was almost noon when Tom finally woke up.
Are we going to kill you?
It was over half an hour ago.
I'd like to know what's going on.

It's an important decision for me.

What am I going to do?
Wash your hands with soap.
Tom's still in the hospital.
It's good to see you.
We didn't know which bus we'd go to.

I'd rather go on a walk than wait for a bus.
I give priority to Czech food before those brought in.
I'll decide on my own.
The train went to the station.

I thought I changed my job.
I'm trying to find a new job.

Not all of this book likes it.
We only played one game.
You know enough.
We're on our way to war.
I don't have a diet anymore.
We haven't bought a wedding tree yet.
The best days are those we haven't met.
Looks like we're gonna have to do this.
Can you update my programs?

What did he want?
Let's say we didn't hear that.
I thought Tom was home and asleep.
He lost her.
The moon is beautiful on the ground.
You shouldn't wait here.

It hurts so much here.
I left you a cup of coffee in the office.
You remember?
Good luck with the accident.
That really doesn't make any sense, does it?

Everyone doesn't share that view.
I'm not working too long today.
Tom suggested we do it tomorrow.
I told Tom that Mary wants to borrow his almond.
"Liszt", the name of Hungarian composer Ference List, meaning "muk" in Hungarian.
Tom found his arm.
I'm going to the hospital today.
He died yesterday.

Better late than ever.
Now is the right time.
I'll give you five dollars.

She's not a good girl.
There's one way.

Last night, we got a glass of water from the water.
He's in Tokyo.
They're everywhere dark.

Talk about it.
What could I do better?
Where's Paris?
You speak English?
Please, don't forget to shut up before you leave.
It's the year she was here.
You're not the only one who's afraid of heights.
Last week, I wrote to Mr. Wood and asked him to give you a job on the farm.
She answered you.
Tom carefully checked the equipment.
We agreed that we should go through five-day working weeks.

I don't like her.
That table's hard.
I'm glad I learned that.

Nice to read.

I need to spit out my mouth.
That's what I'm thinking.
By limiting mass consumption, we can improve the environment.
She's lost.
This will teach her a lesson.

Talk for yourself.

I'm a musical producer.
Tom must get out of there as soon as possible.
He was surprised to hear that message.
You shouldn't have told Tom that.
Remember when you last saw Tom?
Mr. Umemura is teaching us English.
Shut up.
The property is a theft.
Tom set up a seed and then waited until he was grown.
I'll go buy it.
The rooms are in the dark.
Why don't you explain all this to Tom?
I hate the fact.
We're touched by what you are.
I just said I need air.
Are you kidding me?
My older sister is about a year older than his wife.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I don't want to go back.
They don't want us back.
People should look for themselves first.
Tom seems tired.
It's me.
You can change it if you want.
What's the perfect outside temperature for you?
It's not too much to see.
All citizens have the same rights in democracy.
In his essay "Esperanto: European or Asian language" Claude Piron showed the similarities between an expert and a Chinese, which concluded that Esperanto is a purely euro-centred one.
You haven't done it yet.
I wish people had stopped hating each other.
Tantal is a chemical first with Ta's sign.
He's got nine lives.
How could you do this to me after everything we've been through?
Why would Tom leave?
My doors are always open.
I bought two crates.
You didn't hurt anyone, did you?
Be careful about this child.
Would you like that?
I'm paying for the coffee.
Don't lose hope.
That's not how I feel.
Tom helped Mary.
Call her tomorrow.
I didn't see that.
Tom and Mary were spies.
They're playing at home.
I don't know why I'm still in trouble.
I'm not as efficient as I used to be.
Tom's dog had a few blinds.
Don't forget Tom's blind.
Mary seemed to be a ghost.
No disputation against taste.
When Tom came home tonight, he found out that there was no dinner on him anymore.
He knows it.
They must be very proud of their daughter.
Tom took the transport and Mary got out on the other side.
One's gone.
He started explaining what happened.
Tom's got lithium ice cream, he can eat almost anything.
Mom didn't know what to do with her son.
He knows wine.
Tom felt like someone put his arm on his shoulder.
You know who the parents are?
No word will show you how amazing you are.
I'd like to have a dinner party.
Will it burn tomorrow?
The cuneiform text found in Sumery was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I like summer, but I can't keep that winter.
Of course it is!
Mary likes you.
What are you giving?
What's TATOEBA?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a symmetric guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
Before the meal, you had your dirty hands washed.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left it on the desk with a high-fashioned desk.
It's not over the beer line after the whole day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I'm still at peace with my work.
You really need help?
Be you, I'll ask him.
Let it be for us.
I got a map here.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting, even though they invited me.
Are you still here?
I thought you were going with Tom.
I've got to get out to the next station.
That dream was what I liked about.
You must have paid a lot for him.
It's obviously a lie.
Right, then transport and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have no food in the refrigerator?
It was just an accident.
I'll still have to call you.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be 30 seconds later.
Put that mass on the thin plates.
I can't see what life is like.
Do everything in your power.
I'm only buying soft toilet paper.
Yeah, you have to.
We've gone to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
I'm so happy about that.
It's not easy playing on the faggot.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is Russia's main city.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom was wrong about the subject.
We're drinking a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't behave yourself.
The old habits are fast disappearing today.
Tom's still got a lot of work to do.
You'd better get out of here right now.
Tom's safe.
Nice to read.
We've made that move.
I don't like to hurt you, I just came to apologize.
Tom can't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
He had to stop the train because he was lying on a fallen tree next door.
What did Tom call for the tax?
He's an ideal husband to me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in the 17th century.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
With great effort, he went out on a tree.
Translating Czech text is very difficult.
Tom's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom's gone too.
We already know that, Tom.
I'm glad you warned me.
I left this morning.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We were running the manager on the floor in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills qualify him for this job.
They're falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom couldn't tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They don't help.
I like it's a tie.
We didn't lead ourselves as well as we wanted.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you date Joana?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The area is covered with black darkness.
I need more than you.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
You gave Tom a glass.
What should I do in this situation?
You're driving to school with a train?
Tom won't be at school today.
I'm hurting Tom.
Who's Tom visiting?
It could be Tom, not Mary.
What if you'd invite me to the locker?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I don't know exactly what Tom bought.
There's another question.
He won't surprise me when that happens.
He's free.
These people don't usually say.
Ask your mother.
Tom had his feet washed thoroughly.
Did you eat this morning?
Jana was as happy as she was when she got the recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time in his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you were to help us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's visiting his uncle.
Everybody's out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you the autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in such a place?
It's been two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Did you ever sing in French?
I'm used to this cold time.
The Americans were surprised by the Germans.
There's not enough cross in the conference room.
That's not happening anymore.
I told Tom that he was a false friend and he got hurt.
I'm working on it.
This bridge was a paid bridge.
He's stuck on it.
I came to school late this morning.
I've been involved in this retreat.
I went to bed on my own.
We shot at a mine in the river.
Tom never had a hard drink.
Tom's not working.
My heart is French, but my background is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom fell to Mary's hand.
I'm just so happy.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played with Mary tennis last night.
What's your dad's name?
They've got half the walls set up here.
I talked to him in English and found out I could talk to him.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
This plane is clean.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Nurser, you're gonna regret it.
You're out of your mind.
We should celebrate.
All the answers must be written according to instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
You brought this book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced with her.
I bought one bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
What are you?
Have you done that?
There was no doubt about it.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
If I know, she's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Put yourself in there and you'll see it better.
He's too old to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom's got on us, we were able to keep a smile.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
It's better to be dead than to live.
They agreed that the wedding was delayed.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he's saying.
The wedding happened last week.
I still have it.
The horse's red.
I owe Tom a debt.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my promise.
I'm no longer such a palace.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary doesn't have to talk to anyone, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the tower.
Try talking to the police.
You like snakes.
I don't want to change anything.
Barman, I'll have something to drink.
Do you like balls?
She was bigger.
I guess he went home.
I was in the woods.
Tom got drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd rather go back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know it's nice.
I'm not going to school on Sundays.
He owns his own house.
I don't usually do that tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can manage it on our own?
I was waiting for them to tell the truth.
Put it under the bed.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's gone.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Take that balloon tom.
I'll attack her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I'd be a better man.
You're stealing, huh?
Tom must be involved.
You should consult a lawyer first.
You're a good journalist.
That's what Tom used to do.
I love this book.
It's all over again.
When I came home from work, I found out that someone stole our apartment.
Read that book.
This was a bakery.
My father's holding a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like some movies.
This works.
Let's get out of here.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not calm.
Can this report be true?
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
You remember seeing me?
I want to help, but I'm currently confused.
Without her help, I'd never put up with this test.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Can you turn from French to English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to go swim with us.
Oh, my God, Tom, what's going on with this bag?
The promise seemed like an intrusion.
If you need more information, please don't hesitate to call me.
When you come here, I'll be asleep.
I don't know how old Tom is.
I'd like you to come with me.
I told Tom it wasn't over yet.
Judy likes him.
Tom and Mary met John.
Please don't do this.
You'll be happy again.
The kid's gone after four.
Tom doesn't take his medication.
"Didn't you see my cell phone?" "It's on the table."
Tom went to his locker.
The first jump went wrong.
Well, let's go eat.
We should give him a gift.
In England, the reader asked us, "How many beer would you give yourself, half paints, or the whole?" Because we had no idea how much it could be, we asked him to show us the conclusion.
I'll tell Tom to cut you off.
I've got a better English than a song.
I like fish.
They're all screaming.
Tom's parents supported him during his study.
She sells a sense of morality.
If you have any trouble, don't bother to come after me.
He's cruel and uneducated, and people take him away.
He killed Lailo himself.
You're an asshole.
He's too confident.
The companies may have to leave some employees.
He didn't run fast enough to pull the train.
I used to work here.
I'm hungry.
He met a lot of wonderful people himself.
No one lives here.

He visited Japan when he was president.
I knew Tom would laugh.
That shirt needs to win.
He's not alone anymore.
I doubt it.
Tom's unaccompanied.
I don't know how I should behave.
Tom's still a young man.
I could get used to living here.
They wanted to sell the house.
You know how to use it?
Your daughter's tough.
Pedro doesn't speak Russian.
Come on, or you won't hit the train.
It's a little bit more hope.
Where was I when I needed most?
I went for a week without food.
You're on my way.
Press that button.
The loss is the cause of death.
Who won this contest?
My patience has its limits.
You're learning Irish as yourself?
I have to go to the pool.
I don't know how to read between the order.
It's as high as you are.
What's wrong with me?
Dad's a drug.
My father doesn't allow me to go out alone at night.
It's making candles.
Don't try to live forever.
It wasn't as easy as I thought.
She brought you something.
Why don't you just give Tom a kiss?
He's drunk.
He threatened to kill her if she didn't listen to him.
I'd like to be in Paris now.
You remember that?
I live in Turkey.
I don't want to disappoint my friends.
Mary's a very busy woman.
I don't know anything anymore.
Cold and yellow, we finally got guests.
It doesn't matter, does it?
Can't you bring me a blanket?
You're a good cook, aren't you?
I just wanted to say thank you.
Who's gonna pay for it?
Don't give up hope.
She wasn't cold.
Tom asked Mary to make him a coffee, Mary told him to make him alone.
They asked if they should write a new dictionary.
He's making lunch in the garden.
Many people don't like hospitals.
Would you give me a milk bowl?
You read that magazine when you were waiting for Mary to show up.
My name is Ivan.
I'll never get used to it.
I want to be famous.
It's not the size it depends on, it's the way to use it.
Looks familiar.
Don't tell me if you need anything.
I've done it already.
Tom has three older brothers.
He lives for glory.
I burned my fingers on the yellow shirt.
Tom forgot the money at home.
We've already done our job.
I don't want to wait anymore.
Tom said we need more jobs.
What a beautiful spirit!
You've forgotten.
Where's Dad?
How were the bombs fired?
Tom said Mary shouldn't try to do this on her own.
Tom was wearing a white shirt.
I think you could help me.
Can you update our programs?
He can't eat. He just ate.
Tom's going to Boston next summer.
Let me help you.
Tom didn't know where to go.
Tom didn't know if it was the truth.
Go fast, or the bus will catch up with you.
I know it's hard to see.
Give me the knife.
I thought Tom would do it for us.
You have to finish it.
Get out of your mouth.
And history has always changed.
Swimming and cutting the tops.
It's a message from a man.
Sometimes I feel like we're a bunch of burrans.
I'm almost twice as old as you.
There's no one in the office right now.
How can I sacrifice in something I don't believe in?
Who wants another piece of cake?
It's too early to go to sleep.
Tom's been waiting a long time.
What if we ask Tom?
I was very upset.
He liked her red hands.
Tom's explanation wasn't very good.
I don't want to go to school.
Make sure you don't get into a bad bus.
He visited Mary in the hospital.
I can't live alone.
All these three beautiful girls are my fault.
Try this!
I loved you more than anyone else ever loved you.
You want me to put it on the table?
He's her.
I'm not allowed to go.
You can rely on him.
You lost your head, see?
Tom's building the wall.
He was tired and so he went to bed fast.
Why do people fear you?
Tom likes animals.
This car needs repair.
I'm talking to you like a friend.
How do you look?
The integrity of young people is supported by violent movies and computer games.
Some criminals will remain undeterred.
Tom likes cheese.
That won't wait anymore.
I don't deserve your friendship.
Tom was jealous.
I can't leave you.

I'm back where it belongs.
What's that for?
Would you like one?

I wish I'd been more in love.
My uncle gave me a book.
I'm a novelty in this job.
I should've continued.
Why wouldn't anyone want to talk about it?
I'd like to be as young as you.

They're afraid of me.
It was my duty to do it.
Do you really want to stay young forever?

We'll have to find a new place soon.
You're always worried about your husband.

Let's go out.
I've got some inspiration.
Did you see my pen?
Marie is Tom's own sister.
Mary's more honest than Tom.
You're doomed to this judgment.
Don't say hop until you jump.
Can't you help Tom?
