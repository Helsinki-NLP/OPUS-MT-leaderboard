I'm just practicing to look nice when I'm naked.
I need to break your neck.
I owe him a lot to Tom.
I owe Tom for this.
I paid a fine.
I'm planning to skip the lunch.
I'm planning to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I love dogs more than cats.
I'm more like a goat cheese than a cow.
I prefer eggs from underpants.
I prefer black.
I'd like to sit down more.
First I'd walk alone.
I'm sure I sound funny.
I promise you I won't do anything that's gonna hurt you.
I hit him with a box in his pocket.
I pressed the button to insert the radio.
I drew the word Alice to highlight it.
I've proposed it.
I put you three cupcakes in your tea.
I've opened the box.
I refused to smoke too much.
I gave up.
I'm looking at the stock.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like wine.
I like your website very much.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would be really nice to shut up.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize a guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the queen.
I hate his bad attitude.
I respect your decision.
I cried out one.
The iron is stronger than the gold.
Isaac Newton died as a girl.
I said I'd bring him.
I said maybe he'll turn around.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Did he miss anything?
I've seen a ghost.
I saw an unidentified flight object.
I saw her a week ago.
I saw him right now.
I saw how he plays cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister filming the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sunflower in the mill.
I saw Tom do that.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far?
Buddhism Is Religion or Philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Is it caloric?
I don't see a contract here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Are you all happy?
Is everyone having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat apples or bananas?
I'm slowing down with my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry about them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack up.
I have to go get dressed.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have believed her.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should apologize.
I should look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I was supposed to be a teenager.
I should've checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed you my room.
Are you out there?
Is it done?
Is it far away?
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I got him a sleigh.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping in chairs.
I slept like a swear.
I slept in the couch.
I slept in the bus.
I broke the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholics?
I laughed.
Isn't that exciting?
Isn't it possible for Tom to do this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this too much?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning the snow.
Is he a cab driver?
It's pregnant or just fat?
Is it really so beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I've been sneezing in the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I found something strange.
Is that what Tom is doing?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there anything like that?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that what I'm saying?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Does Tom think that happened?
Did you do that to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
That's why you don't want to help him?
That's why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is it hot coffee?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is he paying for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there a sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there something specific that you want to see?
Is it a word about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this where this is?
Is he really a diamond?
Is that necessary?
Is this right in English?
This is Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this a place free?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your turn or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still don't believe Tom's gone.
I still don't believe it.
I still don't understand.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love horses.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom aware?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Does Tom die of cancer?
Is Tom having fun?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Are you looking for them, Tom?
Are you angry, Tom?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You're talking, Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped focusing on Tom.
I burned a cube in the dark.
I'm learning the history of art.
I felt so old right away.
I'm trying to get rid of the asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on the demand for exit from the pipeline.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to get up.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I doubted.
I'm assuming Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't even touch you if I burned you and you were the last cup of water.
I wake up every day.
Does the freeze still work for you?
Is your head full of shame?
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
I'm being chased by Italian police.
I talked to my advisers about what I was going to take.
That whole thing makes sense.
Looks like it's okay.
It always happens the same way.
There can't be any chance.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
It's for you now.
He did much more than I expected.
Never, but never, never could that happen here.
There's no way he was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It's not that bad.
That disappointed him.
It'd look good.
Don't interrupt me.
It won't be better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to do it anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like they know what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I'm giving Chinese.
I'm learning English.
It's my taman.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to do with it.
It had to be done.
It must have been created somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's gone.
There's no connection to happiness.
It wasn't easy for us.
There's a sensitivity value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think something's hiding?
I think I can.
I think I might be used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one.
I think I'm pregnant.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to prevent it from happening again.
I think I'm going to eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he is.
I think I love you.
I think I'm pretty clear.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to cook.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I need to watch Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I'm pretty good speaking French.
I think it's risky without any help.
I think it would be best to stay here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time to go.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I realized how much time we should go.
I think I'm wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think he's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's crazy.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's out of breath.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's great.
I think Tom's serious.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's bad.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's a little girl.
I think Tom's a cuppy.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's cursed.
I think Tom's busy.
I think Tom's a good-looking guy.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're ready.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we ate enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you'll have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you've panicked.
I think you're making the problem worse.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think she needs you to pick her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you're helping me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle a long time ago.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think I need you to finish with this.
I think it's done enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all the money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was my cause.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom's gone well.
I thought Tom went to retirement.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was coming from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
So we didn't agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd stay here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a job at the goose.
So you didn't want the reward?
I thought you found another one.
I thought you lost your hand clock.
Don't you hate him?
I felt tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought maybe you'd be interested in finding out.
I thought you were just dating girls who were lower than you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you know how to swim?
So you didn't say you wanted to go with us?
I thought you'd better play chess than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you wouldn't be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
I'm so sorry to be here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the hat off the chair.
It's a multifaceted process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish the job one day.
It's less comfortable today than yesterday.
It's not that easy.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
He's not coming in.
They say the old hat is broken.
He begins to lead us into thinking that we cannot ignore the natural world.
It's hot since yesterday.
It's worth quoting a famous passport of his essay.
He's writing on his head.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong with me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
He looked funny.
You look right.
It looks very delicious.
It looks different.
I seem familiar.
It looks like eggs.
Looks like I've been drinking too much yesterday.
It looks like the two of them are back in the relationship.
It looks like the two of them were calm.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas anniversary.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
Get me out of here.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
Maybe it sounded like a proposal, but the order was.
Maybe he'll be late tonight.
Maybe he's acting weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it's not just an accident.
It's possible he's coming back today.
It must have been her.
I'm sure I'm surprised.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told him when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it'd be hard to figure out.
I told you my father died when I was 13 years old.
I told you this would be a big deal.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I slept.
I'm back with the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants were removed.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I fully understand.
It's probably not worth waiting.
He came back two days ago.
He's been having a lot of trouble.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to make him come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend I'm something I'm not.
I'm really sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to fuck up.
He's ready to turn.
That's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is recommended that you check if any negative effects are associated with the use of alcohol while you are taking the prescribed medication.
It's a kid's game.
That's a good system.
Everything is in the file.
Everything's in the room.
It's all over.
It's over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's so weird.
It'll be done a little bit more.
It's gonna be a little late in Boston.
It's almost summer.
You're gonna have to go with her a little bit more.
It's fun.
It's already seven hours.
It's already eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's great what you've been through.
It's good to see you.
There's nothing to think about.
It's too bad you've ruined yourself.
It's about integrity.
It's an intelligent compromise.
That's a fake trace.
It's a risk plan.
It's too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
It's coming fast.
It's just a job.
It's a special cause.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a beautiful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
It's locked up.
It's just my mom brought it to me.
He's been back for a week, up-down.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week's extremely hot.
It would be best not to speak that way.
It's better to be alone.
It's better to be an optimist and be more careful than to be a pessimist and be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's the new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
Study here.
It's generally known that it's not your dear Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
They're definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his abilities.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad for them to fly.
It's ten o'clock.
That's what happened before.
It's very rare.
That's right.
It's fair.
To protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
Get dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's going to be wild.
It's gonna be crazy.
It'll happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's a good training.
It's okay.
It's improved.
It's very fun.
It happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
He's hot here in hell.
That should be possible.
It shouldn't take a long time for this.
I don't care what you think about Tom.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just kidding.
A simple question is where.
It's just invented.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of skin.
I'm making a decision, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's beautiful and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to wear such gifts.
It's nice to feel you need someone.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's funny here.
It's not your job!
It's not secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not nice.
It's not back.
That's not what happened.
It will not be easy to do that without great help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just cheating.
It's not usually a pencalo.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not that we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not over yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It doesn't matter to you.
It doesn't happen very often to buy a $1,000 hat.
It's not worth much.
Snow fell last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
It sounds very strong.
Sounds very good.
Our job is to help them.
It's white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably right.
He probably still has it.
It's probably still available.
It's a doppelganger.
Actually, it's very often.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm not right.
Somme may not help us at all.
It's just that.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's the real damage.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's a law!
It's so obvious that we don't need any evidence.
It's starting to get stuck.
It's still dark out there.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's not okay yet.
It's growing.
It's still there.
It's weird how people in tropical areas eat the food that's closed like a carri.
It's stuck.
His surface was as flat as it looked.
It's time again.
This is the best smell I've ever tasted.
It's a pajac trap.
I'm so scared.
It's time to take a job.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them at their level of choice.
It's strong.
It's shit.
It's wrong through.
He's not holding the heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unusual.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom soon.
It's very common.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot here.
I don't care.
There's a wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's your question, Tom.
It's yours.
The water needs only three minutes to shut down.
It's been all night.
He's been more than I thought he'd be.
I needed a long time to get rid of those ants.
Looks like you're an unexpected beauty story.
I included the ventilator and put it in the wall.
I included the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I rejected Tom.
It was a great honor to be asked to keep the talk.
It was so beautiful.
That was the shame.
It was about midnight.
This was an orange day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
He was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing night.
It's been a while.
It was a terrible sight.
I was honored.
That was a offer I couldn't refuse.
It was my pleasure to spend the night with a wise, spiritual, and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
That kind of behavior was childish by him.
It was nice.
It was working.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
It was fun last night.
It's been a night.
He was starving.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a beautiful gift.
It was kind of nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been shown that dogs â€™ pain is higher than those who live on cats.
It was so great.
That was funny enough.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really tricky.
It was a lot of noise.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
Seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to go to the mountains.
It was so obvious.
It was awful.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's stuck on the needle.
It was Tom.
It was too much.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unintelligent.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very boring in that room because all the windows were closed.
It was Peter.
It was worth trying.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
There's nothing you can do to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't help you.
It's good.
It would be very normal to be mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk tomorrow if I can explain everything to you.
I need you right now.
I've been watching you before.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I've already written everything she was supposed to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always been mad at Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
He's always helped me.

Women like men with arms.
That's great!
No one wants to sit with you?
The tree leaves.
It's not a shame.
Secrecy's a waste of energy.
Would he lie to you?
If I don't invite Tom to my party?
Wouldn't that hurt?
Aren't you gonna start cooking hair from that?
Would you lie to Tom?
Would he like that tom?
Would you do me a favor?
Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Would you like a dog?
Would you like a mental bomb?
Would you like me to come with you?
Would you like some more bread?
Would you like a cup of tea?
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Would you like to watch TV?
Can you check those?
Can you send a message to Tom?
Could you take off your cigarette?
Would you put this in my car?
Can you speak clearly?
Would you take part in this event?
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Nice, it's really late.
Look at this.
Oh, well, that's great.
Look!
Write your birthday.
Write it on Tom.
If it were, it would be fixed... when the worm was born.
Yeah, bring me a cup of coffee.
Yeah, anyway.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
Yes, my angels.
Yeah, and?
Yeah, huh?
I prepared a cake with a cake last night.
I came here yesterday.
It was hot yesterday, but it's tough today.
Yogota comes from India.
You all look so busy.
You always forget.
You always misunderstand me.
You're always leaving the right whale.
You and I will fly with the same plane.
You don't seem to know how painful it is to kiss you.
You're a good cook.
You're beautiful.
At the same time, you are hard and easy, and nice and hot; I can't even live with you without you.
You're drunk!
You're my friends.
You're my lucky one.
You're my pride and my joy.
You're not a Japanese.
You're not a Canadian.
You're not invited.
You're not following.
You're one of us.
You're too proud of the pool.
You're under oath.
Let's go.
He's here before them.
You asked me to help.
You're throwing bread in your ovens.
Win her.
You borrow books.
You can ask me what you want.
You can ask them yourself.
You can ask Tom.
You can avoid such problems if you have these advice in mind.
She can trust her.
You can kiss me, beat me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never hide my mind.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
It's easy to get to know Tom because he's so tall.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
Now you can go, sir.
You can go and stay as you like.
You can get out of here.
You'll find out.
You can deal with this.
You can take mine.
You can recognize children's voices without problems.
You can make your job easier.
You can rest.
Now you can sit down.
You can stay in here.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
You can study here.
You can rest.
You can talk later.
You can't beat me.
You can't call them.
You can't control me, Tom.
You can't do that.
You can't do that.
You can't do what's going to happen to you.
You can't let her go.
You can't let him go.
You can't help us now.
You can't just leave the baby.
You can't leave Boston today.
You can't let that happen.
You can't marry Tom.
You can't prove anything.
You can't sell it.
You can't sit there.
You can't take that away from me.
You can't treat me like this.
You can use my car.
You can use this car.
You can use this pen.
You're quick to get the data.
You're making a mess with hooks.
Maybe you're wrong.
You could have refused.
You'd be a great mother.
You better ask them first.
To find them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do that.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
She deserved better.
And you're going to make it to me.
You've done a bad job.
You've done your job well.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was a peder?
You didn't listen.
He didn't see anyone coming in, did he?
You didn't tell me it wasn't okay.
I told Tom about it, didn't I?
You already did that.
He gave it all to himself.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't want fish.
They're sick, aren't they?
Don't you have an accident key?
You don't know how long it's been.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
You know my curve.
You don't know anything.
You dream you know.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You don't have to be present for this.
You don't have to go.
You don't have to panic.
You don't have to dress up anything ridiculous.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do anything to remind them that you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You're not working here.
You're driving me crazy.
Forget your wound!
You scared Tom.
He gave Tom the list, didn't he?
You're entitled to a phone call.
You're going to collect Tom and come back.
You hit one.
You're not right, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair's full.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job.
You're in danger of conscience, aren't you?
You have a habit that I don't like.
You have a little town.
You have beautiful lips.
You were a great mentor to me.
You were busy.
You have a lovely eyes.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
I respect you.
You don't know how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You don't think so, do you?
You didn't see that, did you?
You don't have a problem with him, do you?
You've got a really good manuscript.
Mikey's your hands.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to leave.
You have to be present.
You have to keep away from him.
You can't lose your condition.
You have to try, Tom.
You've got a lot of nice lips.
You've got a lot of broken eyes.
You just heard.
Just get back from the rest.
You missed him for a while.
You missed Tom for a while.
You don't get involved in this.
Children, you're here to stay.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you do.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're quick to learn.
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Leave me alone.
You let Tom escape.
You love your life, don't you?
You'll be all right.
You'll be confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be known in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
It'll be better for you.
You'll get them back.
They're gonna make you weak.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You're going with me and a point!
That's why you're gonna have to ask him.
You're gonna have to learn the next year.
You'll have to talk to Tom about what you're waiting for him to do.
You'll need a map to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never take you to that club.
You're never gonna hit.
You'll never know.
You'll know when it's time.
It looked beautiful.
You look familiar to me.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look so good.
You look sad, what's wrong?
You look mindy.
You look very nice, Tom.
You've earned something.
He gave a word.
You're distracting me.
Maybe you'll need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad for you to slow down.
I met my sister, didn't I?
Maybe you can help them.
You must be careful.
You must be confused.
You must be very relieved.
You must have jumped.
You must be very proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show yourself first.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You have to beat the kid.
You can't give up.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
You have to learn valuable.
You need a friend.
You need a good woman.
You need to buy some sugar.
You need to do it somewhere else.
You need to make him listen.
You should grow up and grow up a little.
You need to help her.
You need to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to do this to work.
You have no question why.
He didn't give them a chance.
We only have one life.
One's a life.
You need to make a habit of mixing your teeth every meal.
You need to go to a dentist.
You owe me nothing.
You pay me very well.
You've made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a kidnapper.
He's gone to the red.
He ran as fast as he could.
You're burning your car.
You're burning your car.
Your complaints upset me.
Your sins have scattered the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are welcome, but we're silent.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real human being.
You're acting weird.
You're pregnant.
You're a traitor.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a human being.
You're all scared.
You're all the same.
It really does.
But she was lying to her.
You really need a psychiatrist.
You really should have let me call a cab.
You're always tired.
You're a moron.
You're nobody and nothing.
You're a pig.
You're a prisoner.
You're a racist.
You're very brave.
You're an old man.
You're an intelligent man.
You're a wise man.
You're bad.
You're busy, aren't you?
You're capable, but you're forgetting.
You're smart, aren't you?
You're hungry.
You're unorganized.
You're bad and you're disgusting.
You're experienced.
You're right.
You're beautiful.
You're free.
You're a faggot.
You'll need help.
You'll need this.
You're gonna be okay with this.
You're in the middle of the night.
You hurt me.
You're not telling me.
You're impressive.
You're right now.
You're in power.
You're incapacitated.
You're powerful.
You took my place.
You're not in any danger.
You're interested.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
I'm tired of something.
You're lucky I'm not late.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me, I can know.
You're beautiful.
You're disturbing Tom.
You're my family.
You're not my friend.
You're not so young anymore.
You're not a monster.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're under her level.
You're under his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that scary.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
You're not so old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
Now you can go.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You don't have alcohol anymore.
You have too much work.
You're specific.
You're part of our team.
You're a poet.
You're poor.
You're predictable.
You're a tough city.
You're absolutely safe.
You're really nice.
You're a nice guy.
You're so lucky.
You're kidding.
You're funny.
You're uncultivated.
You're too slow!
I'm very attracted to you.
You're very dramatic.
You're very useful.
You're very stressed.
You're so negative.
You're a little uneducated.
You're kind of gross.
You're such an asshole.
You're so talented.
You're stronger than Tom.
What a bubble.
What a pig.
You need to help them.
You're embarrassing me.
You're scared.
You're the only one who can laugh at me.
You're the only one who met Tom.
You're the owner.
You're the prisoner.
You're the problem.
You're weak.
You're ruining your whole life.
You're too smart for that.
You're not trusted.
You're upset.
You're very smart.
You're very good with kids.
You're so lonely.
You're very direct.
You're very sweet.
You're very cut.
You can wait here for free.
You're a friend.
You're with Tom, right?
You misjudged her.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're lying, Tom.
The bears look strange to you.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smelled like spring.
You're getting too tight when you're scratching.
Your health is very important to me.
Your house is very beautiful.
It's good for you to remember.
Your month is coming back.
Your mother put your knee in the top fioc.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your way is hard.
Your doctor must be written in English.
Your answer is up-down right.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith is precious.
Your role here is so important.
Your police are full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's sleeping.
Your sons are quite comfortable.
All your stuff is here.
Your wishes are my order.
It's your patent.
That's what he said an hour ago.
You told me to call whenever.
He told you we'd never catch her.
He told you you'd help.
He said you'd write me a message tonight, but he'd put me out, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look deorientated.
I guess you already know the answer.
You look like you're studying.
There's an infection in the Bible.
I guess it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in the book?
You need to ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Be careful not to go too far.
You should be happy for them.
You should be proud.
You need to eat less red meat.
You need to eat more.
You need to feel comfortable.
You need to sleep well.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.
You need to go and help him.
You should get up early.
You just need to talk to Tom.
You need to pay your rent in advance.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
You should try it.
You should try this.
You should try to write a letter of respect.
You should have asked her first.
You should wear a helmet while you drive the engine.
You should write him a letter of gratitude to Tom.
You smell like shit.
You sound like you're relieved.
You sound very sure.
You've turned your ass off.
You're so beautiful.
You're really talking a lot.
You're talking too much about Boston.
You think it's weird just because it's not white.
The old man!
You two are very sweet together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're in the back.
They're burning you.
You've experienced a traffic accident, but you'll be fine.
Thank you very much.
It was of great benefit to us.
You've been right since.
You've done white again!
You bought something for Mary.
I'm sorry.
Win them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
It's too late!
You've got a chip.
You're kind of worried.
You got me wrong.
I promise.
Now you have, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You've ruined Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been holding this off for a long time, and it's got to be done tonight.
You saw what I could do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky they survived the attack.
You're wrong.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom was right.
He was driving fast.
It was great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
He wasn't right about the picture.
You'll do as I tell you.
You'll find your toys and books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You're too busy for him.
You wouldn't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm mad.
