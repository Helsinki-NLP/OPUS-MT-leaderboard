UN Chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts for almost five years, and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations has again asked all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban expressed its concerns during a conference that intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the council - USA, Russia, China, England and France - at the side of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional forces "did this unsolved situation".
Ban asked the five remaining members to prove their solidarity and unity when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, addressing such a crisis in Syria.
8 numbers of polls showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a 'flip-flop' politician.
Others called him a joke.
And the others are waiting for the implosion.
However, regardless of how some Republicans try to give Donald Trump of the polls, he did not work (even).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads a percentage of two digits and some voices begin to question what this means for the chances of the real estate mollusc numbers.
Of course, it's still too late.
None of these say that Trump will win the race for the nomination of the republics.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made Herman Cain's place in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination course.
And the reasons why it would be hard to fight in general elections are numerous.
But foreign groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservation group Club for Growth recognize Trump's power and begin to support him with money.
We continue to present some figures from recent surveys suggesting that the real estate mollusk is not just something that goes on:
The figures indicating Trump's support returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his application, in mid-June, a poll conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 republics had a positive view of the real estate movement.
By mid-July, the percentage had dropped by 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six of the 10 republics have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 claim to have a negative opinion.
These numbers are kept.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination course.
In a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of the Republicans stated that they would be "intuismate" or "thank you" if Trump won the nomination course.
Only two of the 10 states would be "fashioned" if Trump won the nomination course.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% claim to be "intuismate" to 40% who declares the same thing about Trump).
The closest thing about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "unthankful" or "favored" if favorite Jeb Bush won the nomination course.
Most republics do not consider Trump's temperature to be a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for the insults brought and his bombistic style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level consider that the real estate mollusc has the right temperature to be president, according to ABC News/Washington Post's monthly poll.
We have the same figures in the state of Iowa, where 52% of the Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be leader, according to the order made last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that he does not have the personality necessary to act effectively and almost six of the 10 independent individuals claim that his temperature does not have what he is looking for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When I take intellectuals into my mind, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, at the question of who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination course, four of the 10 said that Trump.
The situation changed to the end of July, when four of 10 would be equal to Jeb Bush.
Complete information: in the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
During the same period of the last elections, four of the 10 republics elected Rick Perry in the nomination course, just 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP members consider Trump’s campaign to be a joyous one.
Even if the Republicans or respond to another candidate, the trumpet is still in front of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will probably contribute to the victory of Trump, while support against Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
But a survey launched at the beginning of September of the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and the majority of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is located at 13 points from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and, lastly, 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win?
Ben Carson would beat the man of business with 19 points in an hypothetical confrontation between one and the other.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll made on Tuesday shows that over half of the members supporting Trump declare that they do not change their vote option.
Obviously, many can happen in this sense and no one can say that they will never argue.
46% claim that it lets the port open the possibility of changing the option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently the Ben Carson neurosurgery, but it is twice as likely as the members who claim they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six of the 10 republics claim to agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump has called immigrants from Mexico "violators" in the opening speech of his campaign, two months later, immigration was the central subject of the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombistic style will lead to a scandal between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will undermine the rebending efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, six of the 10 republics claim to agree with Trump on migration.
So, it seems as long as the problem of immigration remains in the light of reflectors, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration in front of authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of the Republican voters, largely due to their foreign status.
According to ABC/Post, six of the 10 republics claim that they prefer a political outsider in the destruction of someone with experience in government.
People are also angry with the Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four republics of Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans of the Congo, 54% saying "unthankful" and 21% "nervous".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
From his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs was long expected
The new leader of the Laburist Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later take the lead at the Prime Minister's Questions, meeting for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions that he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be analysed near the mass media and parliamentarians.
During the weekly appearances, he asked for “a less theatre and more facts”.
He also stated that he could give up a number of participants and that he would send them to his colleagues.
The debate will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as a leader, after he called a ghost cabinet and after the talk he held at the TUC annual convention.
In the meantime, the leader of the Laburist Party's decision to maintain silence in the construction of national oil during a job held on Tuesday at the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative parliamentarians and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national flag drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that it "saved silence in a respectful manner" and recognized "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabin, Owen Smith, said for the two's Newsnight broadcast from BBC that it would be recommended to the Laburist leader to sing the national anthem "independant" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
In the 20-year term, ministers from the ghost cabin refused to participate in Mr Corbyn's front team, arguing by different opinions relating to the economy, defence and external, while less than one seat of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant states that the political differences in the Laburist Party are "sustained" after Mr Corbyn's appointment in his position towards the European Union and limited benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Laburist Party would bring about changes by eliminating the whole idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the level of "cap" from 26,000 lire to 23,000 lires.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth lab leader facing David Cameron at the court in the last decade since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Laburist leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says that he has the idea of "external sources" for questions to address Mr Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North stated that PMQs involves a very high level of confrontation and that it will be able to deal with complaints and attacks, requiring them to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will hold her place at PMQs when he can't participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying that he approached the President of the House of Representatives, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" associated with PMQs, but he later admitted that he failed in his duty a few years later.
From the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs was considered a key barometer for the rationalization of a leader, the way in which it leads the House of Members and its position among parliamentarians, despite the criticism that it has become a character and that it needs a profound reform.
‘Catru in Joburg’: Young people without a background benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived abroad in childhood found a way to learn a trade and earn their lives.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young people to make photographs of the areas in which I live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says the biggest wages could make the extension
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, said that a growth in minimum wage in the British Sea could mean "a greater purchasing power in consumer potential pockets."
However, it is unlikely that the purchasing power concerned would exceed the greater cost of labour force in the company, he said.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports's expansion plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be angry and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a colateral victim in the "furtuna" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves much praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the duo known as "Special Ks", was badly delayed in the light of the reflectors by the scandalous passage that Kyrgios had faced by Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a short-distance contest in Cincinnati, the stager had to intervene twice in order to disband Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have put him on the ground on Kyrgios, and I should have put him on the ground on this kid."
Although he was last seen making a prophylaxis after he had muscle cramps and ran a possible US Open tournament, angered by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is now in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for the two-in-one place, after Bernard Tomic at Cupe Davis's semifinal against England.
"One thing I feel powerful is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little late in the conflict," Healy said.
The truth is he broke a rocket when he lost it because he accused the US of cracks, but it's not the first player to break a rocket out of his face and know Thanasi enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, it's got very good in circumstances that's pretty provocative in the US with Harrison and so far and I think it deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a wonderful family together, and I think he's been treated wrong.
He is a 19-year-old very mature, worked hard and joined the team, had no kind of conflict with other players, is very respected in clothing, he is trained in hard work, is an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man, and he believes that he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and shortcomings.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios in the calculation for the important repair game, which begins tomorrow, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the original player from Canberra in the long term in the team.
"First of all, we want the team to concentrate fully on the relief game and not to think only of the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has hit very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he matures under public authority and made some terrible and worthy mistakes to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions and believe he needs a time when he is not in the centre of attention to be able to reflect, good for both team and for him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage towards Bernie Sanders has decreased to half in national polls
The former State Secretary, Hillary Clinton, continues to have a two-digit advantage in the democratic course for the national candidate, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins land.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the Democrats (58% drop), while Sanders is at two, with 27% (in the face of 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced if he will apply to the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the first elections, most Democrats say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
In front of the probe carried out by the CBS news last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton maintains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has decreased significantly and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among Democrats under 50 years of age has disappeared, being now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still benefiting from the elderly.
Last month, Clinton is in front of Sanders, with one percent of two figures, among the liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage in this group.
Nearly half of the Democrats at the national level declare that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they chose to apply in the name of the party.
One sphere would support it either reserved and another 15% would only support it because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It may be surprising, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be enthusiastic about their choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a sphere would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of Democrats claim to support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of Republican voters who declare the same thing about the first class is Donald Trump (35%) less.
When Clinton's supporters are addressed with an open question about why she would like to win the course, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), given that she has come to be a woman's president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility is also mentioned.
In view of the fact that the Vice-Presidents are taking a possible candidate to the presidency, 57% of the Democrats would like to see him in the course - although a third believe he should not.
In the question of the second option for the party's representative, Democrats call Biden the majority.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said that Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to apply for the Democrat party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows from 20 points with Biden at 30 points if he does not.
55% of Democrats consider Clinton's candidate with the greatest chances of winning the general elections, but the figures fell from 78% as they were last month.
Biden is located at a distance of two, but the percentage according to which it is the most eligible to grow.
However, when they are asked what is most important to a candidate, Democrats prefer the problems instead of eligibility.
As last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential course.
Democrat candidates or potential candidates are well informed about some key features of their party's primary voters.
Most of the members consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trust and have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen the best of all three about integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.
30% of the Democrats do not believe that H. Clinton is complete and trustworthy, twice more than those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not think about him in this sense.
Democrats also generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
With regard to all these aspects, almost a sphere among the Democrats has no view of Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal e-mail address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was Secretary of State, most Democrats are grateful for its explanation of the subject and say that it did not affect the general view of the candidate.
But things are different with the American public.
Half of the Americans are ungrateful now for their explanation, while only about a third are grateful.
The public opinion was shared in March on this subject, shortly after the issue was settled.
Most Americans claim that their e-mail dispute did not affect their general view of Clinton, although 36% said that they changed their opinion in a negative way.
In general, more than six of the 10 republics claim that they have changed their view of Clinton in a negative sense.
Although Democrats consider Clinton as an integrated and reliable one, this aspect continues to raise problems among members at the general level: only 32% is an integrated and credible view, with 8% less than last month and with 15% less than in any other.
62% of the voters do not consider it comprehensive and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider Trump as an integral and trustworthy believer.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six evaluated candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are the first to be classified as integrity candidates.
The number of those who consider the entire Sanders is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, as in Carson's case, many have no opinion about him.
The error margin for the 351 sample of primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the boy's weight were accused of killing the student in 1 year at the Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an opening ritual in the Poccoon Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brothers of the Baruch College in New York attacked Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013 and tried to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his decision, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to his eyes, placed behind him a 14 kg bag full of sand and was repeatedly burned while trying to get to a tight, frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused the head pain after losing his knowledge.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi brother did not call the emergency number after she left and claimed she would have been waiting an hour before she went to the hospital, says the police.
But they found the time needed to change Deng's clothes, to look for its symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brotherhood at the national level, to ask for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner, at a press conference.
"At this point, members have begun to hide personal goods and have put the good news of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's well-being," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the second day of the morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated traumas to his head, knees and shoulders.
"Most families have been destroyed by the rituals of the brothers since 1970, at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer of Deng's family, in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The jury of the Monroe District has recommended that the first five members be charged with the third grade murder.
The other thirty and two members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be put under charge of further and complex murder.
"We want to draw on the response not only the persons involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the burden, official or informal, we will also draw on the response," Wagner said on Tuesday at a press conference.
Baruch's faculty has banned the fraternity and the national fraternity has withdrawn the file with the local representative.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve will increase the rate of wealth
The profit rate will increase and the bul (growth market) will increase, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will be reduced.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will be and how long it will last.
In the economy, history offers few indications of timing.
Following the first growth of the profit rate, the recession was only 11 months and 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to Increase Rates of Benefits is rather, although not always a decisive factor in how the economy and financial assets are responsible.
Therefore, U.S. Central Bank officials stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on the time when they start to increase their profit rate and on the time-construction needed for normalization.
Actually, there are multiple variables in the game.
However, in the end, market players could find that all the anxiety related to the growth of the profit rate has been exaggerated.
"The first growth of Fed's profit rate after the global financial crisis will be interpreted inevitable by some voices as a sign of the "Effet Banks", said Julian Jessop, chief economist at the Economics Capital, in a customer-oriented note.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to normal but still little to constitute the seismic shock that seems to all to be feared.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
In view of the situation in which the market has been faced in recent months, advance growth in the rate of wealth can slow things down for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for capital profitability to slow down over 12-24 months after first growth, which reflects the monetary policy deficit," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after Fed's growth.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has grown worse - with about 14 percent - moving to the growth rate of prosperity, quite invariable in the 250-day period (meaning of 2.6%) after returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the New Asset Management's chief strategy.
Deutsche said that the impact on actions tends to become more pronounced later in the growth cycle and benefits are beginning to decline.
Recycling is a reality of economic life, but growth in the rate of wealth contributes greatly to this.
In the face of the situation, Fed faces certain conditions that did not exist before and which could speed up a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed's profit rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 growth rates after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even if in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, at least the situation is expected to persist, the third quarter reaches only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in profit rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have prepared annually for an increase decision by Fed, all the eyes are open to this week's meeting of the Federal Commission of the Open Market, which ends in June.
Although many strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in profit rates during this meeting, transactions at the time indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our post-50 study, all growth cycles of the profit rate have so far been found in a supercreative cycle of profit, the PIB eclipsing the age before the recession very quickly after recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a remarkable recovery of late after the most severe recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by Fed from the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months long, and it reached 74 months and continued.
The fixed wind was also flying in view of the market predicting an increase in profit rate and the type is similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions when Fed changes politics.
In the case of obligations, the benefits seem to change the direction immediately resulting from the first growth/down of the cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle of the profit rate, the profitability of the obligations falls immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategy is of the opinion that these increases in profit rates will determine the closeness of profitability between short-term and long-term obligations, applying curves.
The high-performance obligations are better fulfilled in such an environment, although "we are still careful about strengthening profitability", said Kathy Jones, an analyst at the end of the Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to Fed's political expectations.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and the reduction of estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to a more stable monetary policy," Jones wrote.
The profit rates in the short term have increased, the profitability curve is more accurate, the spread of the credit average rate has increased and the volume has increased - all market characteristics when Fed defends politics.
In large lines, companies that engage in the majority activity in the USA will have won as a result of the growth of the profit rate and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debt will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to their production in the global market and their debt will be much more expensive.
"Historic history shows that "quality stocks" tend to be more beneficial in the next three months for an initial growth of the profit rate," said analyst Goldman Sachs in a report to customers.
Firms with strong budgets exceeded those with a weak balance after each of the gains rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Large capital acquisition companies and low-voltility stocks have also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most lost, says Goldman.
Consumers will also gain from the increase in the dollar.
Economicists could also have won, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, states parliamentarian Andrew Bingham
Conservative Parliamentary Andrew Bingham criticised the radio post because "he's spreading"
This says it's from what it's like the commercial opponent.
He also took to the eyes of BBC Music Awards, claiming that they paid Brits' prizes.
College Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that neither this issue is original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentarian, putting pressure on the post to prove that he does something that commercial positions don't do.
Conservative Parliamentary Andrew Bingham also transmitted to BBC heads that the public radio station "prosperous" and is increasingly similar to the commercial enemy.
"I had the impression that Radio 3 "protests" - although I don't like using the word - but I had the impression that it's turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took to the eyes of BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seems to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that do nothing but copy what already exists on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is very much in front of its commercial opponent on live music and public education.
I won't find anything about classical music coming from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important for Radio 3 to discover new music and the location of new pieces," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, stated that more efforts must be made to attract audiences from the previous period because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element found under the BBC signal criticised during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would follow its commercial rivals.
Conservative Parliamentary Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the retail show bought by BBC from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for the amount of approximately 22 million esterline lire.
Do you understand why there is so much discussion on the issue because it is not original and does not differ in anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show carried out by BBC1 - having Palma Faith and Boy George in jury - be carried out "in a specific way BBC."
He added that he wanted his own Corporation to "find a gold bowl in its own garden" next time he started a show of fun.
However, he refused to prohibit future use of new sessions in The Voice or spend money on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales registered the smallest growth in August and won could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Last month, the latest growth from 2000 to the present was registered.
Online sales took place three years ago, due to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that the Black Friday of November could determine the return on expenses.
For more than a decade, online purchases have exploited and transformed commercial stars from the British Sea into a fantastic city.
Experts say, however, there are signs that online sales decrease, the latest figures indicate an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
All the money spent in August has shown the smallest growth from 2000 to now, with only 5% increase in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales decrease, the latest figures indicate an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the level of growth from previous years and return to 2000, there has always been a rationalised trend in time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index for Guardian.
He explained that online sales had progressed in the last three years, when buyers began using the mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do it in different circumstances, as it would have been on the couch.
But now that it's slowing down, you could notice a decline (growth).
The name Black Friday, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of the experts, buyers would be able to make purchases before the event takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers burned in front of the computers to put their hands on the offer, which led to the spread of more retail sites.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when the buyers fought on the chilippers, could determine the resistance of the buyers.
A published study by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1 £ of each 5 £ is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are currently carried out through online stores.
At the same time, more than one sphere of people prefers to buy clothes and shoes online than to appeal to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the Sanctuary of the Bin Laden family, Muslims collect the victims killed after the Macarali massacre in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were on the streets of Muslims, the first funerals in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia won the giant part in the construction of Saudi Binladin Group for printing.
The Ministry of Health stated that total 394 people were injured following the macara outbreak
In the street crossing ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macara bound to the Mousche Sea in Mecca.
The people who complained about their deaths joined in the road to express their condolences until the first death arrived at the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moaisse cemetery.
The monument is preserved from the holy place, where just a few days ago a building macaroni was dug through the mosque's ceiling, walking on the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the Saudi King Sanctions Sanctuary Sanctuary of the Bin Laden Family Construction Group for Disaster, which was also armed with 394 injuries.
In the ceremony detoured on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macara bound to the Mousche Sea in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, the Great Manchester, found in his first battle when the macara was stopped.
Mr. Akram is in the Moschee Sea with his parents before the start of the war year.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the gay war in Mecca will continue, thousands of people arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that Binladin Group shouldn't have left the arm of the tall macara when the macara wasn't working.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group is partially guilty of fraud.
The information agency’s English service did not provide the relevant details, but stated that the company’s leaders had received a ban on leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macaroni in Marii Moschei's court, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the gay fighting that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the abuse of the macaral and the Group's representatives have not been able to contact the statements.
The Regal Decree defeated the group because it did not use updated security measures and did not coordinate its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Ten of the macarals engulf the Mosche Sea of Mexico, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For a few decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and goes through major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegated" son, who lost his family in the '90s.
The bombing has occurred under strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the government to participate in the fighting, essential trips at least once in the life of every Muslim natural apt.
The authorities claim that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities have decided that the victims' brothers decided to receive a million Saudi Riali (174,000 lire sterline) and that the same amount is paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other damages will receive half of this amount.
The benefits and disadvantages of the conversion of loans into eleven francs
On the bank market, there have already been two offers of conversion into loans in French, the main advantages being the exclusion of the currency risk and the reduction of the rates.
Disadvantages can come over a few years, when double variable may lead to higher rates.
The Transylvania Bank just concluded the process of credit conversion in France granted by Volksbank, and Bankpost announced a conversion offer for its customers.
According to the accumulated data from financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bankpost offers three years' fixed double on her, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank's conversion offer was accepted by 83% of French credit customers due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the value of the customer risk and management commissions, and an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the settlement in law.
Both offer reduces the rates of the client's own, the girl who paid the same month in hers before the conversion.
Thus, Bank Transylvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bankpost by 33% in the first three years and theoretically by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of credit coverage in the CHF is to eliminate the value risk, to protect the consumer from future growth of the franc, and to recover the credit will be made in the currency in which the wage is increased.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the reassessment of the property is no longer required, no further guarantees and another proof of income.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and there will be no additional costs such as in the case of a lender.
In addition, both banks offer a reduction at the monthly rate, the client's daughter paid before the conversion, equivalent to her.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first year is more than double, and the customer is very small from the main.
The Bankpost offer with very small dodging in the first three years seems to be beneficial to the customers.
You don't know how this thing will evolve after three years.
The customer margin may be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and cost reduction is smaller.
A possible risk for all credit in you with a double variable, is that the ROBOR index will create significant in the following years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR in three months is now 144%, and in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in some days it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to find other costs, not mentioned in the original offer.
The United States Federal Reserve has reached its date of decision on the rate of profits
The world focuses its attention on the scheduled meeting over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether to grow or not for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, less than half who thought last week that the decision would be taken, I believe now that the situation will be longer and that profits rates will be maintained in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation in which a major central bank could drop down at the zero rate and start a process of normalising the profit rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, the return of three million dollars in balance and generated a low inflation level.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the global situation less seriously.
He warned the markets to prepare for an increase, but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See who lost the drug.
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), passed through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia again in 2009 and lost his partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
It is also known that the actor would have faced the problem of drug consumption and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly has a cost.
Player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the bar for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at the right foot in the game played by Manchester United in the League of Champions, ended with a break in front of the endhoven PSV.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and which will hold him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The incident occurred after an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes after Shaw broke off the PSV defense at the age of 20.
He received medical care for nine minutes on earth and needed oxygen before he went to the hospital.
Van Gaal stated: "A double fracture at the foot and is in the hospital."
It's gonna be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow then it'll be operated in Manchester.
It's scary - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, faced difficulties, then playing fantastic, and now something like that happens.
She put her oxygen mask in her dress.
It's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but the double fracture is six months and will not play in groups.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seems to have been lucky and escaped from the red cardonous and the confession of a pedepsis hit.
Arbitrary Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexicans.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge alone when I say it's a red and red cardonish.
It was a very rough intervention, with two legs.
A message on Shaw’s Twitter account: “Thanks everyone for the messages, I don’t speak to express how weak I feel, I start to recover, I’ll be stronger. ”
Similar stories: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's accident in the PSV explosion
The English team's foundation has an additional reason to recover to play the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said: "This is a very bad accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players are never following an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very difficult because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when he heard that it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I haven't seen the stage.
I couldn't see except the lingge, which turned to another direction, so it seemed that [Morene] touched it, but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the SBS6 declaration, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to get through something like this.
I feel so stupid, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth's clearly risking England's commission, but it's still high.
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the selected team from England for tournament, I do not take into account a repetition of the 3-0 strike in the test games.
I wouldn't remove any variants of a victory in the move.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the team in the battle line and collective morality is strong; they will not be marked by 2012 events and will have a positive young attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it's unknown at test level, it's an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left the English team for the test games and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his chief coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but difficult reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no signs of questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this earlier - players are their own voters.
I want fifteen years and maybe Lyth would have extended the round, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he does more for Yorkshire, he'll have another chance.
The main trainer of the English team, Trevor Bayliss, gave him his attitude even when performance wasn't measured by his abilities and didn't surprise me; first of all, he's a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test games.
Lyth had seven rounds--as did Sam Robson before-- while Nick Compton had new.
Just Compton had luck at home and moving.
The only lack you could have had was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in the best shape - but the chance that it took is from the area of the past.
In the team comes Alex Halles, a batsman who's very good at it.
It's a cricket player who has "the X factor" and I noticed it earlier at Yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against ours at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be agreed at least on the same opportunity as those before it, but this will certainly depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen opens up at the battle with Cook, which would bring extra spinner saving at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a shooter couldn't hunt there and this left player has already proved he's given the shit.
Maybe Moen didn't bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was no. 3 for this, so the difference is not big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test games as the first drop before entering open in 2001.
He's been gone for three centuries, and he hasn't seen it yet.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the back-up spinner post and, although I had a limited contact with him, he hit me because he's a very impressive young man.
People could judge his age - with an average of 31 in battle and 35 in mines - and might think it's a point, but there's no herd of spinners and the selections have chosen for teenagers.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has brought some changes to the training team.
The number of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a test match consultant could be a master match.
It is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that it played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both the energy and the incredible ambition.
I always thought she was born to be involved in the international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, she has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the dress, even if they send messages that have been sent before, can bring air to the team.
Colly Durham's coach, Ben Stokes rest for the games one day, Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this.
Although not all agree, trainers and selection do not do the program.
And you have to keep, the players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions will never be easy.
The Brexit tab could have been won if the economy remained calm until 2017
The day before, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep the British Sea in the EU is increasingly in progress, even without the choice of General Jeremy "Yes or not?" Corbyn to lead the Laburist Party or TEC brings serious criticism to Europe.
The parties also have their characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in the past that - rooted in EU-like crises - not all being domesticized - some Member States are fed with the British agenda of concessions and amendments to treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, with the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that neither of them would want this if social protection had been violated.
We could even call it Dave and George's "self" agenda.
First, the Minister and Chancellor participate in the summits or bilateral sessions of foreign capitals, take a position in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain abroad under the EU's cover - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German Chancellor, is an ally who has been driving for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation gets worse, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too much.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be real or replaced.
And his power is in Declin.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is hard to believe that these will help the English that are present, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the British Sea - something they don't want because the majority have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers could even plan to make an intentional comment that does not, in the SNP style, help in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation has been fixed" and "The Great Britain has not received any renegotiation values."
Europeans know about their skin as well as how much they can be Fleet Street and how many scissors are the barons of the Bulgarian press that look at the EU with scepticism, because they have not participated in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn that ratified our entry from 1973 to Report 2:1.
Maybe I remember Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunity, who became famous at the beginning of the 1990s when he was a member of Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of tax non-paying pungais, foreigners who lied on the phone and non-home pseudo who have most of the important journals.
In fact, Tony Blair saw him about the same way, and he realized that when you're locked in a box with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blarite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, accompanied by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for it either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who got me friends last month in Westminster - I told him not to spend time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Murdoch's 80th-year-old labeling strategy by Neil Kinnock, a mistake then and now.
It may take a long time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left her Sunday holiday.
Corbyn's official position in front of Europe is what I would call the evolution of indulgently.
This states that he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who do not agree with the "english" of the conservators could agree with that.
This said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when his researcher fought not to admit that John McDonnell's appointment by Corbyn as Minister "in the winter" on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the '70s when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to the labyrinths, without going too far and without losing his job in the office.
Hillary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said and not to what the JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians during the private meeting last night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to transmit - you keep it, it made me aware of me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the age of social networks, a fire of parallelism and betrayal.
It is right that Cameron does not agree with a welcome ticket in Europe, allowing him to take good care of the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
However, McDonnell's and Corbyin's core summit on EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric debate among the left-wing citizens because the narcissism of small differences is a central doctrine.
As in his sophim about NATO - Tom Watson is silent about the fact that the JC will not campaign to give up - foreign diplomas will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose its political capital - and there are suspects - for the concessions to the British Sea when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that pays costs, as I recall at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum, months.
Critical Specialists Decision of the Department of Public Health in England on Electronic Lands
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of them related to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's publication in criticising the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic lands.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as "a complex analysis of the evidence."
Some researchers have, however, questioned the robustness of the data and have shown the right to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet's medical journal attacked the "extraordinary Fragil Base" on which PHE founded the main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in BMJ put their statements under question and their foundation “in a solid land or in a migrating land”.
Martin McKeee, professor of European Public Health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that it is expected that the PHE statements, in accordance with which "current estimates show that electronic tires are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting with 12 people led to the development of a multi-term decision-analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were recently presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell or said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received in the past funding from British American Tobacco for the withdrawal of an independent study.
This also validated the BAT's public health accreditation in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic ticket producer, but not the financing of which there are reports that it would have been received from the tobacco and tobacco producer Philip Morris International.
The arguments were not provided on the basis of which the panel members were selected, but this includes a number of 'frontiers' known in the production of electronic goods, some of which are even declared to be the financing of the industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for expertise in the tone control.
The meeting was also attended by the Chief of the Control Section of the PHE.
The group's research "mousamalises convincingly" that they lack "solid evidence of the harmful effect most products have on the majority of the criteria", McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell stated that the PHE statements that "there is no evidence that electronic media is a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of the Health Department of the PHE, said he has responded in the past to BMJ's statements.
He stated: "Electronics are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of the two people who smoked all their lives lost their lives because of this victim.
All the evidence suggests that the risks posed by electronic health threats are less comparable, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that is emerging and that does not arise from evidence, given in particular the high level of public confusion with regard to the relative risks compared to the tunnel.
Each year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking disease and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Explanatoryly expressing the current evidence - and of course, although the use of electronic devices is not at risk, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfill our national duty.

Claims on the Russian arms trade with the British Mari
Follow the film made by Amnesty International against the arms race.
Drone kills horrible!

And electric balsams that cause cold pain without leaving behind!
The happy voice and the animated images do not doubt that this advertising for the world’s largest later arms race is an adjoining charm, made by Amnesty International to underline the desire of the British authorities to sell the weapons of repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International at ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posts in bus stations and metros that need a second view.
"An important announcement, travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the ads, using the sources and branding of the London metro, the DLR line transforms into a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will be placed on DLR Customers are asked to contribute to the end of the arms race.
The 300 posts are made by artists who have exposed the works at the Cruel Design Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-lit Allen key package that says "encourages access to about a third of the world's bus stations."
The Kingdom of Transport in London is not impressed by this "vandalism" in the form of a flight.
One of the parish ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and conference at the University of Essex, artists ask more questions and seek to make the public's political works available outside the gallery.
Many artists turn to co-operation with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out in the real world so that their art will have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that happens to sailors traveling by the subway.
The film made by Amnesty had more than 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked for bonus, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free.
VCCP's creation director, Matt Lever, was looking for the silence around the advertising for the arms race - with an empty space in the exCel calendar - and he thought, "Let's offer them the campaign that he's trying to avoid."
They played with a more realistic announcement, but "inspired with strong animations and colors, it was more shocking".
"I have done a great job helping us to increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment in the background," says Tom Davies, named Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the authorities of the British Sea to take measures and ensure that torture equipment is not lawfully marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms race comes from the inside of the ExCeL, where exhibits offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab announced an order received from the US army concerning "AT4CS RS with a shoulder-strength launcher."
This includes “a unique form of focus that gives the first effect in the back of the arms, within the inside.
Whatever that means, it won't be fun.
Eight gold rules to live in the chamber
It's been 11 years since I moved into the chamber, when I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in virtue and moral relativity, but now I remember the strong tears of those who were upset - and the number of complaints to others.
Most of the things we have learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.

Violinist David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the greatest artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the founder of a less common project, of his right to "circumcised", as he even says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a leader, and this makes it the least curious in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissunances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a representation, Sunday, in which soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when in the first place the violinist Xavier Phillips was found, the works made by Enescu were non-lipsited.
Both shows, painted on the Athens scene, showed the audience another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissunances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being the only classical music collection in which there is no director.
The address is the most important music for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need education either to become soloists or to become an orchestra - talking about instrumentists, not composers.
They're trained as "specialized workers".
They insist that they need a director.
On the other hand, for the public, all the fetishing music tends to lead.
And so, business, the music industry, here's making marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have some qualified workers, what's stupid, and a public who can't listen, but have to look, what's stupid," he thinks, David Grimal.
The violinist tells us that this change in the way music has come after "the music detectives" from his soloist career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and bring money and the music industry.
After 10 years, when I was around 30 years old, I found this very depressive thing, because I no longer found the creativity and fraternity of the human system.
So, I haven't found any reason to continue on this road.
So I decided to believe the Dissociations.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did anything like this without a director: "The music world, extremely conservative, didn't want such projects."
"How do you imagine to make marketing with a collection of musicians in which there is no more ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledged that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the music that is part of the orchestra does not depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10-year existence of the assembly, the absence of a director did not prove to be a stumbling block in the musical act: "Surprisingly, as we sang a more complex repertoire, with so much simpler, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role," Grimal says, adding that the Sunday show "we were 74 directors on the scene".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave" just because it invited Les Dissonances and Les Dissonances: "A wonderful festival, where are the greatest orchestras in the world that sing and sing 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you have invited and this strange group."
In a temple of Orchestra tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there exists the place and interest for something different, which scatters barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist acknowledged that he felt Roman music of the Roman composer's brain, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works to the repertoire or.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, so this happens when we speak of George Enescu and Romance music, "for there is a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal military for changing the way classical music education is done, considering that "mouse of music, as it is organised today, has a taste of death" and that "the future of music represents intense music".
We don't have to make the 5-year-old world tour if it's nothing.
There were no global tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, they're all awesome, extraordinary, so long as they're in the music service.
If we're not, we're in a system in which creativity is suffering, it's no longer free.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal set an example for Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good links and meat".
In order to enter the EU, health laws which are not good for vegetables and meat were to be adopted.
Production and agriculture comes to the service of supermarkets, as is done in France.
The same thing happens with music, it's the same logic.
The Dissonances make roses may not be too beautiful, but when the taims are the real roses.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If I think - as I do Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, I reintroduce her in the school, I re-enter concerts on television and through this education we wouldn't need to sell music underproducts," says Grimal.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that are very communists, that's all, it's very military.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, musicians.
We speak of a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in some way, if we want to form a musician, it's with everything else.
According to your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist zambid.
The grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes just from overstepping this "soldier" status, the defeat of what "they think are their limits": "Musicns discover at some point that they're not soldiers, and that's why after the concert they come out of zombies."
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and his vision of music and about the artist in the "Idea festival", a discussion with the audience organized at the International Festival George Enescu by the Aspen Romania Institute.

Movie City looking for "Mimiles Voci Mari"
The movie City launchs the biggest challenge for children: double the two characters of the "Craíasa Zjapezi 3D" production.
You have a super-talent and spontaneous kid who likes the movies?
Give her the chance to get to see.
In September, as part of the new campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, it is hard to reach the future ages and who are between 8 and 16 years old, cinema City is looking for "Mimiles Voci Mari", offering them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters in a famous animation film.
If in classical drawings the emphasis is on approaching the voice of the actor of the specific character of the animated character in the last period, the creation of the story is taken into account and those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania wants to discover new voices and that's why we're leaving an Indian campaign.
We want to find the right voice and encourage parents to enroll their children in our competition.
They'll be part of a special experience, because the characters are nice and the relics are fun.
"The kids will play and have a real chance to become part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.

All that parents need to do is access a smallvociemari platform.cinema-city.ro, where to sign up the child at the competition and prepare him for voice test.
Finally, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will register by interpreting his own double version.
Four films about friendship, bass, magic and hope can choose competitions for support: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: the Garden of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala who knows 3D" and "Maya 3D Albinity".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream full and double as one of the top production "The Snow Queen - Críasa Zjapezi 3D", which will have the prize in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx cash flows are mixed, tax forecasts for 2016
FedEx has declared disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant, reducing the profit estimates for the year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its territorial transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by approximately 2.5% in the pre-market transaction, 45 minutes before the opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it is expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends in the month of next year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts predicated $10.84, according to a FactSet probe.
The estimated decrease is despite an increase in prices of 4.9% in the average, with entry into force on 4 January and larger ceilings for the transport of large packages or with large weights, which will apply from November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase profits over the previous year as a result of cost reduction, larger revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director-General Fred Smith stated that "the company is facing a much weaker economic situation than it is expected, especially with regard to global production and trade."
The commitment plans for the holiday period were announced one day after the UPS competitor stated that it intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of commitments that it made last year.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than last year.
The action fees were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 for action by 12 analysts who responded to Zacks Investment Research's survey.
The profit grew by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in Zacks' poll estimate the amount of $112.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of the revenue recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping sold the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In recent years, the income of the core dividend has increased by 29%, but operational income has been practical because of the higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in income due to higher base rates, while the income recorded by the free dividend decreased due to the costs of growth.
In the pre-market transaction, approximately an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $15.15.
March to close down by 11% at the annual level and 17% at the maximum record recorded on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most expected meetings in recent years, the responsible for developing policies within the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a month of the Honduran mahon with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to create a key rate of wealth for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the seating room of the central bank, a wall painting of the United States will be crushed.
The map is intended to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all.
The Central Bank has received a double commission from Congress: to maximize employment rate in the US and to maintain price stability.
But since the major economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third charge could be the X factor in a decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced in March, and which will determine if the US economy is prepared to be decomposed by the unprecedented incentive offered by the profit rate in the short term almost zero in force since the end of 2008.
Even if the majority of data indicate a strong economy, recent financial growth on the global financial markets could already encourage Fed officials to be careful about increasing volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only one percentage point.
"Of course, the labour and inflation market will be the first and main aspects to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the company's company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if this was to seek an excuse not to increase the rate of wealth, the uncertainty of growth on the global market is sufficient to give them arguments to wait," he said.
There is no consensus on the decision that Fed will take, which in itself leads to instability on the financial market.
About half of the recently questioned economists in Bloomberg predicted an increase in the profit rate this week.
But the financial markets are expected to both, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall on the bridge if Fed grows the rate of wealth, except for those who develop policies that would lose the fight by promising that it would last long to the next growth.
Tuesday, the industrial media Dow Jones drew 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16.599.85.
The progress has been expressed with expectations that Fed's decision factors will maintain the stable profit rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising that Fed would grow the rate of prosperity right now," said Lonski.
If Fed's decision-making factors were to do this, "he should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts said that an increase in the profit rate would calm financial markets because it would broaden the uncertainty associated with the moment Fed will act.
With just one month ago, Fed seemed to be on the way to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow recovery of monetary conditions that would confirm the US recovery force.
Yellen announced in the spring and at the beginning that it is expected to increase this year's profit rate in spite of the high liberal objectives as it would require further economic progress.
Although job creation ceased in August, growth in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate dropped by 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and almost the level considered by Fed as total employment of the workforce.
Payrolls have shown signs of growth.
And although inflation has continued to not reach the annual target of the central bank, Fed’s decision-making factors stated that a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices found in raw waste.
The economy "may be facing higher rates and needs them, since labour market pressure," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter the fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued the currency.
The industrial average Dow Jones dropped by 16% below the maximum record reached in more, as investors feared that the Chinese economy would slow down worldwide growth.
The market has recovered once this month, the Dow index is now approximately 10% below the maximum.
For Fed’s decision factors, market Aggression is added to the complex calculation of the time of growth of the profit rate.
"Without what happened on the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more firm in the seat," said Stephen D. Oliner, an expert researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was official Fed.
Now, he predicts they'll wait for at least a month to manage the best effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and almost no data to be based on subsequent events in China," Oliner said.
The improvement of the global economy is not one of the greatest interests of Fed, so it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
But, in fact, Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been high.
The President's simple argument since then, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed and the monetary expansion could be "inspired" by the global market collapse.
In a world where markets and economies are all the more complicated, it is expected that Fed officials not only monitor the progress recorded in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
His decision-making process is "more than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department in the management company Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., stated this month that "Fed has a history of oversized reactions to changes in the financial market which seemed to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Commission on the open market, a decision-making body, which supported the growth of the rate of wealth, provided for example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia has determined Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% at three meetings, "in spite of the implications of limited identification for US development", Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials came back on their losses.
Fed should put financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, as was the market price in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, was a member of the Bank of England's banking firm.
The last period of action shall not be higher nor higher than that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to get in the situation of fearing an increase in the profit rate due to the fact that the markets have been upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to hold the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this sense, I do not think it should take immediate action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts of the Nine Canal to transmit to Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent transfer of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to transmit the consequences of the changes in the leadership of the liberal party has not led to a significant increase in the hearing for Today.
The morning show of canal Nine sent out of the capital after Tony Abbott's fire in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competition issue Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was held in London as part of a series of broadcasts issued over the course of several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cascade Niagara and Cancun.
This "crossing" of the distance did not seem to contain too much for the Aussie TV telescopes, Sunrise having an audience of 397.000 telescopes in the five capital cities, facing today with 339.000.
Today it has recorded a slight increase compared to the monthly audits (317.000) and last March (283.000), but the figures were smaller than the previous Joys (343.000).
Today she mixed up the difference in Sunrise's face in recent months.
In August, today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Since September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349.000 Telespectors and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, not only Parliament is affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The new drama, having been subject to a newly discovered father, who decides to move along with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1.219 million Telespectors.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone, without Raffers' star, Rebecca Gibney.
The results of the hearings last night were rescinding that "yes".
The show X Factor transmitted by Seven was kept in position, with 1.136 million viewers, taking easy front of The Block shows (838.000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded the shootings and shells on the second night he sent The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate overall culture show had an average of 446.000 TV viewers.
The second half of the hour (17:30 to 18:00) hit 623.000 Telespectors - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (63,000).
Last night, the first half hour of the show The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520.000 TV viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720.000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
Losing the hearing recorded by Chase Australia on the second night will offer confidence to the Nine's closet that Hot Seat will triumph in the last at 17:30.

4 people and lost their lives after the police took their bullets in protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police took refuge in the majority that demonstrated against the new constitution proposed by the country, declared the welfare of an official.
Violence took place last night in the Rupandeh district, approximately 280 km west of the capital of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal's statements, the head of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police section, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that police forces used lacrimogen gas after they fired fires in the air before resorting to the use of rubber glazing.
According to him, twelve police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber gloves, which is known to kill, are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
Ciocination was the last event after weeks of violent protests conducted in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi said that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would give them political influence.
Protests also existed in Nepal, where ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent shells declared on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement to share the country in the province - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a country governed at central level for hundreds of years.
The process of developing a new constitution was canceled in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kahmandu, the legislators voted in favour of the draft constitution and the officials said that the new letter could be adopted Sunday.

Diabetes reduction surgery may be useful in case of mild obese
The benefits of surgery to reduce the weight in patients with mild obstetric impairment, with type 2 diabetes, could last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say if diabetes is mildly obese to live longer after the surgical intervention of loss in weight than those following non-surgery treatment.
"It takes a lot of time to centralise mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obstetrician, as she wrote an article about a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, named and bariatric surgery, use different methods to minimise stomach.
These reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with mild obesity, with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or higher.
IMC, a weighting unit in relation to height, is considered normal at intervals 18.5-24.9.
The IMC value of at least 25 indicates that one person is superior and persons with IMC over 30 are considered obedient.
You can calculate the IMC by accessing: 1.use.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used the data in a trial after 2007 comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and mansion gastrointestinal gastrotomy - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The average IMC in people who suffered surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
In the meantime, IMC in people who received non-surgery treatment against diabetes Zaharat remained close to the same level, and that is 29.
Among those who suffered surgical intervention, the diabetes had been completely sold at 36% and partly at 28%.
In the drug-treated group, by comparison, diabetes has been completely sold to only 1% and partly to only 2% of subjects.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “was generally better in the surgical group”, the authors concluded.
Researchers have also monitored the blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of glucose in time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
Following surgical intervention, the mean haemoglobin level A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the drug-treated group, approximately 8% remained.
But this improved "glycemic control" - reflected in the improved levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce the mortality rate by five years, according to researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with the manoeuvrectomy, the biopsy surgical intervention group lost more weight (18.7 face 14.2 kg), recorded a more significant decrease in IMC (7.4 face 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% face 2.1%) and showed a higher probability of complete diabetes reduction (46.9% face 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on people with major difficulties in Sweden that surgical intervention prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, University of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obedient individuals who have suffered bariatric surgery presented a risk of approximately 29% lower deaths after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival for patients who suffered surgical intervention, Blackstone stated that it is an optimal aspect for IMC personnel under 35 procedural interests.
"This is the point in which this work is critical, since it claims that this surgical intervention is safe in the lower IMC group," she says without increasing the risk of depletion or renal disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their medicines should begin - take the weight seriously when the IMC of the patient reaches 27-30.
"I think we expect too much until we persuade people to take this issue seriously," she said.
I think that once these genetic changes have been accumulated, which have cut their bodies, predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to go back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all the refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to end the violence in the country of refugees' mother countries.
Dalai Lama spoke of the current problem of the refugee crisis in the speech he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for the Cooperation of Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the British Sea.
He said that, in the present situation, the interests of humanity should be superior to the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
It also stressed that, although impressive, the European response to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama encouraged Germany and Austria's efforts to face the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but we must think at the same time about long-term solutions to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education in Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attacks of 11 September, claiming that the violent response from the US has generated a launch of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolences in a letter addressed to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his reasons were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who ingested from their hands in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Fraud Centre, US Anti-Fraud Centres reported an increase of approximately 400% from 2010 with regard to the number of children under 12 years of age who have abused their hands with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gayrad Lopez, director of the Georgian Anti-Fraud Centre, cases of inference of the hand-loss in children under 12 years of age reported at anti-Fraud Centres were reported from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"The kids have access to these products more frequently and, unfortunately, one percent of them reaches the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children were deliberately drunk and others did it to impress their friends or to respond to social networks.
YouTube can be followed by films that present to adolescents such as a detergent drink to create cheap drinks.
Teenagers seem to have mixed the fatty water detector with alcohol to get a bigger drink.
Smaller children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think he's hurting him," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (by hand dealer) are the perfumes.
Detergents of hands with aroma of caps, strokes, Portuguese are the most attractive for children.
The handle holder contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially for young children, only a few hugs can cause alcohol abuse.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Anti-Fraud Center in Kansas University Hospital, for Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a whiskey beer on the table, but people leave these hand-loss in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently entered school, the equivalent of four hand-lossed drunks, came to the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a medical doctor in the emergency room who treated him at the Medical Gwennett Center outside Atlanta.
I didn't know the ball and he couldn't walk when he came to the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her over the night in a separate hospital to identify signs of brain injury, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was exciting," said Ortoria Scott, Nihaijah's mother to CNN.
He could have been his girlfriend.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use products or soft drinks without alcohol and no longer leave the child’s guardian hand in the womb.
In addition to alcohol abuse, some detergents were associated with poisons.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after they had a detachment of hands containing a toxic ingredient, undeclared.
Health authorities have assumed that the product contains methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the four classes in the north of New York committed themselves to defeat the "bad" teacher "setting antibacterial products in the class", according to a police report.
The professor is very allergic to the dealer's hands and stopped him in his classroom.
The police considered that the plan was "unexpected" and addressed the disciplinary problem of the school inspector.
Rumour Mill: There are no differences in Celtic
Griffiths demonstrates the rumors of Celtic ignorance, Deila acknowledging that Hoops are not at the best time, but they will come back.
Hearts faced with the SFA regarding Neilson and Warburton's charges are prepared for the purchases of January that affected the team's unity
Dons grow the difference from Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penance in the first rehearsal brought those from Aberdeen to a narrow victory in front of those from Hamilton to Pittudrie, making a difference of five points between them and Celtic.
Griffiths demonstrate the bells associated with misunderstandings
They appeared inconsistencies in Celtic, driven by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subject to a growing pressure in order to be prepared to face the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are waiting.
The absence of discounts in the course for the title makes it difficult on the Netherlands - from Boer
The middle-class fan of Rangers and the former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer declared that Dutch football supporters lost their interest in Celtic - because they didn't fight for the title with Rangers.
From Boer, now Ambassador of the Ajax, declared: “In the Netherlands the summaries of the Celtic games are no longer transmitted; why?
Because they're not the Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the return of the Rangers.
It's about Old Firm.
It's about both laoling teams and that's where the interest is directed.
The tension is great in the old firm matches and not only the discounts want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, I promise Deila.
RONNY Deila agreed that Celtic is fighting in response, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The curse with Malmo and the subsequent removal of the Campionary League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now found in the top of the class with a five-point advance.
But Deila said: “Celtics had a period of time before they would come back. ”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to go further.
We desperately need the support of Celtics because that's how players get better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton’s wisdom regarding January’s transfers
In spite of the comments last few weeks that suggested it would have identified some targets for transfers from January, the Chief of Rangers, Mark Warburton is prepared when the transfer comes, insisting that he does not want to affect the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former head of Brentford stated: “The period of transfers from January is very different from that of the evening."
In the case of the players you moved away, there is a period before the season in which you can be integrated, which you could observe in this season in our group.
The team's working very well.
Sometimes it's worse if you bring players that aren't needed.
Celtic visits Michu after withdrawal
Striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested he could withdraw from the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player has been fighting English problems for two years and has failed to leave the country of Galilee in the evening.
Hearts facing SFA regarding Nelson's comments
Hearts led with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red cardboard of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red cardboard cancelled in eight months.
Nelson notes his statements, saying: “I didn’t doubt integrity, I didn’t comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
Invincible Hibee was taken to the root after acknowledging that he sang a song with offensive verses about the former player from Hearts, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a village in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a village with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was Derby and was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the striker, adding: "I don't have to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadic Council trusts Dundee United - Donnelly Management
Simon Donnelly insists that those in the Dundee United Council still believe that the management team will change the situation - but it is agreed that the decline on the ground should close.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys back in shape," said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy for "murder victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team has to meet with hope of Hamilton Acices to get the seven successive victories in the league, which brought them five points towards Celtic due to the defeat of the first arrest by Adam Rooney.
McInnes stated: "There is no team to win something in a cup or a leg, and not win such games."
The rate of unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as the British Sea grows
RATAS in Scotland remained unchanged, being 164,000 in May, while the number of British mines increased by 10,000 in total, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than in the British Sea, 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the National Statistical Office (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12000 over a three-month period, the number of workers currently employed was 2,612,000.

State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the recent figures, said: “The long-term plan of the authorities has laid the foundations of a stronger economy.”
It's almost a year since Scotland took the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have noted improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the rate of employment of the workforce recording growth and the rate of unemployment.
Why I'm a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for late legal intervention, I'll see how a man is sentenced to death.
If this happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be in a shelter for observers from the Oklahoma State Prisoner's execution room and I'll see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the letal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and, although I was searched, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I'm worried about it.
So, why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the capital court.
He'd offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists can be witnesses to the U.S. executions and, because often the applications exceed the number of places available, there is a poor lotteries to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for the representatives from the press from 12 to five.
Those who choose will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do this.
I'd be next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also developed my own relationship with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a carnage and a pix to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants it, get access.
I cried to her.
He acknowledged that he could have done better, but he still thinks I'm wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I said and wrote them.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses all the time.
But he wants to be presenting an international report to write on the subject.
He believes that, if he dies, advertising will help move against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of media files we've done.
I won't come back here on all the details.
I can't say I'm sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify the sentence of death.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll look at him dying from this perspective.
I can't claim I'm a total target.
For this reason, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out how to look at a man I love dying in vain.
Peter Moody claims that the Stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to withdraw from the course
Peter Moody said that the Racing Victoria stewars or tried to infiltrate a spy on his graffiti last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the course.
He launched an attack against the Stairs and of the Department of Integrity of Racing Victoria, claiming that he was missing a personal campaign against him, the painting that filled his face with the removal of Lady Dadi from the course due to a treatment administered on the day of the course.
Moody stated for Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the field of courses and that he has been put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the test for the Cobalt of Lidari, because he has no explanation.
During 18 months, he closed the words on the spy statements and did not want to be like "the wolf that doesn't reach the strings".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that, and I've stayed a long time, but sometimes it's getting to a level of frustration as high as it's getting worse from one time," Moody said.
He knows he's gone.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's best.
From the moment they start believing that this doesn't happen, they have to give up the course of training.
I'll have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certificate.
Earlier, Moody threw a bomb into a given interview for racing.com in which he declared that the integrity department tried to spy on his graffiti.
"After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were in a shelter with a man - whose name I'll tell him if they're asked - and they offered to hire him to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously, he thinks I'm a triser.
If that is so, then he should give all his resignation because they were incapacitated in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO executive director of the RVL, knew at the time and I know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to begin to have a vertebral colony and can it lead to people outside the training for what is happening in industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on industry so bad?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and give it to one side and I'm not sure that the statements I'm making now could decide to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care, and that upsets me.
I'm really sorry.
I'll put pressure on them and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration grew once with a long research into the cobalt test involving Lidari and the removal of him was determined to say that he could "he put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the uninhibited Black Caviar campaign, marked the rule of treatment on the day of the course as being "rical" after applying on the legs a cataplasm with nym or argill, which hits the rules.
Break the rules of the courses.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees put him in the wrong mood on his feet.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what happened.
It happened on the day of the course.
Moody could be downgraded for three months for treatment on the day of the course consisting of the application of cataplasm, because the stewars opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We understand with all that it needs rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The victim who hit and fled from the accident in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man after a collision with a bicyclist produced in Cobram at the end of the week and after running away from the scene.
The bicyclist was transported by the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit on a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police representatives state that the driver of the vehicle has not stopped helping the injured bicycle.
Moony, a 50-year-old man, was handed over to the Shepparton police.
It seems that he will be accused of running away from the scene, neglecting the first aid and other road offences.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains inside, stable.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, answers opposers in the Wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms brought by his team's team's gambling tactic as "denatural subjects" brought to the discussion of the two main favorites of the NRL.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the Arbitrations allowed the players from Storm to "take them to the ground" team in the game won the nerves of Storm at the end of the competition played last night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after the victory of his team in the North Queensland Cowboys qualification game, played Saturday evening, when he called the game a "show" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland were not too proud of wrestling.
Bellamy dropped in defense of his team's payment tactic and said that players just concentrate on "contact" when they pay.
Bellamy says he fell into trust after two important trainers criticized the team, which means they were worried that Storm would win.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson crying out of wrestling when we were hit by the score 24-2," Bellamy laments.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything every year in our defense systems or techniques so much that in the last six weeks, I've actually put the emphasis on contact in favor and so I've changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and clearly has a wonderful team so it's probably not used to lose and it was a shock for him.
We know what's always going on in this year's period.
Bellamy contrasted Bennett's idea of "the soul of the football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010.
Wayne's talking about palpitating football.
And he argued his opinion by comparing the game of Saturday night with our game of Friday night and talked about how palpitant was the game," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George received a lot of criticism because he was a burden-bearing team and Wayne said he didn't even care about anything black under the corner.
But now he has a team that can play what I think to be a palpitating football, especially due to the middle of young boys.
This kind of game you want to do when you have players like that.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his game style -- not any team has two middlemen like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're somehow worried about the game with us.
Now six weeks probably didn't think about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also highlighted the fact that the game between Storm and Roosters was a closer relationship with the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, haven't we seen him yet, how was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, that's a palpating game?
Or the palpitant means you're taking a break and you're not going to go?
They're plans for me.
If they're talking about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys or Cronella Sharks, at the end of the next Saturday's preliminarys, at AAMI Park, the tickets are on sale starting in the next morning.
Stefan Hogg used the girl's phone to join the pedophiles to send images
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stefan Hogg took the girl's phone when he fell asleep and then got authenticated into an online e-mail service where another user sent him a series of wrong images having children subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the missing phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while she was sleeping.
He looked over the phone and found the disturbing messages after he warned Mom immediately.
After tomorrow, the police saw the five posts and then analyzed computers found at their address and found “anxious” search on the Internet using terms to find indistinguishable images with children's subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "draw the pedophile" on the Internet before "he claimed he was a cop to scare them."
Professor Elidh Robertson of Dundee’s Institute stated: “He said it’s an addiction - it’s up to people to fear.
He recognized that he did his computer search, but he said he did it because he wanted to get a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent the images to him and about the fact that he asked the person in question to send them more pictures.
He said he did it to join.
He said he didn't think clearly when he was drinking and he wanted to see images of violence and crimes.
Mr. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she broke the mother and the tears and tears.
The girl saw the indisputable images on the phone and the accused was challenged.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed more young than he did.
Last year, on 14 June, 23-year-old Hogg, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, committed guilt on charges that he had committed or had taken improper positions with children, and violated the conditions of release on 25 January of this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March of the current year.
The defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it could be said that this offence “did not involve a significant sexual aspect”.
Judge Alistair Carmichael extended his conscience until October, for reasons of social reporting.
Hogg was released on the search in this file but remained in custody before setting up for other files.
It was passed into the register of sexual offenders before the sentence was passed.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, sent the wrong speech to Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, the film of the fall has become violent on social networking.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by representatives of the opposition who claimed that an anonymous threat to death would have been received, threatening that Mr. Mugabe would not be able to escape during his speech.
Last month, they invited him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on the mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a secret number but it is entitled "death", he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns parliamentarians that immunity applies only to Parliament and once it leaves Parliament, immunity is no longer valuable.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangari, is "anxious" with regard to threats transmitted to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availability
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 available as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will be divided into two companies, separating the computer and printer division of corporate hardware operations and services found in fuel growth.
The estimated availability will bring costs of approximately $2.7 billion, starting with the quarter, said the company HP.
"These restructurings will bring new Hewlett Packard Enterprises a more competitive and sustainable structure with regard to costs," said Meg Whitman, President and Director-General HP, who will lead the unit after the collapse.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less focused and less focused than HP now and will have a wide portfolio of business that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business-off style," said Whitman.
Working as separate companies, we are better placed than ever in order to meet the requirements of increasing our customers worldwide.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual incomes of over $50 billion and "will focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals" addressed to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, which is the object of the activity of the production of electrical equipment and the garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley" plant.
HP has gone through massive reorganisation to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest companies in the US technology sector, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies focusing better on a direction have a better performance.
FriendsFest: the series of comedy that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, since the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the age of 15 years.
In 2013, the suicide represented the main cause of deaths in men aged 20-45 from the British Sea, and remained three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campagn Against Living Miserably (CALM) appointed 2015 as the Year of the Man, seeking to bring about a cultural question that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of the fight to the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted by more than 2000 high school students who presented symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is sufficiently overwhelmed by many friends "with a healthy disposition", his chances of recovery are doubled.
In the same way, for people who are not depressed, a search for healthy mental friends reduces half the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, in order to be effective, this must first be accessible.
In this context of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response is largely prior to meaningful contact.
Our digital windows have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to entertainment and success, even if in reality isolation is what dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call foreign values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of internal values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship - which also affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't even buy happiness.
The essence of the friendship series was that he focused on this idea.
Persons were not defined by their place of work and by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The death of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they look at the football in the comfortable photos and Ross' passion for Rachel, came from knowing that men can be associated with this situation, even if they are still forced to explore their feelings completely.
As one social worker explained to me, "my role in listening to people who tend to kill and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Now, people who call on us are not able to talk to their friends.
The old habit of developing yourself is powerful, just as the feeling of being understood as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to my mind when I try to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
The series highlighted the few moments of friendship between men.
While there is much help in the objective, external intervention, through the telephone, the combined people at times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So if you participate in this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of film platforms to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what the difference might make your friendship.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - with #FriendsFest
Di Maria walks and helps PSG give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matudii and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria marked March in his preliminary game in the Campionary League and helped PSG to stand before the Swedish Malmo team.
We continue to present you the history of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani and did the commission, Paris Saint-German starting the series of games from the Campion League groups, with a 2-0 racing victory against Malmo in the game played Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria marked in less than four minutes from the start of his campaign in the League of Championships in the PSG team, bringing France's campaigns in advance, though they missed a series of occasions before ensuring their advantage with the naked eye marked by Cavani in 61 minutes.
Getting to Group A with Real Madrid and Şahtior Donečk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish campaigns because the French team's objective is not only to qualify for the best but also to improve the path to the final areas in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the notes, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect table, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who broke the chance to go after he was replaced by the team from his hometown and the club where he started his career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or move to the Campus League, so victory with 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference with the following classes, even if there are more aspects to be achieved throughout the season," says Blanc.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and did it, but I'm sorry we couldn't give one or two more gorillas.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 remixed home from Bordeaux in Liga 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took the light from the reflectors in four minutes.
The last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the average Argentinan abuser was named the man who will lead PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he landed at Marco Verratti's passport behind Malmo's defense before he learned incrediblely about Johann Wiland, in the long collection of the right port.
But if someone expected PSG to get victory from his hands, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who won Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the land with new national teams, with a defense of five people and two middle-class defenders, was a powerful opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except making Nikola Djurdjic's uncle who passed Kevin Trapp's post in 34 minutes.
Instead, PSG players have slowed down the pace several times, giving some useless and non-finishing interventions, even Ibrahimovic who has carried out not less than five first rehearsal tests and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game replay.
Abrahamovic, however, proved much more careful in supporting his colleagues, his passport being the one that Di Maria sent him to a remote village in Wiland over the port in 52 minutes.
The second gorilla was registered in a final after an hour of the game, according to Cavani, the urgujan who signed the season's season hall after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centre.
This gol has eliminated the hope of Malmo's people that they will re-equilibrate the score and only a great stop of Wiland from the distance for David Luiz's rescinding kept the final score before the new Ezequiel Lavezzi entry cancels a round in the long run.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, further stated that PSG was with a class over and that "The last game I played in the Championships League was in December last year."
Since then, I've only played in Sweden, which doesn't rise at the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
More for PSG.
They made a great game.
Glencore EUR 2.5 billion for sale of shares
The Gigante Miner Elvetian Glencore, who lost the price of the stock exchanges, paid $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a broad debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted on the London bridge, said he sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds of sterline to close the debt.
Following the loss of 57% of its market value this year, the company takes to the market at prices in excess of the freight burden, because the decline in China's economic activity affects demand and threatens to destroy the market.
The preferential right to subscribe increased the price of Glencore's actions on the London bridge in the early summer trades.
The shares amounted to 2.77% to 131.60 and the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore has discovered the sale of $2.5 billion as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of the debt of $30 billion.
The company sold new shares at the price of 125 yilli for action, with 2.4% less than the closing price of March.
He dropped out of the company 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
The concern over the rise in the Chinese economy in long-term stagnation led to a substantial increase in prices in the coal mine, with approximately half, and the coal, copper and other goods decreased by 20-40%.
Xi insists on expanding the economy at global level
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reformed group that the economy needs to open up more to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must undertake to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve open policy," Xi said, during the 16th Meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Follow-up of General Reforms (Central Leadership Group for Deopening Overall Reform).

I'm extremely happy that I got to this stage to give the start of the football Academy that gave me my name.
For me, it's extremely important to find talented children, who can play football without having to worry about material training.
They have to be the only thing to worry about: that's to play the football as well.
Technical details should not be taken care of.
They have to value the talent.
This is what you want to do'Paul Papp's Football Academy.
"I also wait for Prime Minister Costan Morar at the first election of the children, to show them that it's their tools," said photographer Papp for the dejean.ro.

If you want us to formalize the Congress's ruling, we will do the same.
There won't be any emotions about this.
"There have been no elements, party voices, party opinions that would give the government an insecure one or that would give some impression that someone in the party does not want PSD to join the government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragne said at the end of the seventh session of the National Bureau of the PSD.

An Italian was arrested at Bors vama with immigrants hiding in TIR
Two citizens from Sri Lanka were deported, months, to the Bors Valley, while trying to cross the illegal border, hiding in the middle of a highway led by an Italian citizen.
Following the investigations carried out, it was established that the two of them would pay for EUR 4,000 to be transported to France, reports the Frontier Police.
At the specific control, border police observed, in the truck’s cabin, a large herd of birds, where they find personal things for more people, because they have performed a beloved control over the means of transport.
On this occasion, border politicians discovered, hidden in the middle of the highway, through plastic beams, two persons from six men.
Checks have resulted in the fact that the persons in the cause, two barbitals, in the age of 28, are citizens from Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
"The researchers, young people, have declared that they intend to reach France, because they have been linked to a relative, through the heart they have reached the Italian subject, which has been offered to carry them to their destination, where they will receive EUR 2,000 per person", says the Frontier Police Communication.
The two migrants were involved in "fighting the penalty in the way of saving the corruption of the attempt to bring fraud to the state border".
Also, Pompeo B., the Italian citizen in the 45-year-old age who led a brand-marked brand Renault Magnum, registered in Romania, which transports plastic beams for an Italian firm, was detained for 24 hours, after being presented to the White Court with preventive arrest proposals.
How happy the Romans are in marriage: Barbatis versus women

The situation is slightly different when the responses of both boys and women are analysed separately.
Thus, 28% of boys are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% satisfied, 6% very unhappy and 8% unsatisfied users.
In terms of women, 33% were declared satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very unhappy, 14% unsatisfied users and 19% chose the appropriate category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we'll see that the boys are more satisfied.
In terms of neutrality, we see a difference of two percent.
"As well as in the very unhappy situation, the difference is the biggest recorded in the user's dissatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 per cent," it is further shown in the Communication.
The study has shown that a range of Romans (26%) spends an hour or even less together, 18% spends between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The most transmitted study performers are "Romans need more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safe (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, belief 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, important 14%, invasion 12%, liberty 11%, self-conscious 10% and control 7%".

I kept working, everything got very well and probably changed, and he also changed his ideas.
That's what I wanted to go.
If you don't want to show up, I've offered them a deal.
We have about 400 and a thousand euros a year, so I have about 600 billion euros.

American Nick Hess was kidnapped by his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filmed him when he was pregnant, he could barely get on his feet, and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old boy said he didn't drink alcohol, it was obvious he was in a state of Hebrews.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without being drunk, I thought he was crazy.
"So friends and family thought 'maybe like a single drink, it's a secret alcoholic'," she says, according to Mirorr.
When he saw his wife's films with him, the slaves from Columbus, Ohio, just didn't recognize him: "I looked in my eyes and I wasn't there."
He was an intruder, I didn't remember anything.
In addition, his wife, who, although doubted some time of him, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembered as well as Nick's breath smelled alcohol.
The moment he put Nick on the top of his arms was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he discovered that he had an alcoholic three times over the legal limit, although at night before he consumed only one beer.
After years of research without number, Nick found himself suffering from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-Brewery Syndrome".
Practically, the body or makes all the carbohydrates consumed to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who insisted that this might be Nick's disease was even his wife.
The disease doesn't have a leukemia yet, and since he gave up on carbohydrates, Nick hasn't had that kind of episode.

The surprise has appeared when the dealer who bought the machine didn't solve the problem, as he agreed.
The government approved, Wednesday, "National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "a step in which Romania is engaged in modernising the immigration process on the national territory", according to a press release.
The above approach shows that the strategy aims to manage the immigration phenomenon effectively, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and policy guidelines at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by Romania's neighbouring states, there is considerable evidence for unitary and coherent management of the situations that may have occurred in the territory of Romania, resulting from situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time will pay particular attention to citizens from countries with potential migrants or who can bring national security to their senses," adds the remembered source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can affect immigration and asylum, while the reduction of the conflict in Syria, the re-activation of the conflict in Iraq, the reduction of an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), the perpetuation and increase in the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets out and some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more stringent controls on the legality of third-country nationals in Romania, and the corresponding application of the departments and restrictive measures, the improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy also contains specific objectives relevant to the transfer and implementation of general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to third-country nationals who meet the needs of the labour force, favouring third-country nationals access to higher-invatant institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficits.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it represents "a means of establishing concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system to stop the migrationist phenomenon found in growth".

The activity report of the TVR driver, rejected by the Commission: Stelian Tanase risk
Parliament's cultural commissions rejected the activity report of the Council of Management of the Romanian Television Society in 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 parliamentarians voted against the opposition (Senmarker Varujan Vosganian) and one withdrew.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus of the United States.
These will decide, probably next week.
The next round will be discussed.
"I believe that in view of this situation, it will be made relatively soon," said the President of the Senate's Committee on Culture, Georgica Severin.
He added that "good sense" as well as TVR driving should be present at this sitting, provided that no representative of TVR driving was present at the meeting of the Cultural Commissions.
It was good to be presenting TVR driving because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation has been made among CA members since evening, with an hour or so close that we don't know now, but today, after the meeting of the United Bureaus, we have sent a fax to the TVR driving.
I think that at the moment you're called, you're being budgeted, paid out of public taxes, and you're summoned to a meeting of the committees even if you don't like to come.
"While it is your duty to serve, you are in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after sitting with the Committees on Culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed during the session on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees on Budgets.
The figures we saw as they continued, came with the idea that this year would have been the day, but they didn't pay for the history.
"I remind you that neither of my fault nor of any of these commissions have lost that deal with banks and taxes, there are clear management problems," Severin explained.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary, the next election will be for a new Administrative Board, and this will be elected by the Director-General of the Institute.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
The minions won't do it.
It is important to make political decisions in order for this institution to function.
I'm not the man who's lying, I'm gonna say there's gonna be a genius who's gonna stay here and hit.
I hope that those who decide, the Parliament's plenary, by their vote, to vote with a lot of courage on people who will drive TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of justice and respect for the girl of the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what quality you have to have - I feel good about the girl of employees because it's a curse from the employees, the ads, the concessions.
"When you're also getting 50, 60, 70, it's scary and we're talking about the financial situation that's a disaster," said the President of the Senate's Committee on Culture.
Although not presenting it to Parliament, the President-General of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the House of Members, Valerius Zgonea, requesting that Parliament take into account a series of measures that could lead to the saving and guaranteeing of the independent economic and political life of public television, by counting and reducing TV taxes.
In writing, Stelian Tanase requests, along with the indexing of TV taxes, the modification and completion of HG 978/2003 for the public television service, in order to update the provisions at the level of technology changes per day, as well as for the regulation of the control procedure in the field of TV taxes and the finding of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision which provides for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTV's mandate for the collection of TV taxes, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission of inquiry.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for public television and CNC-specific activities from 15% to 3%, but also for the amendment of law 41/1994, in order to receive budgetary/finance allocations for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sports events - World Football Championship, Gold Cerbul, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will enter into payment in the following months, in view of the fact that the labour law obliges the employee to execute the judges, even if they are not final, and wage rights are given priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce costs with staff and TV production.
"This has reduced transfers and other cost-generating activities, renegotiated a series of commercial contracts, and, at the end of July, TVR News was closed," said the President.
Tanase appreciates that the devastating financial situation cannot be corrected only by its own efforts.
"With the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman TV will be found, sooner or later, in the inability to carry out the public mission," he wrote.
The Board of Governors decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
The generations of Vasile Blaga, sent to court
The generals of Vasile Blaga, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, were sent to the trial, Wednesdays, of the prosecutors of the Park along the Court of Apple Bucharest.
This is accused of tax exaggeration, in a file with a loss of approximately 600,000 euros, is subject to judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on 22 May.
This established the Axis Corporate Security SRL, his mother's nursery in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
Research has raised the fact that, in order to eliminate taxes and taxes from the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in security service providers would have created an infractional circuit, a form of more commercial companies, through which fiscal transactions would have been shown.
"In fact, the company's accounting would have been registered for the physical purchases of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being so damaged by approximately 600,000 euros," the Roman police explained in a press release.
You know, Sanmartean's boat's stable.
The Al-Ittiqad's sixth club has established middleman Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean de Ittihad's deployment is imminent, the founder of the former Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will no longer happen.
Boloni is very much from Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the title game of games and does it good.
The Sections also realized that he was the best and that he would have been wrong if he gave up on him.
It would have been more option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been more discussions, such as with Mbark Boussofa, but nothing has been specified," said Zaporojanu for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittiqad at the beginning of this year.
Ilie Sarbu was elected Vice-President of the Court of Auditors
Parliament voted in favour of the appointment of PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, Vice-President Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authorities of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes "for" and 108" were registered.
The vote was secret, with the ballots.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, the Digi24 report.
On the other hand, the liberals criticized Sarbu's name in this regard and announced that they would reply to the CCR, under the conditions in which he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu is available for 30 days, according to the law, to leave the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors is no longer allowed to make politics.
The PSD Senator will act as Vice-President of the Audit Authorities of the Court of Conturi, free of charge following the rejection of Ioan Anton, as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which he found to be non-constitutional.
Surprise from one of the most sexy actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper continues to play the role of a boxer in the "Burnt" film, the actor made a disvaluation to which he should not expect.
In a recent interview, it said that it grew more and more in the kitchen: "I've worked a lot of my life as a cook."
This was devalued as working in the kitchen for 15 years, when it worked for a Greek restaurant, so then, in college, it would continue the same way.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so the entire child was born with a beautiful Italian, related to ContactMusic.
Asked what plans of the future had in that period, Bradley Cooper said that he was never the guy to make plans in five years, "not even two."
"It's not very encouraging for me to have a card," said he.
"I see, the things you hate if I tell you," he said more, claiming that what he wanted from childhood was involved.
Ajuns at the age of 40, the actor recognized himself as seeing himself in the near future, following Clint Eastwood's model, which was attacked by the entire region at that time.
Point, accused of uncontrollable waves and inadvertent claims
Foreign Minister Hungarian Peter Szijjarto condemned hard, Wednesday morning, the statements of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to Hungarian political decisions are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other camps from which refugees fled".
" Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his inalienable statements, Jingneste throughout Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister sent an emancipation to a communiqué.
European civilised politicians don't say that kind of uncontrollable slogans.
"His comments have only one explanation: he lost total support in Romania's internal policy," added the head of the Hungarian diplomat, according to the MTI.
In a post on Facebook last night, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that he wanted to draw attention and punish the conduct of Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "is a Russian for the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not want to respond to the provocations that come from some Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a Russian for the culture and values of the European Union; and in the anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis," Ponta explained on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that it is the adoption of rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, considering that the brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Sarma gimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and violence will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than Syria, Libya or other refugees!
"Faith in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and in particular in European values - which we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values," the Roman executive stressed.
Last Tuesday, Foreign Minister of Hungary, Peter Szijjarto, qualified for "simply lies" the comments of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, stating that these statements are not for a leader in the twenty-first century, according to the MTI.
The head of the Hungarian diplomat also mentioned Tuesday that the "extremely and false remarks" of the Romanian prime minister have been of the internal political crisis in Romania and explained that Budapest is waiting for forgiveness from the Roman side.
Sijjarto referred to a statement made months ago by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've said and say always is that I'm against the xenophobic talks the idea of closing the borders, like all those who come are terrorists, they're stupid about the Middle Ages and I'm totally against this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get, the problem is our logistics capacity to treat these people as some people, not how it treats our magic neighbors, with battle and insulation.
"This is not agreed," said the Roman executive chief, in a press conference at Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest decided to launch ground-wide preparations for the extension of the guard’s border with Romania, which he built at the border with Serbia, to make possible changes in the route used by migrants.
In addition, Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that the Hungarian decision to raise a guard on the granite does not solve any of the refugee problems and "escape Hungary from Europe".
What is the link between Osama bin Laden and the macaral storm from Mecca
The Saudi authorities announced that the healthy giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "part of responsibility" for the destruction of a macaral, Friday, at the Mose Sea of Mecca, which happens after the fall of 107 people died.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company did not "responsive to security rules", related to a health-care agency (SPA), a BBC report.
The company's catalogues have received a ban to stop smoking until the investigation is completed in this case.
The company will also be excluded from our public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father after 80 years and is now led by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group worked for 4 years at Mari Mosche's extension, so that he could earn more money.
The accident occurred last night, during a storm, when a macara, probably decalibrated by powerful waves of wind, was blocked on the eastern side of Mary Mosche's cover from Mexico.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How to Inquisit the Hagi Contestants
Considered by many the largest Roman footballist in history, Gica Hagi was labelled, after withdrawal from activity, as a weak coach, which cannot be able to perform performance and in the new post.
After an unhappy experience with the national team, Steaua or Galatasararay, Hagi took over after a year the training role of the Constanta Vitor, the team whose patronage is.
After a year of the team's conquest, the King proved that he was able to transform a team that fought for the rescue of the retrograde into one of the tops.
Thus, after one year, the Vitor registered, with Hagi trainer, 16 winners, 11 remixes and 11 infraggers.
The balance is one of the top team, which is hit by European shoes.
The events took a turn and better for the Future in this season, led by the team arrived at the second place in League 1, with 19 points, one smaller than the leader Astra Jourgiu.
The future also has the best attack on League 1, with 20 gold (as equal to Astra), more than double than Steaua.
On the other hand, even if he brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued to promote youth, and in the last period in the start team, names such as Janis Hagi or Hodorogea have appeared.
The club policy has made a follow-up team for foreign teams from the Future, so that Hagi sold EUR 1.5 million in this round - Janis Hagi (Fiorentina - EUR 1 million) and Alexander Mitita (Barri - EUR 500 billion).
Steaua's Alatus, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to the data from the Comert Registry.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has been playing as a small trick.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the EU's shadow.
High rates come with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the directorate of the European Centre for Political Affairs.
In an interview offered by Zaire.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a force, and the means by politicians will not function in this crisis: "Maybe we have a double daughter of the quality of the values these people come with."
But these are the masses that have begun and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality that we need to adapt as best we can and adapt it to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we find ourselves at an extremely emotional moment where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it has passed, Europeans will not be willing to give up on the free movement, so the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created at another time and which was not adapted to the situation now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis following this JAI advice that has actually not resolved anything?
It is clear that EC President Donald Tusk did not want to strengthen a vote in the Council.
All forecasters said they'd have the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity shall apply to JAI and any State may block any decisions.
Therefore, things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and internal affairs.
Following Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has an initiative, and the Council adopted a 55% vote of the state, namely 16, representing 65% of the EU's population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it is a sensitive issue, reactions have appeared even in Germany against the opening policy of Chancellor Merkel, and they did not want in many ways to appear as an "EU-based response".
They have done so, but there is a serious problem because, obviously, this valley creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably help to make big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory beds were not really removed, but the subject was just let go?
Yes, on the other hand, it is about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change in the individual responsibility of the members who are at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also bordering Germany with Turkey, and this valley of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
Maybe it's due to the Dublin principle, according to the love of migrants, the responsibility of the state in which it enters first, because it's not sustainable.
If Greece is capable, you can't finally say it's Greece's business.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve without a specific mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, to share the first effort?
No one knows exactly how the compulsory charges will work, if they'll get to them.
Because you're having a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to blame Romania or Portugal, or Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will be called to take over migrants: you go in X direction or Y direction.
It is likely that it will reach some unique filtering centres, either in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
It's working on this kind of solution.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
They're like those who have ten years of experience trying to integrate migrants, they're so inexperienced, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will speed up the xenophob current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in the emergency camps and who have just started to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% of them claimed to leave, iron and hard to pass through the Mediterranean, but we were expecting the next year at a valley maybe even bigger.
What do we do with this people?
My guess is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look at it as much as we can see in the media.
Talk about art with less or less experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where it really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebs in Franta, the Turks in Germany, they're all trapped.
I wouldn't go to radical declarations.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other migration values, but this does not mean that they are not integrated at all.
It has created an integral part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the British Sea.
But half the police won't work.
Let's create the strength of Europe and an illusion.
The integration mechanisms in European societies must be included.
Here were some steps.
We need to be more careful.
Let us ask these people to invoke the language, try to take the values, not to hang out with a foot in Europe and with one of their origins, bringing the rest of the family, including by the weddings of the convention.
This problem of these people needs to be separated from the long-term problems of their integration.
If others have gone through long-term integration doesn't mean we have to look at them as they go through the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have a double girl of the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's an intervention in Syria, what I don't think, it doesn't mean it's going to be overnight and you can go back to it.
Before the sun shines, we see strength in Europe.
The granite is closed, the walls are lifted, they return to the border in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as an attack, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built sufficiently minimally and making rules so that the pressure was too large on the tracks in which these migrants put their foot for the first time.
I mean, we're moving freely from there, but each one has his problems.
In the face of such a value, it can't be, because some of these don't make the girl.
When there are also emotional values, politicians will show that they do something, but in the long term, it doesn't change much.
Following the warnings from France, we have no anti-terrorism legislation far more tragic in the EU than we had last year.
It's a valley of public emotion that is installed in both senses.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions on her basis.
We have a lot of talk, many Belgian statements from politicians at home under pressure to be violent.
And, then, you have the dramatic case of the child in Turkey and the public opinion gets excited.
After the public's emotions pass, we'll go back to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for the good.
This is the only real European road.
And I don't think that Europeans will give up on this principle of freedom of movement.
There'll be other rules and something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created at another time and was not adapted to the situation right now.
How has Romania been playing in this crisis so far?
As a little dragon, who thinks that, if he pulls his eyes out and there comes the ears, the theme disappears.
In view of the reality of the values of migrants, you can choose to be a part of the solution or to say it's not your problem.
We have done this, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as an EU citizen.
You're not, you're not playing at the high level.
Large prices come with solvents for the entire EU, good or bad, we are no longer discussing their quality.
That's how Poland did it.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite for the Roma for Schengen will fall very much.
President Johannis says it might be good that we haven't come in yet.
So we're going through the dispersion of the entrance to a more pragmatic position, but the target is the branch.
There is certainly a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.
What doesn't mean it's a reason we don't get into Schengen anymore, and we're getting more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but in the sense that external borders will be shared responsibility, it will be the only rules for the acceptance of migrants, the single rules for transportation for those who do not receive asylum, the single rules for safe fees.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia turned his attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a link between those two focusses, a game in Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks it's a great power to attack Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a link.
He made the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, probably the Assad regime would have been banned in the past.
And it's good to get drunk before the main or the opposition becomes the Islamic state.
For almost two years it has been a struggle between the Assad regime and the Latin and moderate Muslims, supported by the Gulf and the West.
Then the Islamic state grew up and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to be each.
Russia could make things complicated, but it can't take part in the solution.
She creates a flash of instability and chaos that can't shut them down.
But you're powerful only if you're the only one.
The game on off-side is just a strategy to win time.
It's probably Putin waiting to be offered, he's going to hit the button to solve the situation.
The offer doesn't come because the world is not convinced that it can solve in some way or other things created by it.
But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are manned by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin more powerful than he is.
What button will appear in the cursor
Millions of Facebook users have become familiar with the "Like" button, and now representatives of the socialization network are preparing another opus, the "Discile".
Marti, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available in cash, reports New York Times on blog.
Zuckerberg pointed out that the "Disli" button will show a deeper angle to what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised a problem that Facebook could become a little less friendly.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid the moments when someone was putting on an account or an important event in life, and someone else would give "Discile."
Network users, who reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long requested the opportunity to express their negative emotions or feelings with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg has already said that it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" some current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a dozen members of the family.
"You may not feel comfortable giving like those posters," said the Facebook representative.
The variant of a new button on Facebook has not been received well from all over the world.
"There is already a lot of hate on Facebook and socialization networks," commented Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article was posted with this subject.
"You'll give 'Disciple' the 'Disciple' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, insisted that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it's hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
More, she supports, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the "Discile" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants Tuesday, a man of thousands coming to her south border with Serbia, announced government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary announced its emergency during the day in two Jews across the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, covering a main point of crossing the border and announcing that it would build a wall at its border with Romania, DPA reminder.
Massura has delayed a brutal reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they're going to sign for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to eat salt.
"As you can see, this is completely different," said Serbian Minister for Refugees, Alexander Vulin.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, announced the police month.
In addition, more than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa had immigrated to Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and attempting to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "New" seat of the Jewish Council is on foot.
Two builders, insolvent
Massive investments done here over the past few years, in order to move the institution, can be attributed to the fact that they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here were insolvent during the work.
The seat of the Judiciary Council on the road Vasile Aleksandri will be set up on his own.
In one and a half years since the construction reconstruction and re-functional work had to be completed, the work had not reached half.
A last stage in the construction era was spent the past days when the National Contest Resolution Council (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to accept the contract for the implementation of the technical project for the most implemented work.
The initial project was surrounded by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, negotiations were cancelled without publishing an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, a signature to update the technical project and then to organise a new job bid.
"But the negotiations did not end with a contract, the CJ considers that the proposed form would be a disadvantage to the institution," Răzvan Timofcic quoted as a representative of the public relations in the CJ.
The CJ decision to interrupt direct negotiations was attacked by Impex Romcatel.
The court came out to send the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late as possible.
This does not mean, however, that CJ may start looking for another projector.
Impex Romcatel has the opportunity to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sense of it can be taken into account by calculating the finding of another projector.
Thus, building building building building construction could be repaired earlier in the coming year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the renewal of the technical project should not be long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We expect to see whether the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," said Timofciuc.
The consolidation work of the former Police Office began in 2011.
A first contract of employment was signed in April 2012, after a total of 4.5 million jobs were made.
The tender was cancelled, the contract was assisted by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency, and this contract was rejected, after payments of 1.5 million dollars were made.
The work has been done so far in proportion to approximately 50%.
Initial, consolidation, re-functionalisation and maintenance of the building was assessed at 7.7 million.
"Come on, I say everything!" -- a statement that could be criminalized by the former head of the Cadastr.
One of the employees involved in the scandal file from the Office of the Cadastrus signed an agreement on recognition of the facts against amnesty.
The most likely, his statements will condemn the other accused, in front of the former chief Narciza Nedelcu.
A consultant from the Office of Immobiliare and Publicity (OCPI) has been accused of DNA in a corruption file and has fully recognized it.
The agreement on recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was signed yesterday at the Iași Court, which decided to provide a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dascalu was accused of continuing intellectual errors and was agreed to perform two years in prison with amnesia, as well as work in the use of the community.
With regard to Dascălu's alleged facts, the prosecutors explained that it, as a consultant of the Cadsour Office, together with other colleagues, "has mistakenly concluded several acceptance processes, by selling service contracts previously concluded by O.C.P.I., with the administrators of SC Gausss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Topo Cad SRL, and PFA Jobs SRL and PFA Lipša Štefan, who claimed, in fact, that the services contracted were fully carried out, under conditions where they were not carried out and were not from O.C.P.Yaș".
The previous days, former chief of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other false or current OCP employees were sent to court in this file, the charges were to inform the said companies, although the work has not been carried out.
Before the trial, it's over 300,000.
Adventures in Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexander Dedu, Romania can only find a major handball contest in 2024, and the preparation of the national women's handball for qualifying the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
President of the Romanian Federation of Handball, Alexander Dedu, said yesterday, during a press meeting, that it is a great honour that our country has three teams in the Campus League groups.
With regard to Romania's national team of women's handball, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympic Games, but for this reason it must take two stages of caudien guns, first round the World Championship and second round the precalculation tournament," said Dedu.
We really want to qualify for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements on the part of the technical staff led by Thomas Ryde.
The staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two massages, a coach, a physical preparationer, a head of delegation.
They asked us to get some things, more precise material for physical preparation, which I never heard of.
All of this to get to the Olympic Games. And I'll do whatever it takes of me to get them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make a success.
Because at the moment we're at the time of preparation.
"The teams with which we are baptized have these materials and for some time," said Dedu, who has been trying to get the sums needed to buy these products from MTS and COSR.
President FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and to the possibility that our country would have a major handball competition.
We don't have room in Bucharest.
It is a problem of infrastructure and it is bad to be asked by a European gymnasium.
Let's not forget that in other places of the world, Olympics have been built all over a period of two years.
Before 1992, in the present Olympic region of Barcelona was a group of gonoes, and now it has become a repertoire of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympic organisation was successful and in terms of investments.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can find a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball agencies are willing to allow Romania to organise a major competition.
It's a priority for me to bring the major arms race to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but they complained very quickly that the room would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, we said we wanted to, we were able to organize and they said that they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new room in Bucharest and then we discussed specifically.
"So we have all the openings, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The big handballist has avoided assessing the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all trainers to be reserved for advances, that if they don't go back against them."
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rubies start on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, declared, on Tuesday, at a press conference, that all the components of the Roman battalion are ready for the games from the World Cup in England, where he hopes to get two winners: "We're ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with engines at the maximum speed.
We've been trained to give the best date in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are gray and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first time with France and then we'll see.
But certainly, if we win with Canada, the game with Italy will be our end.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the gathering of so many years of work.
I want me not to disappoint any of the gang members and come with beautiful results at home.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like the ruby in Romania, represented by the tricolor mountain," said Macovei.
The Romanian national team's electorate, Lynn Howells, found in the first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the rugby election: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it's very important that every game make the Romans proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Federation of Rugby, Haralambi Dumitraș, believes that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I want the sportsmen to succeed, and I'm sure we'll be at the end of the event.
"These guys started playing in the Romanian teams at the age of 18-19, so there's cohesion, is a band of friends, who has decided to make a dream," Dumitraş said.
At the World Cup of rugby in England, Romania will evolve in Group D, having programmed the following games: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition begins tomorrow, at the Twickenham Stadium in London, with the game England - Fiji in Group A.
New Japanese cultural courses organized at Al.I. Cuza University
You can learn about the arrangement of flowers in a vacuum, picture in a shower, but also a lesson about the beautiful art of the country of the Rásare Sun.
The Search for Japanese Culture Students in Iaşi organises new courses of Japanese culture (kiban, summie and beautiful art) in October 2015 - June 2016, both for beginners and warned people.
These will take place at the Centre of European Studies of the University of Al. I. Cuza in Iaşi and are organized to promote Japanese, traditional and modern art and culture.
For this, there is only one 50-year-old share rate per person.
In addition to art lessons, participants will be able to participate in exhibitions and other cultural activities to promote beauty.
The Japanese culture courses I proposed to you were designed as an invitation, addressed to the general public, to make the first steps on the road to self-consciousness through art.
"The interested persons will be able to find out how to realize the creation of the harmonious floral (kibana), how to surprise the soul of the enchanting elements in plastic compositions using the Japanese art of painting in the tube (Sumie) or how to express their individuality and creativity through the multivalent universe of beautiful art (graphic, design, picture),” said Sorin Mazilu, professor of these courses.
The courses are addressed to all who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
The subscriptions take place by 30 September, and those who want to request more information can do so by telephone number: 0742.027.153 or by e-mail: studentcultura@gmail.com.
14 million you give to the Hospital "Sf. Spiriton" from Iaşi to budget correction
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The hospital "Sf. Spiriton" received from the Ministry of Health, after budgetary correction, about 14 million of them.
The money that the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and threat of clinics, but also in the medical equipment and technique for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograf computer, with a new radiology device, with six pipes used for surgical intervention, six ATI patents with a corresponding, ophthalmotic microscop and other necessary devices to perform the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million of the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and threat of "Marelai Ars".
Out of the money from bunarian rectification, the UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of modernization works in the main throne.
"In addition, the following days we will receive work from the hospital that connects the UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the proper transport of the PU disease in nearby clinics," the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have a doctorate and a clinic for dermatology from Tatarashi, which will organise it in the ambulance, in the same way that this works at present.
The clinic will function in the area where allergology, haematology and endocrinology are found in the ambulance and will have approximately 30 patients.
The ice, made of RATP controllers and a plaintiff.
The passion of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iaşi to visit him, but the trip ended with a terrible promise.
After the experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to go to your city again.
Without it, they've been hit by the stolen information from the floor, by the neglect of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by a "if the law says so."
The women arrived in Iaşi a few days later, they settled in a hotel in the Centre and asked for a tourist beach.
They also received a complaint in which the RATP tracks were passed.
"Dears" with these papers, the wives visited Iaşul.
But, after two days, found in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because it wasn't played with tickets in the parking lot near Parcul Copou, they were based on the information printed on the floor: that I can take the tickets via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Trusters in the fuel, they moved into a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the fuel.
Unfortunately for them, he made a team of RATP controllers appear.
They said that there was no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
The EU is one of the things that's written in the local press, I'm coming with the night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I told them the situation, they said they didn't pass, it wasn't their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all I can do is give us one change instead of 2 (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to keep my day of visit standing at the jandarmerie and giving the declaration there!" says Ovidius.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of the information spread by the plaintiff and the controllers who "applyed the law to blood".
It's not right, and I made a seat at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not exaggerated by many, but the idea is that I felt isolated.
Ghinion for Vaslui's rapists.
They had an accident and remained in a preventive arrest.
The process of the seven Violators from Vaslui was moved to the Court of Appeal yesterday.
Outlaws judged the first term of trial in a non-public sitting where seven young people accused of having beaten an 18-year-old asked to be released.
Before the very beginning of the trial sitting, one of the judges who had been distributed to him, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for arrest, which was approved by his colleagues at the court.
The judge was active until this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Nale Section, who, on 9 April, admitted a dispute formulated by four of the accused, having their arrest at home.
Currently, the document is judged by a complete one that is part of the U.S. and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the document, he had written a statement by Judge Dan An ton, because his daughter was in a relationship with one of the lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslui's rapists would continue to be in preventive arrest.
Your niggers will remain in prison for at least 30 days, when the Jews will reexamine their chances of being released.
The final judgment will take place at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal of Iaşi, the dubs that were transported by the rapists in Vaslui were involved in an accident produced in the Pacuri cartel, the car entering Iaşi in the hundreds.
The Iveco car with which the seven rapists were transporting hit a Volks Wagen bus that came out of the Canta street, and the driver tried to turn to the left.
Double circle in the end of the Purchasing.
The car entered Yaşi here because the employees of the Prisoner Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iaşi on the Grajduri, then on the hundredth floor.
They've been down that way in a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the arresters called another transport to take possession.
Recently, at the scene, a car was sent from the Supreme Security Penitentiary Iaşi, who took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrests were injured.
To move them to the other side, the guards turned the back of their cars, and the arrests came out fast, two and two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the cars have come to understand the damage they have to pay," said Commissioner Madāranu, under the IPJ.
Marile Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say from the outset, clearly and accurately: neither of the 7000 refugees who should and should be naturalised Romania represents, in itself, a insignificant number, but growing compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, is very much above the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Surely, if those migrants will even agree to establish themselves in our communities, the chances of rapidly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
The parasite of interlocutors and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Roman state proves invaluable in all areas.
The ability to integrate into the media is just a simple example.
In addition, governments of any colour have not been able to absorb European funds, make modern roads, buildings or schools, provide decent medical assistance, strengthen road traffic, create honorable paid jobs, or keep their own young generation home.
Why would refugees be established in another country where they are fleeing?
But what produces a lot of ambition is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt.
We are fighting at the beginning of the Belgian leadership of the EU's strong states, which gives the greatest evidence of generosity when it comes to sharing the difficulties with smaller countries.
Then comes the horrendous hypocrisy of the Romans who, although they have millions of rubies bought across the world, do not yet accept it in another language, in another religion, in another blood.
I'm probably afraid he doesn't steal any national property.
Finally, there is also an hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although calling for only the horrors of the war as a cause of departure, does not accept the destination of exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
In addition, the simple way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken into consideration.
The causes need to be eliminated, support some and, focusing strictly on the political justice letter, seek peace and investment for countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are you leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has appeared to us as an abandoned, decombined and overstated construction.
We argued that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but this is why the EU does not have any future plan.
And improvisation and threats do not help.
What, then, does the EU use, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romania - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the values of refugees crossing borders as a branch?
At some point, the war in Syria will be over.
But not the crisis of migrants.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource abuse, etc. will push millions of displaced migrants from Asia and especially from Africa to a better life.
With politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.
Seven thousand euros per year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, practice, tax
The tender for concession is for a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of closure, the club at the Roman Library Court is offered by the Judiciary Council for a period of 10 years.
The building has a useful surface of 134 mp, on two levels of curves.
CJ accepts that the destinations of the building are only those of the literature, library or other activities with a cultural profile.
The building was assessed at EUR 68,300, the value of the bid being EUR 6,830 per year, with a 25-euro bid step.
The concessionor will have to continue and continue to operate the building and cover the entire cost of rehabilitating the furniture, in accordance with the technical project to be completed.
"The construction of the Pogor Club is in progress because of the fact that during the period in which the public food unit was operating in these areas and no further evacuation of it has been carried out in the repair and maintenance work as urgently as necessary during the operation of a building", says the relevant documentation of the tender procedure.
The club concession offers are expected until 18 September.
Two brothers from Tomeshti have buried dreams.

They're stable, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years he received a brave but courageous: biological parents
Lost in a hospital in the dark of the '90s, when it had only two months of life, small, sick and unequipped, and then adopted by a family established in Italy, in the same year when the adoption was regulated, a young, beautiful girl, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met strangers in Iaşi with biological parents from a courthouse, after almost two decades in which no one else knew anything else.
Crina will fill these 20-year-old days, and her adoptive parents from Palermo thought to offer their beloved daughter a gift of love and courage: a visit to Romania, Iaşi, to know the dark past.
"Iaşi's Zaire", who attended the search efforts of the family of origin after some extreme vowels, was a witness to these meetings that actually broke your heart.
Reporting reports, emotions of the moment, statements of the parties involved, their reactions are of the right to move and collapse.
The story of Crine is starting 20 years ago in the outlying village of Ruginosa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital in town.
At home there were disagreements between parents, and Mother had to leave home.
He's decided to keep the girl, and I'm supposed to be sent home.
She stopped the girl, and I haven't known anything since then.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the biological mother of the girl.
Crina was interviewed together with her grandmother at the Pașcani municipal hospital, and still the daughter's father, Costa Rica, went to work in Alexandria, Judge Teleorman.
Their veins had to disappear definitively.
They haven't found Crina in the hospital yet.
After the entrance, the father of Crine went to work elsewhere, and he returned six months later.
In the meantime, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iaşi, and the father, when he came back, found her no more.
I think it's been about nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"It's thought she's abandoned," says a family story.
Because of financial problems, the grandmother was unable to come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one had any interest in the child’s welfare at all this time, she was taken by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection of Iaşi, who then took care of the Center for Plasament in Bucium.
It was years in which apostasy and adoption were more regulated today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They loved the place of the Crina blond, and after some time they had to finally move with them in Italy.
The small case has been committed for almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities have lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt that she was our daughter.
"It's like my wife would have given her life," says Salvadore, the adoptive father, while he's holding in the palm of his daughter's palm.
In the country, the parents of Crine, Alina and Costa Rica have continued to separate their search wherever they could.
The father asked the Ruginosa authorities, but he didn't get any answers where his child could be.
The police then sent her that it's possible to be fired, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I was looking for her here, they told the Tribunal that she was leaving for Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions for looking for it were gone.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've been thinking about her all the years, but it wasn't possible to calm down, to find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of Crine's biological mother.
But even if years have passed, the parents of Ruginosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvador and her wife explained to the girls where she came from and that her past was a link from Romania.
I was small when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted as a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to get to know my parents in Romania," Crina laments.
And her vision is coming true.
In March of this year, Commissioner Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Counsellor Antidrog Iași, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, which explained Salvador's desire to find the biological family of Crine.
And the search only started by a name.
After the request we had from our Italian partners, we started the first time.
We just got a name, Balcan Costa, then the locality, Ruginosa.
In a short time, I had a primary activity out there, and I could ask if there was a local name received.
Then they gave me some clues, just because the person found wasn't the one who was looking.
"It lasted until about a month before we found the daughter's biological father," explains Roman chief Ichim.
In total, it was better for three months to get the authorities to find Costa Rica and Alina, especially that everyone had the house in another location.
We started somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that in September there would be a first meeting," added Roman Ichim.
In the weekend last week, Alina and Costac saw her for the first time lost her daughter on the hospital halls of Iaşi, after 20 years.
The father, excited, could hardly master his tears, and his hands would shake forever.
She just changed a few words to those around her.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't sleep too much.
It was all excited, it's scary.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," she tells us once again, she and Costa Rica from Ruginosa.
Meeting with mother and biological brothers
In his discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-known university in Italy, Costa Rica Balcan told her, in other words, that if she ever wanted to come back to him, she would come quietly: she could give him something, caprito, to find a boy from the house and to bury a householder.
Mom is and she's excited, crying, and she's hard to believe that something like this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think something like this could happen.
I've seen such cases on television, I've been thinking about these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we'll see you in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," she tells us with great tears on the works of Alina, mother of Crine, while a servant keeps his side in his hand.
In him he's still hiding his tears, happy, because soon he'll see her daughter after so much time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will fill up in just a few days, this month, 20 years old, is trying to relax like an emotional child.
He doesn't know what to expect, but he sent out an empty idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now he's trying to get his mind together before the meeting, because he's got a lot to say, but nothing to say.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are up to the end of those who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina congratulates us.
First family meeting in Iaşi
In the United States, under the beginning of the fall, the Ruginosa family reunites their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing her school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costa, her biological parents.
No more borders or lands, but only one barrier: the language.
Through which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iaşu, has passed through easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that, in the future, if the opportunity becomes more open, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this sort organized, of an emotional charge, and I'm glad to be successful.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, people who depend on drugs.
But we're trying to save society something good back.
"If you'll be asked for such an event, I'll do it with great respect," says the director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Antidrog Iași.
In his back, the Balcan family, with Crina in the middle, turns out to be exciting.
I understand: they've got a lot to say to each other.
Armistice at the foot, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everybody takes his soul
The tables from the front office of the PSD have ended up with a gun at the foot.
Following successive rounds of discussions, held by Friday until Sunday, first being and most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to suspend the hostilities temporarily.
Pressing the party's executive president, Livio Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing social democracys will send it a full list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Apart from being closed, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only one break to allow the combatants to draw their souls.
The dragon didn't give a finale.
He launched a very simple and very current message under current conditions: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in existing structure," said the prime minister, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend debate have only led to the conclusion that nothing has been established.
At the October elections, close competition is expected for the function of the President of the PSD judicial branch.
The short list of potential candidates for the main function of the party's ex-Office is the State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazăr, Judge Vasile Cátea and the interim President of the Judiciary Council, Victor Lupu.
This could also be added to the Prime Minister of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the application of the leader of the PSD judge, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer be enrolled in the course, sources from the party claiming that it is not interested in function.
The only name not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is the former head of the branch, Prime Minister Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, including on the election day, candidates can be filed, and no one would see if this would happen.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new Jewish Permanent Bureau and all the new leadership structures," explained the House.
Until the internal elections are organised, the management of the judicial branch of the PSD will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichit and Stanciu.
However, the Lupu is granted until 29 September, the preparation of the elections following practice is ensured by the Executive Secretary of the branch, Judge Mihail Popescu, found in the recent relationship with Nikita taba.
On the phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions over the past few days as going to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It has reached a partial consensus, in support of a unitary team to be held in court.
"We, on the other hand, have more options about the candidates' intentions related to the PSD Iaşi presidency, the list remains open," Stancius commented.
A judge came out to refuse the files of the Violators of Vaslui for concubinage
The seven young people of Vaslui's court condemned for violence arrive today at the Court of Appeal of Iaşi.
Vaslaws sentenced to sentences between five and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments for their release today, after the Court of Justice, Vaslui, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of the last week, Judge Dan Anton, making a request for an arrest, approved by his colleagues.
Anton called on the fact that one of the prosecutors, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's conjugation, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luke defends Silvio Ovidius Burada, who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the Sentitors Encouraged the Conscience
At the end of the last week, the judge of the Vaslui Judiciary, who condemned the seven young people, motivated the feeling.
The judge was moved to speak of the challenger's reaction to the offenders, but also to those who supported them, explaining that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation within the public opinion.
"The Court finds that after the time of the imposition of the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom, but not of privacy, under the influence of the attitude of the accused, their families and their local supporters, has been subjected to a strong sense of indignation at the local and national level as regards the fact that persons accused of serious facts are judged under a less restrictive measure," said the Court of Justice of Vaslui.
In addition, the magistrates have also deposed the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial called for the fact that the girl they raped would not be a "church door".
"The Authority underlines that it is not relevant to the moral quality of the victim, the aspect that the offenders want to highlight by means of the defences they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," it is further stated.
Corbyn, Brexit and Europe's Future
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years cannot continue the same in the following years.
Until Saturday a few people probably knew in Romania who's Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, even after he became the new leader of the British Laburist Party, many wonder how the election of a politician may affect us, which is consequently not in a position to make a decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leader of the post-war labs.
Marxist declared, anti-monarhist (he asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to expel the royal family from Buckingham Palace), an anti-American anti-American and a sympathetic Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by Russia Today's television channel), and the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wanted Britain to abandon nuclear weapons and get out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered Osama bin Laden's murder to be a true tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
After the model of all popular democracies, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things of the kind he told them and promised them and Tsipras in Greece until he broke up with the real world and economic legitimacy.
The economic programme of the new Laburist leader provides, inter alia, massive renationalisations and money-printing as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to printing money is not adopted unanimously on the globe, I then have a global prosperity!, but who is more able to prevent such details.
Of course, we can take blood on the bankers, become a kind of enemy of the left, but as it has been seen so often, not only in the former Communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Holland.
The additional amounts are quickly closed by generous promises, without covering, made by popular demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher well drew attention, "the problem of socialism is that at some point the other money ends."
I give little Jeremy Corbyn the real chance he'll ever get a prime minister.
At the beginning of the 1980s another left radical leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in beliefs as the next leader of the party, failed to vote.
And then there is still a working class in the British Sea, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant in the assembly of the workforce, and extensive automation has made it necessary for the industry to have a massive high-quality job, Corbyn's return has a limited call.
But even from opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its final financial number, Corbyn's election is considered to increase the chances of Brexit, with the release of the British Mary from the EU.
The new Laburist leader was an opposition to the country's presence in the Union.
In the eyes of Brussels radically, it is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by radical law, with retiring anti-immigrants and looking at the crisis of refugees who are displaced from the EU's foundations, you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for the Great Britain.
However, if the British decide after the referendum, which should take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep mistakes created within this euro crisis and therefore the refugees, between the North and the South, between East and West, leave a place for the most worrying scenarios.
With so much more than for a whole series of Member States, London was a resistance to the French-German axis (where Berlin is becoming increasingly dominant).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of the country's stay in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer the last one.
There are a lot of sensations, which grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I have just recently had a show in Jean Claude Junker's speech, tends to make major decisions over the heads of the majority of Member States by consulting just a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens under the conditions in which electoral support for pre-systemal training, anti-immigrants at the same time and eurosceptic growth is reflected throughout the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative loading has reached higher levels than ever before.
Where and the conclusion that financial Times throws it when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a recent calculation that leaves national interest.
If the voters will make the decision brain, then the Great Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
But Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as it is expected, we will contribute to a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will lead most of the countries in the region and to the periphery of interest and to that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Siriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds on popular returns from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed over the past ten years, the general social benefits can no longer continue in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by urgent decisions which have not been taken in the calculation of the integrationist political ambitions, and the ability and availability of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect the Roma situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of the possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to face such complex situations.
Constantin Brancuis, the god of the country.
Rockefeller, "How can I help you?"
Brancuzzi, "Take and destroy the workshop!"
The sculptor Mary had a great desire: to be a man, to attain to glory, to hear about him all over the world.
In the back of his reputation, however, something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered, networks for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "do."
What do you write about Constantine Brancusi?
What else is it, actually?
The picture showed up on the banknotes.
And, recently, a known bank in Romania hired an actor to play in a advertising clip.
Whites produce and deliver money for nearly 60 years since it's not through us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of stars and flowers that call their names.
In other words, even the author of this text lives on one of these stars.
And when he comes out with the age, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to the Brancusi."
The country is replaced by its statues.
There are a few romantic personality traits to be known by such a world, from children to adults.
The capacity to infiltrate Brancusi is enormous.
Neither the communists managed to get him out of Romania's memory and culture.
Its readers are spreading the Internet today, getting hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what would it be to say, to write about this man?
Visiting from the collection of books and articles that try to rebuild their destiny, Brancuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, these are the people who tell you that, if you weren't lucky to be born in any big city and in a family as strong as you are, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancuși's life is a perfect example.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe we should start the next text from here.
With a sense of humor, they're all disgusting.
Look at the real success stories, which are delivered daily in newspapers and on television.
Watch this man's face carefully.
Do you want to know how to live, how, today, he heard a whole map?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobija, a small village in the village of Peštișani, Judge Gorj, on the sides of the Carpathies.
He is the fifth child of Mary and of Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although it comes from a family of supported countries, Brancusi leads a modest life, but one of them had to choose the repertoires that would guide his artistic vision later.
Recalling her childhood and the places in which she grew up, the artist had to witness, at a meeting with Peter of the country from Paris in 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious."
Of the millions, people went, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went quiet from one anomaly to the other.
And you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the big city has reached us.
But Brancus's childhood was far from an idiot.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of years spent in the native village.
The moment is played in the work "Brancuși. A biography", written by Alexander Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brancusi was three years old.
In the autumn of that year, when it was "the case", followed by those who cut the liquid to see if the process was done properly, Brancusi takes a moment of general concern.
He fills his search for palm trees with milk and drink on unspoiled leaves.
It's falling asleep almost instantaneously.
The first people are watching in just a few minutes.
Mom goes into the panic, then into the stomach, believing her son died.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from his life with tears, he sees the desperate signs of those waiting for him with his breath in his mouth.
The party turns into a jay right away.
Dad's already thinking about the crowd.
However, someone finds that it's good to call Baba Brenduša, dophrahia and Brancuși's servant.
Brinduša checks the child's breathing, then puts it under the horse ball, gathered from the front.
The strong-looking child.
The world's falling apart.
While the boy is allowed to spend more time with his beer, with joy, the party with the laurels continues with more strength.
The second day, the father and the son meet by the living room.
Radu Brancuis put Constantin to collect some news and bring them.
The father is like his son with his head down and, with the nuances of a boy, beats him to keep his mind.
And, while he feels the origin of the fighting, little Brancus has the revelation that the world can be seen and from a different perspective and that the things around it can appear dissuasive.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would have recognized the elderly, if no star himself was involved in his torture.
Would the sun be as bitter as his father for what happened to him?
At present, the city does not operate
A parliamentarian calls politicians to remind them of those who voted against them.
Independent member Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop internal wars and to redirect their agenda to the electorate.
What we now see on our political scene is a great disappointment and so much.
I haven't seen anything of the 2012 SSL projects that will continue.
Nor the highway, nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, just see how politicians debate their wide range of interests on the basis of real estate interests.
Let's get a little out of politics, get together and talk.
At present, the city is not working.
"If you're occupied with the internal war, you don't have time for those who have chosen you," Blajuz said.
He noted that the current political class has decomposed the outgoing electorate, resulting in a very low presence in the future local elections, around 30%, representing the party's faithful electoral practice.
The rapporteur also believes that the members will all be directed to traditional parties, expressing themselves to new political initiatives, as is the "Pentru Iași" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will do nothing but break out of the right electorate, not the PSD.
This kind of game is based on civil activity people, who are usually right.
"It's even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Blajuz.
He explained that he was not interested in a candidate at the future local elections, reducing his complaints about his intention to enroll in the course for Spring.
I said I don't want to apply for any local function.
I'm still wondering if you're going to continue as a member and in future mandate.
I tried to appeal to the unity for Iaşi and in the discussions on the floor with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make an image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people have voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," said Blajuç, who appreciated that the main reason why the elector is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the voters.
A member of the Father said he's not getting the money and he's got to go with the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
It's not a little money.
Sometimes I'm afraid to raise money from the castle.
At the end of the term of office, I will report on all I have spent outside the wages of the office employees and their maintenance.
It happened to rise in a month and 30,000, with all the transport, accommodation and others.
"To tell a parliamentarian that I'm not getting the money is pure hypocrisy," he concluded.
