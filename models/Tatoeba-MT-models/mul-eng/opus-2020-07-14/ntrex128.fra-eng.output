Members of the Galles National Assembly concerned about "passing for Marinenets"
Gallois elections are held by a proposal to replace their title with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Gallois Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Galileo Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be done by rail.
A working-list election indicated that his group was concerned about the fact that the bike “remains with Twp and Pwp”.
For non-original readers of the Wales Country: in gallois, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotch.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Part of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other forms.
The container part would be "open" to a name change, but it noted that between MWP and Muppet (marinette), the distance is hidden.
In this context, in Gallois, your letter is spoken as the letter or in English in the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the change in name, stated that "the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly will be the final one".
The Law 2007 on the Government of Wales Act of 2017 gives the Galloise Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Gallois Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission thinks in favour of Members of the Gallois Parliament (or the WMP); however, a large majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly make other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could have been a real case for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a draft law on the change of name in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during the discussions on the draft law.
Macedonia: reference to the amendment of the country's name
The Macedonians will decide tomorrow whether their country must now bear the name of the Republic of Macedonia.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a happy old-fashioned decade between the country and its Greek neighbor, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens insisted on the fact that Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its country to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, indicated that he would not take account of the results.
However, MPs, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change in name is not just a small price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, Saint Martin's bells reduced to silence
"The elderly people with whom I discussed said that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every street," says Adams.
"There is no more than today."
According to him, it is normal for the bars to be rediscovered.
Today, "we don't get used to the same way anymore, he explains.
“Before, we went to the bar like his neighbor, but this is no longer the case.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted before the responsible ones are represented, and that concerns them: “In a short time or later, they will return to the house.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help to keep the last sanctuarys in the neighborhood.
"People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be in a large part of the Whites who will predict the closure of the entire church, because it is unlikely that they will become members," he wondered.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, the white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial white-white Methodist congregation leaves places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which preached around, took possession of the building.
The Church of Saint Martin has been captured by a black community under the direction of River John Howard Johnson, who started a boycott of the 125th Street shops, one of the main commercial streets in Harlem, where the Blacks thought they were going to work or get promotion.
In 1939 a fire destroyed the building, but Father Johnson's Parisians were preparing to reopen and command a new carillion,
that the son and successor of Father Johnson to the church of Saint Martin, King David Johnson, called with a loud voice the "locks of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it another name: "a cultural treasurer" and "a historical instrument that is irreplaceable".
It also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin didn't replace him.
During the last few months, he was asked a lot of questions about the return of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the lay elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese of the other.
In July, the Parisian Council, a body of leadership composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that he was concerned that the latter wanted to impose the costs on him, even though he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some Parisians have been disappointed by the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old youth injured by a shark during a fishing party at home
According to the authorities, a rival attacked and injured a 13-year-old young man last Saturday while he was practicing fishing on the day of the opening of the season in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. in the morning near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel indicated to KSWB-TV, San Diego's TV channel, that he had spent half an hour with his friends in the morning when he heard the boy cry out for help and got paid to him to get out of the water.
In the first time, Chad thought that the young boy was going through a crisis of joy to have a take, then he realized that he really did.
He was dead.
Coming close to the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open section of the keyboard.
"I cry for everyone to come out of the water: There's a shark!" explains Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Children's Rady hospital in San Diego, where he is always in a critical state.
The species of the claim to the source of the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, Deputy Chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the chest.
The authorities closed access to the ponto Beach beach in Casablad up to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for safety reasons.
Giles indicates that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered harmless.
Sansbury's Offensive Plans in the British Aesthetic Market
Saninsbury's hands are low on Boats, Superdrug and Debenhams and the branches of raisons similar to those of supermarkets, along with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
Within the framework of a larger survey in the British aesthetic market of 2.8 billion styrling books, which continues to grow while fashion and home products sales are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is final.
Supermarkets are investing today in the beauty market in order to re-use the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sansbury indicated that it would increase the volume of its products to 3,000 cosmetic articles, which would be understood for the first time by such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of Boots.
The supermarket also relaxs its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of non-tested products on animals, which is increasingly important among young consumers.
In addition, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south of London, and a second that is scheduled for opening in the current year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to raise their head to attract consumers, which tends to increase their online purchases and guide them to shops nearby for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, Director-General of Sansbury's, said that sales points will be more like major surfaces, as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food products.
Saninsbury has placed Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also opened several Habitat stores since the purchase of two chains 2 years ago, which has, according to the group, allowed to promote sales of current consumer goods and to make purchases.
The previous attempts to restructure the ranges of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products from the British chain had been overcome by a failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury tried a partnership with Boots, but it ended up with a polymetic on the distribution of the benefits of the pharmaceuticals planted in supermarkets.
After selling it 3 years ago its 281 pharmaceuticals for a total of 125 million sterile books in Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, which was implemented by the new strategy.
Lloyds had to play a role there that was to introduce a wide range of brands for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director of Sansburys, announced that the appearance of beauty products has been changed to improve the customer's framework.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to respond to all kinds of needs and, thanks to the well-being of our regions and the ideal situation of our institutions, our governance of the cosmetics market is now inconsistency and changes the buying habits," said Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal of an agreement of 11 million £
E-mails from the TV program Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of an animator Holly Willoughby from a contract of 11 million £ related to his home decoration brand, to devote to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the interior decoration brand and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
At 37 years of age, this morning's animator announced on Instagram that she would be back.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, withdrawing from their fruitful textile and interior decoration in the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources reported that Jones was angry when the dear TV kid found out, at a meeting that was held under tension at the headquarters of the commercial empire of Dragon's Den in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, with a total of 1.5 million stereotypes, no longer allowed him to handle Truly, their decoration brand and internal accessories.
The Truly brand was similar to that of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she had left Truly, Jones sat in his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Great Britain.
According to a source, "Truly was far from one of Holly's priorities
and to ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left the whole world without a vote.
No one could imagine what would happen tomorrow, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is full of products ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the start of this morning's animator, who is among the most "bankable" Celebrates in Britain, could lose millions of people to society, due to significant investments in products leading from customs or customs, clothing or domestic goods, and the risk of delay.
In addition, this could lead to a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and his husband, Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples shared together on vacations and Peter Jones held 40% of the parties in Baldwin's television production society.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and take the place of Ant McPartlin as an animator of the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A close source from Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his commercial activities.
The debate was loud, but finally we loved it.
Trump was moved by the media that criticize him because of his comment that some judge "indignity of a president", and to show himself so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why has President Trump been so late?"
He ran it, taking a TV journalist's voice.
"I have nothing left of all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had shown favor of holding a second meeting, after Trump qualified for the first time, which took place in Singapore in June, not much to the North Korea decolonization.
However, negotiations relating to this decollarization are at the point of death.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, declared Saturday to the world leaders, at the United Nations General Assembly, no "responsible response" of the United States to the first disarmament measures of North Korea.
On the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his collection speech Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all going well with North Korea," said the North American president.
We fought the armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have a wonderful relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of his missiles, the release of hostages and the remnants of American soldiers to their families.
He also justified his little ordinary approach to relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of the president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-scale exercise, there's no more than 200 fronts in front of me," he criticised the right to the people.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that struck Lombok, the assistance of foreign NGOs was not necessarily necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, but no state of national disaster has been damaged, the conditions required for the withdrawal of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have many times clearly stated that they did not want international help, which makes things a bit complicated," laments Mrs. Summung.
While the Save the Children's organization has set up a team to return to Palu, it does not always know whether work on the ground will be allowed.
The national disaster management agency's spokesman, Mr Sutopo, indicated that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be authorized to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant consequences, the country lacks the means to bring itself to the opening of natural caprices.
Refugees have been moved to Aceh, but they are rare in other literary areas.
Although a warning has been delivered, no alarm siren has stayed in Palu, which has undoubtedly contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from an Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters make the use of transport more difficult.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to care for the victims is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the places of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed the reform of the infrastructure cut off at the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable sums to return the roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has led to Mr. Joko's government, called to represent the voters next year.
The head of the Indonesian state also suffers pressures related to the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives, and tens of thousands have been thrown out of their homes, based on confrontations in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.

Parliament: Cromwell's status, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the righteous return of things, in view of acts of destruction, of numerous religious and cultural goods in England, committed by its Puritan MPs, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society judges Mr Crick's proposal "reasonable" and has qualified it as a "revisionist attempt".
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said that, "Seeing the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's erection in front of the Westminster Palace should not be separated.
Cromwell has neither ordered nor led the iconoclasticism in English civil wars.
It is likely that he was sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas during the past century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell, sculptured by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the consideration we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said on Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defence of Parliament against external pressure, I would like to say of the monarchy.
Whether this representation is precise or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracturing.
Its achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and remembered."
China: a cook kills a lifter
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a cook in a market in southern China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the cut and covered art near a market corner in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, indicated the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder is ready to inject pigs into a piggy, on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday, in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door of the neighbor's porridge was open.
He claims that a huge male porcupine was found inside and that blood was boiling out of his throat.
A medical report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the lift to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the driver of the elevator, said that his legs were broken and covered with blood.
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 04h40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the beginning of Mr. Yuan's death did not belong either to the lifter or to his cousin.
A market official entrusted the Evening News with the animal to prevent any other incident and to enable police to collect evidence.
Mr Yuan's family and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, assaults against people have already been reported.
In 2016 in a Massachusetts farm, a pig attacks a woman and her husband, seriously damaging this last one.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kg pig had a gallon height on its tractor before his wife had managed to distance him from him.
In 2012, when a leader from Oregon came to be destroyed by his cocoons, a farmer from Manitoba claimed to CBC News that he was not actually an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood could cause this kind of behavior.
"These are rather animals players,
They have no intention of doing evil.
It is enough to show them the respect they deserve," he said.
Ouragan Rosa's remains should cause strong precipitation in the south-eastern United States
According to the estimates, Ouragan Rosa weakens as it moves above the coldest waters of the north-east coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will be responsible for violations in the north-east of Mexico and the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
The winds fell at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) from 5 a.m. in the morning, the East hour on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane should move to the North on Sunday.
During this time, depression begins to rise above the Pacific Ocean and circle to the west coast of the United States. As the moon approaches the Basse-California Peninsula in the form of storm, the hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approximate depression will create generalised torrential rains in the south-west in the coming days.
At the local level, projections ranging from 2,5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous Sudanese crossings, debriefings and potential landslides in the desert.
The averages will reach a speed of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per hour, including in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in the south-west regions, including a large part of Arizona.
Dissemination tropical rains are likely to cause sudden floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical precipitation.
Intensified rainwaters could turn canyons into depleted rivers and canals produce wind and dust bubbles from places.
The approaching depression will lead to abundant local rain in some southern regions of the country, on the California Littoral.
All fluiometrics can reach more than 1,3 cm, which could cause weak debrasings and make smoothing.
It could be the first rain of the dry season in the region.
Tropical divergences will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, and will then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Strong precipitations will take place around the four corners of the Mardi country and will last until Wednesday.
Important changes in temperature are to be planned for the month of October through the United States due to Arctic freezing, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time on short distances.
A perfect example is the central region of the United States, which rises on Sunday from considerable temperatures.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to filter and re-intention.
A large part of the centre and east of the United States should be identified at the beginning of October, with temperatures around 26 degrees Fahrenheit [26 ° C] and other north-east regions.
The mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
The forecasts for several days indicate that temperatures should be above average in the United States in the east during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 Thursday television channels, heard hearings by Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s, was followed by more than 20 million people.
As the political momentum declines, distribution services have interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a series of theatres: an agreement designed by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct a week's investigation on charges.
In front of the Senate Court, Christine Ford made sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had been subjected to assaults on his person and had tried to remove his clothes during an evening between the students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate withdrawal, also claimed to be certain to 100 % that this had never happened.
According to a report by Nielsen, the trial has certainly reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC Televisors.
The figures of other channels that broadcast the process, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Furthermore, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching television at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, which was widely supported by the animations of Kavanaugh, was the most screened on the day of the hearing, with an average of 5.69 million TV viewers.
ABC took the second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), remained after Nielsen.
The interest did not fail once the hearing was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a communication to which it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras released a scene in which the senator was part of the panel while he tried to take the elevator to the hearing of the judicial committee.
Flake lowers his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of direct interpletion.
"Don't look anymore, look at me," one of the women leaves.
"Do you really believe that he is telling the truth ?
You hold power while so many women are demonized."
Before reference was made to the elevator doors, Fleke indicated that his office had published a statement and that he would speak more about it at the Commission meeting.
All cabled and broadcast network channels would cover the meeting directly within a few hours later, while the judicial committee was preparing to vote in order to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh throughout the Senate.
Flake pointed out, however, that a week's investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on charges against the candidate, which claimed minority democracies.
Flake left part of the debate with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after having been interviewed with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
His choice was heavy in balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate allegations of sexual assaults by Brett Kavanaugh.
Great Britain: May accuses the opponents in Brexit of making the "small political"
In an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the dictators of his project to leave the European Union, to make the "small political" in the future of Britain and national interest.
May came to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in coverage, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on Chequers' plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "very ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: the police stop Dyteon Simpson, supposed to be at the beginning of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect of the fatal shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was convicted of murder at the second grade, reported the Baton Rouge police service.
The authorities published a video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that Sims had lost his moons during the shift.
Found on crime sites, the moons carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, CBS's branch.
In his interrogation, Simpson appealed to the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his case was set at $350,000.
The Baron-Rouge parish doctor's office published a preliminary report on Friday, which states that death was caused by a bullet that passed through the head and settled in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the state police medical-legal laboratory, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked the authorities for their "committed and asked for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, it marked 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rebounds per match during the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach declared that the team was "damaged and under the shock" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We're going to waste this kind of event all the time," Wade regrets.
Mexico: A Cracked Volcano
From the fall from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended that the Mexicans stay away from the volcano, after having recorded some activity in the crater, with 183 gas and greenhouse emissions at 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several stems and shocks coming from Popocatepetl.
On the social networks, images would show fine cuts covering cars' father-in-laws in Mexico City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have observed an increase in the activity at the volcano level of 72 km from the capital, since a earthquake of 7.1 magnitude strikes the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalogue: conflicts between police and separatists near the anniversary of the vote for independence
Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after encounters between independent protesters and the anti-meditated police, while thousands of opposers joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided the Catalan.
Before being rejected by anti-emeducated police, masked separatists threw them out of eggs and colored dust, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not spread to tourists.
Exhausted officers also released later in the day, while the police used matraques to contain the attacks.
For several hours, groups in favour of the independence that had "not forgotten or forgiven" had faced the Union's partners calling "long life in Spain".
14 demonstrators presenting minor injuries were treated according to local press.
One year after the October 1 referendum, judged illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain in the independent region.
An increasing majority of electors have chosen independence, despite a low rate of participation, the opposition to the secession which has largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the Catalans from accessing the voting offices in the region.
Independent groups had campaigned on Friday night to block a demonstration of support to the national police.
It was the same place, but it was difficult to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, an 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope of the independence of the Catholic Church.
"We have been witnesses last year for a great time.
My parents were happy to have the idea of voting, but now we are in a hurry," he laments.
Despite their capital victory, however, in the last December regional elections, the independent Catalan parties had the wrong to maintain this year, many popular leaders were dispossessed or detained while waiting to be tried to organize the referendum and declare the independence of the Catalan people.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who films the police support on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand, and on the other.
"The tension only makes it mount," he regretted.
Sadie, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison in the waiting for a trial since last year, announced his intention to present his application to the European Parliament's elections next year.
"This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men beat a car house

Livingston wins the match 1 to 0 against the Ranges through Menga
Dolly Menga's First Goal ensures Livingston's Victory
Recently, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 matches at Steven Gerrard, the current trainer of the Ibrox Club.
Menga's goal was to make the difference and allow Gary Holt's team to place itself in the second position of the classification, equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are free to win outside Premiership this season, and they have to face the Hearts team tomorrow, which runs 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet Vienna's Rapid on the occasion of the European League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it extends from 6 matches its invasive course in the division, and its main trainer Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can hesitate not to lose the least meeting yet.
Livingston has missed an opportunity to face up to those who oppose him.
The Holt team would have been able to move forward well before marking, as their direct approach made the Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson tried to escape but remained focused on the opposite goal; he followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head step by Craig Halkett.
Livingston's team let the Rangers own the balloon, knowing that it could generate them through working tactics.
That's where the decisive goal comes in.
The Rangers gave a franchise and Livingston tried to open it; Declan Gallagher and Robinson agreed to join Menga, which takes a touch and has an objective in the field environment.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but faced an impenetrable defense and Liam Kelly's goal guard was not only worrying.
The second half knew the same rhythm, although Alfredo Morelos had forced Kelly's arrest.
The Rangers' Guardian Allan McGregor arrested Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to slow down one of Livingston's plans.
Livingston's guard will rest all his attempts and protect his case, while two penalists have been rejected by the Arbitrary, one for the prosecution of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a lack of hands.
Livingston’s Phenomene - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland, to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and performance for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed the expectations of this climber.
Their style and composition of the team have not changed in practice since their return to the summit, but the merit comes largely to Holt to have since its arrival motivated a team
Who cares about a lot of great players.
The defense of Captain Halket was great and magnificently organized, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the hall throughout the course of the match.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level with Gerarrd, they have not been at the height of their past talent.
They missed a last chance and were able to cross the opposite side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, which is found in the middle of the table.
Adopted by President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29th, Turkish and German leaders met around a small Sunday in Berlin in an atmosphere that held them.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or even Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then called for Cologne for the introduction of one of the largest mussels.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from meeting in front of the building, while many MPs were able to approach their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to his country.
The clivage that emerges from protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed in heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist falls after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist is lost in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred about 10 a.m., near the connection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent route from Deptford to the south-east of the city.
The vehicle driver stopped, the rescues arrived on the spot, but the man was lost on the scene.
The accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday. The car driver took off.
The London Police stated that the officers were doing their best to identify the person and prevent his/her neighbors.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been put in place. It is advised car drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lattin Prison: 6 agents injured in an eviction
The prison officer for high-security men reported that six prison officers had been injured at a hearing.
The event began in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, at 09:30 a.m. this Sunday. It is not always under control.
Specialized anti-emergency officers were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison cell.
In place, the agents were treated for minor injuries in the face.
A spokesman for the prison management said: "The staff specially trained has been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six agents were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. The officials will have to answer the police authorities and will be able to see their punishments extended."
More than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country, are imprisoned in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-emergence agents were sent to prison to call for a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked their personnel with billard bombs.
Ouragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by subsidized crossings (which could be beneficial for areas affected by drought)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but that is certainly what will happen at the beginning of the next week. The Rosa eargan is heading towards the south-west desert with what remains of its energy. This region could be affected by subtitious crossings.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued alerts for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should direct herself on Phoenix Tuesday, with rain announcers from Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service based in Phoenix stated in a tweet that “only ten tropical cycles have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
The Ouragan Katrina (1967) was stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurcane Center include 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the south-west desert, including the central area of the Rocheuses and the Grand Bassin, should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures of up to 10 cm.
The rainwaters of Rosa could be lifesaving for areas affected by drought that are not exposed to the risks of immediately crossing.
Even if the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial to the south-west region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, some 40 per cent of Arizona knew at least one extreme drought, the second most serious category," reports weather.com.
The Ouragan Rosa starts its way on the coast, in the pool of Basse-California.
Every day of a great power tomorrow and a generation of winds that can reach 135 km/h, Rosa was located at 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at the speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the coast of Mexico with the force of a hurricane Monday or Monday night.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation may be massive and risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from the Basse-California in the north-west of Sonora and will reach 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and the south of Utah in the evening of March.
"Torrent floods are expected in Basse-California, north-west of Sonora and in the south-west desert and constitute the main threat," explained the National Hurricane Center.
These precipitations are believed to be given place to potentially deadly subsidised crusts and debriles in the arid areas, as well as to land leaks in mountain areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the murder attempt, after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday at 4 a.m. in the morning.
He was sent to the hospital. His state is currently stable.
The police of Avon and Sommerset indicated that four young people (ages 17, 18 and 20 years old) were arrested on the night of Radstock's side.
The agents launched a call to people who might have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been the victim of the evil and anger of the Democrats.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the imputable and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a meeting in Wheeling in Virginia-Occidental.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had been victims of the abuse and anger of the Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke yesterday in front of the Congress, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's allegations with energy and emotion, who accused her of having sexually abused her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing.
The president stated on Saturday that "the American people were witnesses to the intelligence and courage of Kavanaugh" this day.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of participants gathered in Virginia-Occidental.
The President made an indirect reference to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he pointed out the importance of the participation of republicans in the mid-term elections.
"We are at five weeks of one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I beat myself on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on the mission of "resistance and obscenity".
The first motion for a decision to the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place on Friday following the statement by a Republican Party's co-rapporteur to CNN.
Indonesia: a seismic and tsunami cause hundreds of victims, the battle does not stop
On Saturday, the authorities said that at least 384 people had died, most of whom had been carried away by huge vagues that had fallen on the beaches while a earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
Friday, hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when six-metre-high waves submerged the beach at night. They carried many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, of a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the threat of tsunami arose yesterday, the whole world was still on the beach. People didn't go immediately, this cost their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't arrive alone. It caused cars, wood trucks, dwellings, it carried everything with it," explained Nugroho, explaining that the tsunami had moved in full sea at the speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by screaming at trees, add it.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed furniture and shops, deformed and encroulated bridges, as well as a pool surrounded by water.
The Replica continued to excavate the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes have been felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the earthquake of Friday was 200 times higher than the power of the last atomic bomb on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have broadened the size of the tsunami, it explained.
According to Nugroho, the costs are considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels have been destroyed.
Corps were found trapped under the ruins of destroyed buildings, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that human and material losses could be more important than 300 km north of Palu, a region called Donghea, the nearest epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications have been “completely paralysed” since Donghea, declared Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Red in a communiqué, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although agents had declared that the waves had arrived at the time the alert was published.
A amateur video shared on social networks shows a man at the foot of a frenetic building to passers in the street than a tsunami nears.
A few minutes later, a water wall fell on the coast, bringing with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power panel that cut off all communications in Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to provide assistance by aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport ran through rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia: Tsunami victims' balance has risen, more than 800 deaths have been reported.
It's a tragedy.
The members of the World Vision staff of Donghea arrived healthy and safe in Palu, where they found refuge in the abris-battles located in the court of their offices. On the way, they discovered the destruction scenes, explains Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he explained.
It's a tragedy.
When the relief groups began to help the syllables, some complained that very experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funds, salaries and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is always considered regional," explains Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says it is a national disaster, international assistance can take place, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, the neighbors of the missing people would still have a miracle.
Sadie, a little boy was found in the caves.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman taught under the roof for two days, near her mother's body.
The trainer of the Indonesian national parapet team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the athletes lost for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students found themselves in the Roa Roa Roa hotel, added Mr. Mandiya.
"As an elder in the discipline of the speaker, I have performed my own dramas," he explained.
In the hours following the announcement of the funeral of the Roa Roa Roa hotel in the parapet community, Mr. Gedon reported that he had unexpectedly sent messages to the athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages remained unresponsible.
"I think they've never received my messages."
At Newport on the Levee, volleyballs subtilize $26,750 when recharged by an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, volunteers spent $26,750 on a Brink's agent who was recharged by an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, after a press release from Newport police service.
The vehicle driver lived a distributor in the fun complex and prepared to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspicions about leaving places, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All persons with information on their identity are requested to contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Yes
The rapper Kanye West is now calling you.
To announce the new on Saturday Twitter, he wrote: "I used to know the name of Kanye West."
41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for a while, used this nickname as title for his eighth album, since June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
Its participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his arrival for "emotional reasons", explained the author of the emission.
In addition to being the abbreviation of its current professional pseudonym, it also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think "Yes" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you", explained West earlier this year, citing the title of his album with his Big Boy guest.
“ So I am you, and I am yours.
I've been from Kanye, who means "the only" to Ye-he reflects the good, the evil, the confusion, all of it.
This album, it's a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West in the past, also played on the union trade and the majuscules.
In Mexico, AMLO says he will never resort to military force against civilians.
The Mexican president elected Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military force against civilians, almost fifty years after the bloody repression of the student forces.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco's place that "never use the military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the groups opened fire during a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people when student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting the young Mexican by providing monthly grants to students and by opening up more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities force young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for research in this sector, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors have made announcements about IA, while an IA strategy is missing from the United States.
In parallel, China presented its last year's road map: it plans to become the IA innovation leader by 2030.
“Doubling the research funds in the IA area would be a good start, because all other countries have a long lead on the United States, and we are looking for the next great discovery in IA,” explains Lee.
To double the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of IA comes from the United States, Lee told CBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the PDG of Synoving Ventures, who invested in one of China's most important IA companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that defeated the best-class American Othello player. He then joined Microsoft Reasearch's lead team and became the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
She has already participated in technological competitions organized by the American Government, such as the Defense Defense Challenge Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked where the next competition would take place to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain government funding.
"It's not China that suits university leaders, it's companies," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large university names to work on IA.
She added that changes in immigration policies could also support the efforts of the United States in relation to IA.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to researchers in IA," he said.
The Council of State of China launched its development plan for the new generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," explained Lee.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defence of the United States has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should involve industry and academic partners. The House-Blanche has announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million per year for IA research.
At the same time, American legislation to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any measures for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on behalf of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians heard their vote at a referendum on the change in the name of their country to the Republic of Macedonia, which would resolve an old difference for several decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a right on its territory and opposed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two Governments signed an agreement based on the new name proposed, but the opposition nationalist claimed that the change would affect the ethical identity of the Macedonian slave population, the majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote at the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50 % participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for accession to NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the parties to the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, it is worth paying to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which are spared from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of my country, for Macedonia's youth, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it a decision.
The change in the name would require a majority of the two thirds in Parliament.
The Electoral Commission of State announced that no irregularities had been detected at 13 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, while it reached 34 per cent at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66 per cent of the voters enrolled after the election.
"I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the referendum and voted for a change of name in order to open the vote on accession to NATO and the European Union, Struca, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, the Parliament is preparing a small scene and has seats in front of the tents installed by those who are boycotting the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and the NATO, but we want to enter the big door," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in the European integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO's accession will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
"I think a large majority will be favourable, as more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr Zaev after depositing his bulletin.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters wanted to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian chain Telma, estimated 57 per cent participation.
70% of the voting participants said they would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50% of the votes will need a more vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first time that the Government's policy of the West has been in force since it took power in May last year.
Action decisive: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, takes a path through the Bridgeton Defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Defence Forces of Brighton in Manchester and won the 2-0 Saturday match at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The goal of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action of the world for the player.
The Argentine Butter received the balloon in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenders, before he jumped on the ground.
Aguero was then tried by four green mails.
He was surrounded by a defender before he woke up near the target of Brighton.
Then he passed the balloon to Sterling, on his left.
The English front took advantage of sending the balloon back to Aguero, who used his right foot to trap Brighton's guard, Matthew Ryan, with a cut from the right side of the file.
"Aguero had some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiana, team coach, to journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the chance he marked at this time."
But it's Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial advantage during the first League match,
by the 29th minute.
Aguero received the balloon directly on Brighton's territory.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few hits before going to Sterling's second floor.
The Skyblues front sent the balloon into the files just before moving out of the ground.
The city will meet Hoffenheim in the Campions League group at 12:55 a.m. on the Rhine-Neckar-Arena of Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherer wants to play the game trolleys against Rockies
The National Team was removed from the course to playoff, there was no reason to start in a new match.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of decisive match for the Rockies, real legends facing the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies brought him 5-2 face to the Nationals Friday night, but they're always looking to secure their first division title.
"Even though this match is not an accident, we want to bury the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level that I would have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launch tomorrow, but they would be willing to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would start the 34th, will be in Thursday training and will launch on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington Right is 18-7 with an average score of 2,53 and 300 discounts on 220 brands and two thirds of this season.
Trump's interventions in Virginia-Occidental
The President drew attention to the situation that had generated his support in Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by discussing the importance of the participation of republicans in the mid-term elections.
“ All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are at five weeks of one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I'm fighting all the fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this horrible radical group, really horrible, Democrats, you see it in action.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They depend on who they hurt, who they shout to take power and control. That is what they want, power and control, and we are not going to give them."
Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obscenity".
"You can find it in the last four days," he added, before he qualified the democracies of people "in anger, ridicule and lies."
He called on the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee and the Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein, who deserved to be elected by the public.
“Do you remember his answer? ”
Did you open the document?
Yes, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When the activists of the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, that was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians of the Labour Party considered to be not welcome, all because we have expressed our ideas.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received identical treatment because she was raised against anti-Semitism.
As for me, I was censored because I was in disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Unfortunately, these are the subjects for which Jeremy himself was in disagreement with the leaders.
The Nottingham East Laborour meeting announced: "We want the collection to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the General Assemblys of Friday evening were during my eight years as a parliamentary member of the Labour Party.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today for many collections and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has been forgotten long ago, if it has never been taken into account.
It has become clear that the opposite opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its admissibility by the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy's power was taken away, and the colleagues with whom I thought to share a political vision began to expect me to return my clothes and take positions against my convictions, whether it concerns national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abuse of social networks, calling for withdrawal, disclosing central policies, saying that I should not be a member of the party.
And that's not just my experience.
In addition, I have more chance than some of my colleagues, because the comments I received were political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a dissident of existing or racist issues every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most important things in current policy is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is restricted to the rule of defence and change of electoral rules.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years: lowering my eyes, not expressing my ideas so strong, and everything would be fine.
But this is not to do as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as an educator, because the lack of the Government of Thatcher caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and my differences with the current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who have defended the movement on Friday is that the country goes to a Brexit that will affect the parties, businesses and public services, and I think this is not really the time to lose time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the party's leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunity will prevent me from acting for the reasons I defend, which are your interests to all.

Age 38 - 17 Melrose : Other Invasive
Two recent trials may have failed the final result, but no doubt above: Ayr would have spent this triumph next to the intense match of the Spring Olympic Championship to XV.
The team now handles the top of the class and becomes the only invasive team of the champion.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they have taken the opportunity to open the score. The coach Peter Murchie can be pleased with this match.
"To this day, we have been tested. But we remain uninvasive, then I must be happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: "Bravo to them, they have been more effective than we have had opportunities."
Grant Anderson's test, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for the exotic escape of Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors match, allowed Melrose to talk about the figures. Jason Baggot was exposed to an untransformed test.
Climo made the situation worse for Ayr with a criminality, first, just in the mid-term. He marked and transformed a solo test to mount the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose well began the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
A long waiting followed because of a serious wound by Ruaridh Knott, who left the land on a town. During the retiring, Ayr resumed the proceedings with a test by Stafford McDowell transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, captain at the end of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an untransformed test from Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to have hit Climo while he had no balloon, since the touch of penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's mouth, which was moving forward.
Climo transformed the test, like almost every time since the rehearsal, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's kick box and sent Uncle Gregor Henry away for the fifth test of the team at home.
The star of Still Game starts in the restoration
Ford Kieran, Still Game's star, decided to take a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a restaurant company under license.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he wrote and joined with his long-term partner on stage, Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the ninth series will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiggang.
According to the official records, he is the Director of Affymorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a Scottish Sun source revealed that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "flowering environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is with us": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will turn its way to the Pacific
Seas are patrolled in a boat covered in the General Naval La Paz.
Public buildings build a blue layer like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazonia, the ship's bases show the following engine: "The sea returns right.
Recovery is a duty.’
Through the whole of Bolivia blocked, the memory of a coast lost to the benefit of Chile in a conflict of resources dating back to the 19th century is still very present. All like the wish to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once more.
This hope has not been so palpable for several decades. Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be held on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and seriousness, and looks forward to a positive outcome," explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will proceed with the Bolivian application. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile should negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the Bolivian Ocean.
Evo Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia (which is facing a controversial struggle for reelection next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made Monday.
"We are almost able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that there are few chances that the court is in favour of Chile, and that few things would change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations Authority based on the Netherlands was unable to grant a Chilean territory, and provided that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case was "not complicated", explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may even have been damaged in the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been reduced by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The Belgian rhetoric of Morales knew all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of Ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who represents Bolivia to the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to start a new age of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end up to 139 years of disputes with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - which remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political bacillus.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must avoid the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can rely on the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, stated that his country would not rely on its nuclear weapons until he was trusted in Washington.
It was expressed on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He expressed himself at the time when US Secretary Mike Pompeo appeared on the point of relaunching a nuclear diplomacy over three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong Un, currently head of North Korea.
It states that it is "chemical" to think that the maintenance of the sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that will bring an end to the war in Korea will cause the North to rise.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of significant advance disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, Pyongyang's seriousness of rebuffing an Arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is the debate.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.

If you want to add XXL pieces to your hair collection or protect you from sun by 100%, do not try again.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne have presented their collection of colorful top hats at a PE19 profile that has earned respect for the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
All the more extraordinary hats that others have invaded Instagram this state, and the creators have decided to integrate their delicate parts into the gaps.
Valentino's front room was an extraterrestrial beige hat decorated with a large board of wool, which covered the head of mannequins.
The other superior accessories included paired shoes of bees, a hat and even a pineapple. But these parts have not been imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had the hair cuts and were higher than Hannibal Lecter than the High-Couture.
One creation resembled a plong equipment, with tuba and moonnets, while another was thinking about a deep ice queen.
And if you follow the trends of fashion, then you have the chance.
According to style observers, chaplain taxors could come up to your trading routes.
.The XXL hats follow the sign of the "Bomba", the wide-beam hat that the stars draw, from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The cult brand that commercializes this difficult portable hat that has launched social networks has presented another of its creations on the podium: a piece of clay, almost as large as the mannequin in a bathroom that carried it.
The hot orange fan bag, decorated with rafias and a white leather belt, was the master part of the PE19 Jacquemus River during the Paris Fashion Week.

John Edward: Language skills are essential to citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a school excellence record. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent review results enhanced by a collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as citizens of the world.
As the education sector is able to design and implement a school-based program, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart. ”
This reminds us that we cannot support English to create relations and build a trust link with the inhabitants of other countries.
In view of the excellent results of this year's reviews, it is noted that languages are higher than classification, with the highest levels of success in independent schools.
Overall, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
Data collected at 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest score, A in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied Germany, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Currently, languages as materials are organized all like science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programmes of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 reveals that among the difficulties faced by employers in recruiting candidates, 17% are linked to insufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more employment offers that require languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of your choice of career, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future through this sustainable competence.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of their competitors.
According to a 2013 survey of 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% did not master a foreign language enough to have a conversation.
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking in several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a decent job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach important languages for the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
The independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of their future.
It is clear that, at the present time, in a global commercial environment, languages remain of capital importance for the country’s future. This must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered as “International Communication Skills”.
Independent schools will continue to propose this choice, diversity and excellence to the Scottish youth.
You have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with the Lakers Saturday in San Diego.
The alert is almost over for fans who are looking for the beginnings of LeBron James in the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, the coach of the Lakers, announced that James would play Sunday, opening the pre-season against the Dungets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell doubted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the training, earlier this week, James was asked for his projects for the pre-session program, which includes six matches.
"At this stage of my career, I do not need pre-sason match to be ready."
Campsite de Trump en Virginia-Occidental (Chaneyen YouTube)
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, Virginia-Occidental.
Other steps, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
The vote to confirm the vacancy to the Supreme Court is reported, Trump seeks to collect support for the upcoming mid-command elections and to avoid that the Republicans lose control of the Congress in November.
What time did Trump's meeting in Virginia-Occidental take place this evening and how to look at it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, Virginia-Occidental, is scheduled for 19 a.m. (East hour) on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, directly on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the hearings of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be reported up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims first to help the Republicans win the country for November elections.
According to Reuters, the president of North America stated in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at "encouraging the volunteers and supporters while the Republicans tried to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and in the Chamber of Representatives".
"The control of the Congress is such an essential element of its programme that the President will make in the largest number of States possible at the beginning of this electoral campaign," said Reuters a spokesman from the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, this evening's meeting, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, could be held by "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh media".
Saturday, this will be the second visit in a month from Trump in Virginia-Occidental, a State that won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate at the Virginia-Occidental Senate, who is on the train in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to relaunch him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team is ready to fight to keep waiting near Sunday's simples
After three simple days, Saturday afternoon supplies could well represent what was missing in this Ryder Cup.
The elan balance movement is a sportive concept invented by all parts but that players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments like that.
So where would they be at now?
"They lived with six points ahead and now four, so that gives us a bit of wings," said Jordan Spieth while he returned for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little bit of the wind in their lungs and have all the reasons to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played all day and can have managed to get every three points on four.
Spieth showed himself terribly effective from tea to green and gave the example.
The energy joy crises intensified as his game progressed. A crucial hole enabled him to balance the fourth part while Thomas and he was led down two after two holes.
His ass, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th floor, caused a similar crisis, of those who tell you that he still believed in the American team.
“ It really needs to be determined and focus on its game, ” said Spieth.
That's all that's left for each of these players right now.
18 trolls to move.
The only players to have marked more than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the history of Ryder Cup testifies to.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four matches and has no right to the wrong.
Not only were "Moliwood" alone not to realize a bogey Saturday after noon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine Friday mornings.
This series, the way their energy seems to go around between them and the crowd in deliberating them as players to fight tomorrow, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who captures a potential European winner when the sun falls on the National Golf.
At the same time, the two of them are different.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly fought Sergio Garcia, a morning's hero, while he was teaming with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine times sent the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never recall.
On the contrary, no one's here to help you.
The forums and the forums are so fascinating to observe because of the interaction between the peers, the advice they give and those they do not give, and how a strategy can be based on an eye clinic.
Europe has played a better role in the team so far and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this forum also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some questioned, particularly in the country.
Europe runs 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after having won 10-6 on the United States in the mornings and Saturdays.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari carried the load with two winners on a Tiger Woods in distress, which allowed them to mark four points until now.
Determined to maintain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning's holidays against an American team.
The United States has shown greater resistance in the forums and has won two victories, but they have failed to rescind the gap.
Jim Furyk's men have to improvise eight points on 12 Sundays when simple to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to draw four points of affile, while Molinari and him, named after a weak weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup history to get four points at their first four matches.
After breaking up Woods and Patrick Reed in the suburbs, they battled across the coast the pair composed of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already made up of 5 and 4 more categories.
Woods, who had been trained during the two Saturdays, woke up a few times, but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in furballs and forzoms, and seven in affiles.
Justin Rose, well equipped for breakfast in the morning, made a team with Henrik Stanson in the forums, winning the victory 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world class.
Europe was not separated during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, under a time of free-of-charge.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the reference to the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well deserved 2-1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the suburbs and have another battle with Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the suburbs, who lost the first two towers.
Two times in the history of Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a difference of four points in simple, although Furyk's team, who had the crown, had no more than a zero match to preserve its trophies.
After having been second for two days, however, they may not return from a day-to-day attack.
North Korea states that disarmament will not be possible in “no case” alone without confidence.
Sadie, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions would strengthen its impunity for the United States and that it would be impossible for her country to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally in these circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that the North Korea had taken the last year of "important measures of good will", such as ending such as nuclear and missile testing, nuclear testing site maintenance and its commitment not to spread weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States," he regretted
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While reiterating the well-known claims of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a “by-step” approach to the declaration under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took progressive measures, its statement was important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral decolonization as Pyongyang had done it in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore during the first summit between an American executive president and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed himself to working for a "declaration of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States stated that Pyongyang should first withdraw from its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to supplement severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea proceed first to decollarization and accentuate the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even against the "declaration of the end of war".
“Those who think these sanctions can cause us to cry don’t know us.
The problem is that the maintenance of sanctions increases our disability."
No comment was made on the second summit between Kim and Trump in force to the United Nations by the United States leaders earlier this week.
Rather, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, and added: "If the part concerned by the issue of decolonization was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean penalization would not be in such a state."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of the last year, when he declared before the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was impossible to put North-Korean missiles on the North American territory after President Trump qualified Kim of "missile man" in a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the last year before the United Nations to “completely destroy” North Korea, did not have a lot of credit this year on the courage that Kim had applied for disarmament, but added that he still had much to do and that the sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea would not be disarmed.
Wednesday, Trump said that no deadline had been set. "It can take two years, three or five months; it has no significance," he said.
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must be firmly and systematically maintained until the total, final and verifiable declaration."
The Security Council has strengthened unanimously sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to enhance the financing of the nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri at the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already made three times in North Korea, but his last trip was a little rather disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made but, in the hours following, North Korea had declared its “gangster methods”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to launching a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean President, Kim claims security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard: students take rest courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all students of the first cycle to sleep better and fight against the growing machinist tendency that is to study in the use of caffeine all night.
A teacher noted that most students of the best universities in the world do not know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sommeil at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first class in the United States.
After giving a conference on the effects of sommeil privatization on learning that the idea has come to him
Finally, a student approached me and said, "Why did you just tell me this last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of the dream, which surprised me," she confided in The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits in order to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director-General of University Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding out that the students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee, rice, basketball, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of the lack of sommeille on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before cooking.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack, AVC, depression and cancer.
A map of the field containing interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not automatically change students' behavior.
However, we think they have the right to know this information - the same way you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of the pride of "passing a night white" still exists, and it adds that modern technology and constant pressure on students make a growing problem of the lack of sleep.
The fact that there is a sufficient and high-quality shade should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, stress and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight loss, because the lack of sommeil puts the brain in an ininitiation mode, making them tired permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year in Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and had forced him to insist that he was proposed to all the camps.
It is hoped that the next step will be to propose to all students in the third cycle to follow a similar study programme before joining the institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students prepare for both the time of the evening and for the day of the day, and be aware of the adverse effects of the "white light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circular pace and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to break Gerrard's men
The Rangers went up a new hard cut out, Dolly Menga's attack led by the disarmed team of Steven Gerrard in Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
The team of Ibrox hoped to record its first victory from its triumph 4--1 in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team influenced Gerard's second defeat in 18 matches as an trainer, leaving his team behind eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the mid-terms and the Rangers team, in short inspiration, failed to balance.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston takes his third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the Calum Spence Arbitr who had to be cared for for for for a wound to the head after an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which hosted Ayr in the middle of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, as far as he was concerned, chose the same Livi 11 that drew a point to the Hearts last week and would have been encouraged to see that his well-trained team was exaggerating its opponents in every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the balloon, but Livingston did more.
They had to mark two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the ground environment left his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then pulled a powerful blow towards Captain Craig Halket, but his co-definer Alan Lithgow could only reach the second floor.
The Rangers managed to take control, but it seemed that there was more hope than faith in their game in the last three.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have received a penalty after the French strike when Steven Lawless and his wife were in college, but Arbitr Steven Thomson separated from Colombia's demands.
The Rangers enjoyed only two shots in the first period, but the former guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was in pain troubled by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria trap.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute is against the game course, nothing can deny that they merit it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to meet Jacobs' arrested leg.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the balloon to Scott Robinson, who kept his blood-fried to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard responded at mid-term by replacing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent and the exchange failed to have an immediate impact when the alias was presented in front of Morelos, but the impressionant Kelly planned to block.
Livingston has yet to urge visitors to play exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long balls on long balls.
Holt's team would have been able to take advantage of the last moments, but McGregor was well-deployed to replace Jacobs before Lithgow left the target.
Replacer of the Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was taking Jacobs, but Thomson has again ignored him.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Computer
And now, a page from our Germanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COMPETUR TOURNE... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that was subsequently born to the device known as Geiger's computer.
Since then, Geiger's accountant has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950's "Bels of Coronado" film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man says, "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger computer, we use it to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, we can actually hear the effects of atoms released in the minerals by radioactivity."
Evans said, "So, of course it's safe here!"
“ Hans ” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that bears its name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "discover" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "discover" cancer cells and kill them.
In the course of treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognise cancer cells
This technique is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory.
Then they can "discover" a protein that is common to many cancers, and then they are re-injected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose aim is to learn the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Institute for Cancer based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein causes an increase in several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immunosuppressive cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, gave evidence in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Coifef of a MAGA cache, Kanye West launched in a Pro-Trump diaribe after his passage to SNL.
It didn't happen well.
Kanye West went down on the platform after a successful performance during which he hosted American President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would be presenting the elections in 2020.
After his third horse, Ghost Town, he sings by wearing a jacket Make America Great Again, West took them to the Democrats and returned his support to Trump.
"Well, sometimes I talk to whites and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism was my concern, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL issue was launched by Matt Damon's sketch, in which the Hollywood video was moved by Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Court of Justice on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been published, the registration of the West Diary has been linked to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to move from West with this publication.
In addition, West was complaining to the public that he had spent a bad four-hour time in the coulsettes because of his casket.
“ They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with this helmet on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And after they say I'm in a golf course," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the guffre?" and says he would wear his superman hat, because no one can tell him his actions. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted him to birds at least twice from the public and the members of the SNL seemed to be embarrassed, reports Variety. One on-site person said in the magazine, "A silence of death fell on the whole of the board."
West had been called to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has disappointed many people by singing the song I Love it in a costume of Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "In one of the most courageous souls: MERCI D'AVOIR TINU TÉTE TO THE FOULE."
But Karen Hunter, the founder of the show, doubted that West was just "faithful to himself, and that it is absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music, his clothes or by supporting his art) who, I think, adopts and defeats an evil ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before the issue, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known under the name of Kanye West".
He is not the first to change his name and follows Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg rapper brought the name Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fireman, who changed his name in symbol, then the artist was previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the game of Thrones series, takes it to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his final role in the game of Thrones, the violent HBO media series.
But the 31-year-old actor took the stereotype of the macho hero, asserting that this type of role on the screen often makes young boys go through it to make it difficult to cook.
In an interview given to Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he said "something's not going to happen" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at #MeToo's time.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, covette of Game of Thrones, also 31 years old, found that he had “firmly” to deal with this issue.
“ Personally, I think we’ve been wrong about masculinity. ”
"What teachings have we produced for young men who become adults, with regard to the problem that is now happening?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male personality.
He continued: “What behavior is wrong, what behavior has been indicted?
What does television and the street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they should behave this way to be a man?
I think it's really one of the fundamental issues of our time - how can we change that?
There is evidence, something that closes.”
In the interview, he also pointed out that he would not do any prologues or follow-up when the series closed the next summer, affirming that he had ended with "the fields of battle and horses".
Since November, Kit will be the host of a break by True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a volor.
Recently, the actor discovered that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my dear life," he said.
Rose interpreted Ygritz, the lover of Kit's personality, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, the family area of Leslie.
HIV / Sida: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases have been reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the diseases have been contaminated in sexual relations, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some regions of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way has been virtually zeroed, and the Chinese health authorities have confirmed during a conference held in the province of Yunnan.
However, from one year to another, the number of HIV positive and vulnerable people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a serious problem.
Homosexuality has been punished in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains very widespread.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 per cent to 90 per cent of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
In its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters claims that a GOP employee has disclosed data on senators, and declares "dangerous lies" and "computt theories".
Saturday, the U.S. Republic of Germany, Maxine Waters, announced the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages assigned to legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these statements were supported by experts and websites "of extreme right".
"Talkings, lies, and even lies" said Waters in a Twitter statement.
It would seem that the information disclosed included the addresses and phone numbers of American senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual aggression against the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The exit occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservation sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a member of Waters staff.
According to Waters, “this unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie. ”
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these false and false allegations, is not responsible for the absence of such information."
“ This false claim is completely false and a true lie. ”
Waters' statement quickly triggered online criticism, including on the part of Ari Fleischer, the former press attack on the House-Blanche.
"This is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the time needed to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something she has not done, she must not be angry.
She doesn't have to be a proponent.
It shall not cause the accused's reasons.
It must remain calm and serene. ”
Fleischer seemed to compare the response of Waters to the criticisms of the Democrats about Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry during the Jewish hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during my-commanded elections, also took part in his reflections on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters indicated that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the application of the relevant laws" regarding these false claims.
"We will ensure that the prisoners are disarmed," she added, "and that they are responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English has yet to fall. Rowan Atkinson's parish, sub-spy spy
It has now become a tradition to search the port of Brexit in any new British film, and this seems to apply to this repetition of the Johnny English action comedy, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and reopened in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic auto-satary on the issue of the evidence of our insensitivity represent the new export chance of our country?
In all cases, incompetence Johnny English, in the eyes of the blind and in the face of the cautchouchus, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicates before all it is a great chemical creation designed for a non-englophone film audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his suspicious attempts of glamorous charm, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspect of Mr. Bean and a good dose of type that runs a small note in the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics ceremony in London.
Initially, he was also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's television publications, now forgotten, leaving behind the chaos.
The last Johnny English has one or two sympathic moments.
I loved Johnny English as he drew closer to a helicopter when he wore a medieval armor and the rotor's balls hit his helmet gently.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is valued, although humor is rather insufficient and extremely superfluous, especially at the time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission cannot be made up of themselves in any confidence with the comedy.
The humor seems to be more directed towards children than to adults and, to me, Johnny English's colourful misunderstandings are less creative and less targeted than film gays kill Atkinson in Bean's personality.
The assumption that the United Kingdom is currently facing serious problems is that of the present.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British spy super secret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, in the great development of service agents - a low-density role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the taste that breaks the gap for a prime minister who is a corrupt person on the side of the crisis and who already suffers from a political incompatibility: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this person almost-Teresa-May, but there is no great chance to put himself in the scene.
Its advisers are informed of the fact that each active spy has been committed, she will have to make one of its withdrawals.
This means that he needs to draw Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic facility as a school teacher, but who is secretly giving lessons on how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful things here, because English offers a rock Academy training.
English is assembled in Whitehall for a meeting of emergency information and finds Bugh, his former long-lasting partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a role of hockey batting in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a gasped.
So, Batman and Robin, who create great admiration for His Majesty's secret services, turn to action and meet Olga Kurrylenko, the beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the first minister is dangerously under the influence of the technology billionaire charisma, which is said to be capable of solving the computer problems of Great Britain: the left-hand Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their hate of colorful blogs: under the fire of servers, they set fire to an exciting French restaurant; they create a chaos by making fun of Volta's luxury luxury; and English starts a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality cache, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All arrests are secured for this last sequence, but in spite of all, there is nothing wrong with children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't stop thinking, like other Johnny English films: can't the British cinematographic industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party has not developed a plan so that the British can work for four days but that they are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's working party has to consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
It appears that the party wants business leaders to benefit the workers of the economies generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while still touching the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The four-day shift was approved by the union convention as a means for workers to benefit from economic changes.
An important source within the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: "A policy review is scheduled to be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not be done in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that will be shared with the party's approach to rebalance the economy for workers and with its global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party would undertake a four-day working week during its general electoral campaign of 2017.
However, this ambition is not for the moment supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A working party spokesman stated: "A four-day working week does not constitute a party's policy and is not considered by it."
The additional Chancellor John McDonnell enjoyed the workshop last week to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power to the hands of "anonymous administrators" and "suppliers" in public utility companies.
The supplementary Chancellor plans also provide that current water companies' shareholders are not able to recover the total amount of their implementation as the labour force could operate "deductions" due to alleged deviations in conduct.
It has also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into business management councils as well as the establishment of an inclusive fund of shareholders that will pay 10 per cent of the private business capital to employees, which will amount to up to 500 per year dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was taken at least a week after the FBI's investigation of the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's conclusions could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the program "60 Minutes", asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out what it was that would prompt them to change their opinion.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
It was resolved, determined, without fault. ”
However, Graham's vote seems to be recorded in the stone.
"I have made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and there would be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett didn't categorically," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she named couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t find anything new that changes. ”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York, will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star palmarse and invest in a very impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Law of Central Park to benefit not only from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the people of the real goal of the festival, namely ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), viewers should perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary, send an e-mail to a world leader, telephone or make any other useful effort to raise awareness of the population against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still reach its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with free concert really make it possible to persuade them to call for action, or is it merely another example of "clicitism" - a situation in which people really think to make the difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" by its partners, who appeal for many different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to take commitments and adopt policies of more than $37 billion, which should change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with a discount of at least $10 billion already spent or raised.
The Group believes that the guarantee funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have undertaken to "help children develop their full potential," while promising Rwanda 35 million Sterling books to end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens messages.
"With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a bottom note in history," said the people of Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition program at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, following more than 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in the framework of nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and lose.
However, like the major civil rights defence movements and the fight against apartheid before us, we will arrive, as we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée is one of the artists who will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could call on the Marine to create a "block" to enter Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington may "if necessary" call the American Sea, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it works at the request of the legitimate government - is a prerequisite that enables it to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he would say.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"The United States, with our Marine, can ensure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, obstruct their energy to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that is defined as the "word of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are identical.
"As regards Iran and Russia, the economic option remains more or less in the use and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that it has "more than one cord on its back" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These declarations occur at the time when the Trump administration has committed itself to dynamizing its natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia with a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
In order to do so, the representatives of the Trump administration, including American President Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to leave the "inappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin a "prisoner" in Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which should double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of deliberate competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary for Energy, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said "I believe we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States resulted in negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the German Federation (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of submitting to the 2020 presidential elections, declared the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-command elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would like to present herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman must be at the summit," she says, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider submitting my application to the Presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public meeting, saying that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," she said.
Warren showed himself frank in his criticism of Trump and the candidate to the Supreme Court of that one, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a Thursday poll showed that the majority of Warren's voters are not of the opinion that it should be presented in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58 per cent of Massachusetts 'probable' voters said that the senator should not be present.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of very prominent Democrats mentioned for a potential campaign in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would take an official decision here in January.
Sarah Palin invokes Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's collection
Track Palin, 26 years old, has been in Iraq a year after his appearance in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is currently experiencing, what he feels is coming in, I can relate to other families who are suffering the consequences of the PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers return with," she told the audience at the assembly for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "the subject of the taboo" and said about his son and other former combatants that "they return a little different, tired, asking whether they were respected by their friends and members of the Air Force, and each other military, to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police service in Wasilla, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with a joint assault and violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of marital violence and possession of an arms in the state of Hebrews.
18 Columbia States and the district are in favour of a judicial dispute of the new asylum policy
18 Columbia States and the district of Colombia are in favour of a judicial objection to the new American policy that refuses asylum to victims by gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the district have deposited a memorial in favour of an asylum applicant who was responding to this policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not released.
She said that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs", had attacked her, but the American authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The State prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries faced with general problems of gangs and related violence.
The new US asylum policy has cancelled a decision made in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Council, which authorized the clandestine immigrants to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney-General of the Columbia District, stated on Friday in a statement that the new policy “is unaware of the decades of state, federal and international law”.
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the friend Carey.
Lawyers have also supported in the memory that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter the American economy at night, supporting them as more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "give the necessary work".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of joint violence and gang violence.
"Ale is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions," said the Sessions on 11 June, in its announcement of political status.
"Ale has never been designed to tackle all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people meet every day around the world."
Unexpected rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths double in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is more dramatic.
"I feel very tired," said Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old family mother, bringing her little brave boy back to Palu, in a city-wide evacuation center.
“ At every moment, a cancer infection of the bodies.
The water itself is rare."
Residents were seen going into their destroyed houses, collecting damaged goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals were submerged by magnitude 7.5.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of both arms and shoulders, were placed in front of Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of persistent persistent complaints.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent seismicness that swept the hotel room into the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," entrusted Haris to Associated Press, stating that his family was in the city for a marriage.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" through "propagandistic advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page publication on the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China in an American daily, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump announced the last Wednesday of the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after he accused China of attempting to join the American parliamentary elections on November 6, a charge that China rejects.
In accusing Pekin of wanting to join the American elections, Trump noted that American officials declared Reuters a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is appropriate for foreign governments to place advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing commercial war that has led them to apply mutual import tariffs.
At the beginning of the commercial war, China's tariff measures aimed at attacking the exporters of States such as the Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Pekin had done harm to American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article of opinion published in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "it is about to double its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press".
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government is serving the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paying advertising in the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the other hand, in the Beijing press, you will find a few controversial voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that Chinese may have on the Chinese economic trajectory, as the media firmly obey the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish" his article, not to mention any newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans align electricity with the Middle East elections due to the departure of Kavanaugh.
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of sexual aggression allegations, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, particularly in women, could occur during the next mid-command elections.
The feelings surrounding the case were extremely vivid, and most of the Republicans have already publicly indicated that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29, in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, stated that "we cannot go back."
Reeher added that he was convinced that the last minute's efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation were sufficient to calm the anger of the electors.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, the national leader and spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, "women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said on September 28th, according to Washington newspaper.
Friday morning, Mic reports, the demonstrators sang "The month of November comes !" in the Senate's coluir while the Republicans ruling the Judicial Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be demonstrated," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participating political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in the gangs' electricity and young electors from 18 to 29 years of age who, even if they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual aggression against the so-called Supreme Court, the analysts believed that the reaction could be life-threatening if the Republicans had advanced the confirmation.
According to NBC News, the former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of the last week that "It became a confusion for the GOP".
"It is not only the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh. It is also the way the Republicans handled the situation and the way they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps the elected Democrats to the television newspaper.
However, according to Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, the Americans seem divided in terms of the credibility of the two parties, a small majority thinking of the latter.
A new survey by YouGoov revealed that 41 per cent of the people interviewed believed in the Ford testimony, while 35 per cent said that they believed in absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh was probably lying or absolutely lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations advanced by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, after the pressure of Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath the last week before the Senate's judicial committee that she had been attacked by Kavanaugh while he was pregnant at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate to the Supreme Court would have shown him his genital parts during a party.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a new business that seeks to revaliate with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes part in the Free Platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as persons authorised to access such information.
In an exclusive interview given to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said he complained that Inrupt was looking to "dominate the World".
"We must do it now," he said on the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "line personal data store" or DPL.
This can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The specificity of the online personal data store is that it belongs entirely to the user to decide which type of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to the company's GDP, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, of some developers working on the project and a community of volunteers.
This week, the world's technological developers will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that his team and he are not yet in discussion with "Facebook and Google" in order to know if there is a need for a complete change where all of their business models are fully framed at once.
"We do not ask permission."
In an article published on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that "the mission [of Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new web age," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a Ecclesiastical of World War I decorated by the Cross of Victoria · Global Voices
The only Ecclesiastical Church of England to have received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, when he was attacked in Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two little children fired a memorial stone at a stand in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his little sons, claimed that he was "seriously symbolic" to throw the stone up 100 years after his father's explosion.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battle on the St.Quentin Canal “through a very spacious and violent bridgeyard of campaign and metallic cannons”.
Later, he was quoted on the shooting line and, with the "greatest bravare", guided the line before he jumped a canon of campaigning to him alone and assumed three soldiers of detached.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter named Lieutenant Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "one thing at the height I would never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the fall of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann expressed confidence that he was “very honored to be part of the trial” and added that“the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people. ”
The fans of mixed art have been revealed all night to watch Bellator 206. At the site, they had Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you spent all night looking at a Bellator 206 full, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event took 13 battles, six on the main board, and was broadcast directly throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face, the United Kingdom TVs were sealed when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some of us were unhappy to remain awake until the first hours of the morning, especially for the fight.
One Twitter supporter described the passage to an animated design for children as “a kind of bad joke. ”
With regard to the transmission, the vice-president of the marketing and communications at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation had that at 6 o'clock in the morning, this content was not adapted, so they had to switch to children's emissions".
"Peppa the Pig," yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator's company, said they were going to work on their programming to include future British television viewers.
“ I think that when I think about redistribution, I think we can probably find a solution, ” Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning one Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution before Monday, or Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program crashed, there were many messages in both terms and they weren't all friends.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But this was not a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won't happen next time.
We'll be limited to five fights instead of six - as we do usual - and we've tried to give more for the fans and we've lost everything.
This is a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" on the sex plan
The Olympic champion Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't do it before going to secondary school but "the whole world wasn't like me."
In the framework of the first radio release 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about the issue of homosexual rights to give to others of "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual emission presenter, Kirsty Young, took a leave of several months because of his illness.
As a result of the first Laverne issue, Daley believed that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "this was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength necessary to succeed.”
In order not to discover the whole world when they finally learned the truth about its sexuality, he wanted to prove that it was "something," he continued.
The two medallized Olympic bronze medal is now a renowned LGBT soldier and has benefited from his participation this year in the Games of Commonwealth in Australia in order to ask a larger number of countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
He said that he was expressing himself because he felt privileged to be able to live openly without restraints and that he wanted to give others hope.
The world's triple champion claimed that he "did not wait" to fall in love with a man - American movieist Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Darley married the last year of Oscar's laureate, 20 years old, but he said that the difference in age had never been a problem.
"When we live so many things at such a young age," he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died three years later - he said he was confident that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who knew the same height and bottom.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all his perspectives" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I didn't think he'd win a gold medal," he explained.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
But the Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley was convinced that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, "Father, you won't be here to be in the first rank," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and failed that he stopped breathing and that he died so that I could admit that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of all my life - crying in front of a crowd at the Olympics, there was nothing better," he said.
In addition, this inspired him to have his first choice of song - Heather Small's Depth - who accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the flesh of the chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 p.m. BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup Saturday bank
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this morning by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to go back to avoid it as a sad step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the second time, a record, was separated by Captain Jim Furyk of the Foreballs and Saturdays.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the fifth major champion has shared his day between the role of support and the comfort of his game in order to heal his head.
He has never been the greatest of the masters, even at the top of his career. At 48 years, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long race systematically imposes the paired cuts.
And as if the course wasn't as dramatic as it was, Mickelson, at the ninth Sunday match, facing Francesco Molinari, the British Open winner, who made this week's team with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 simple matches, take a good start, the Mickelson match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a double tap, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
“ He has great confidence in him.
It's a legendary champion and it added so many things to these teams throughout the past, all like this week.
I probably wasn't going to play two games.
I expected more, but it's like what happened and it's like what we're supposed to do.
He wants to be there, like all the others.”
Tomorrow, Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record of most of the Ryder Cup meetings.
This could mark the end of a career at Ryder Cup which has never actually reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has been active for 18 victims, 20 missing and seven missing, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's sad, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to move people, and it's kind of awesome to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had the pleasure of meeting him this week, which was exciting to see.
It does more than play. ”
The captain of the European election Thomas Bjorn knows that progress could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a non-reliable advance before the ordinary day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a criminal course.
The Danois argued his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros counted five points of advance on the Americans, but finally set himself on the top of the classification with the smallest possible difference on the arrival line, importing 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You don't stop reminding yourself that we go extensively to Valderrama; we had a great advance in Brooklyn, where we failed, and Valderrama, where we got, but in righteousness," said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 Classion to win the winner 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to go 10-6.
The story will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to the bottom tomorrow.
Go and do everything you need.
This is not finished before you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, namely to try to win this trophie, and above all, we must remain focused.
I have always claimed to focus on the 12 players in our field, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other hand - these are the world's best players."
Tell me about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's all the other pair of shortcomings.
Tomorrow, these are the individual performances that will be presented and it will go anywhere else.
It's great to be with a team when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested to the height of your full capacity as a golfer.
Here's the message to pass to players, it's the best of you tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he must take the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart, Jim Furyk, will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who obtained three points on four.
Furyk himself knew the two extremes of these last day's revolutions, after he had been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing out on the theme of the "Miracle de Médinah", where Europe had launched the victory.
"I remember every word," he explained in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, weighs a lot of pressure on the environment's matches.
We have established our training and put the guys as we think we should do, we try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has seen the task of conducting the counter-attack and facing Rory McIlroy in the first class pain, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest percentage of the class.
"I joined this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the entire course," Bjorn said on his simple selection.
The new German warship still reported
According to the local media, the new flag of the German Sea should have been used in 2014 to replace the old-fashioned warships due to the cold war, but it will not be in service until the next year due to inadequate systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the establishment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the Amiral ship of all the new frigates of Bade-Wortemberg, was reported in the first half of 2019.
The ship would have had to integrate the Marine in 2014, but the concerns arising after delivery had compromised the purpose of this ambitious project.
The four Bade-Wurtemberg class ships that the Marine has ordered in 2007 will replace the old-age flag of the Brüme class.
It is certain that they will have a powerful canon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ships missiles, as well as some sophisticated technologies, such as a radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest brakes for a period of two years outside the port of arrival.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delay means that pre-war-garden ships - which should allow Germany to project its extra-sea force - will already be obsolete when they are in service.
The last year, the F125 deadly frigate made the great title when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in service and sent it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Marine would return a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were unknown, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and material defects" that made the warship useless in case of deployment in combat missions.
Software deficits were particularly important because the Bade-Wurtemberg class ships will be operated by a crew composed of about 120 marines, which corresponds to half of the old crews of the Bremen class.
In addition, it seems that the ship is significantly loaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the marine capacity to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7 000 tonnes of Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the shortcomings of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole, including the training of the team, is also a problem.
It is said that it reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to 2.2 billion at the start.
The problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent alerts, according to which the German shipping force has decreased.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, recognized earlier this year that the Marine is actually "in short of ships capable of spreading".
The responsible said that the situation had had a bad effect with time, as old vessels had been detonated but no replacement ship had been designated.
He regretted that none of the classmates in the Bade-Wurtemberg class could join the Marine.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of souris keys
New research carried out in a region of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal the way the sunflowers use the landscape in their food demand.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and supranos pipelines, as well as the long-song noise keys and Daubenton in the garden of Inverwe, West Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property in order to monitor the activities of sound keys throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of its effects will enable it to determine the frequency of the crisis of the noise and the activities of the different species.
A map and report on the habitat will be drawn up to draw a detailed table of their behaviour at the territory level.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser to the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for the noise and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of beaches and the best way to preserve forests for sunflowers and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the sourial population has significantly decreased during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perpetuities and causes their habitat loss.
Eolians and lighting can also pose a risk, both as well as the dead-much paper and certain chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as attacks on company chats.
Mouse keys are not really blind.
However, given their night habits of hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS is responsible for the protection of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, taking the raw keys very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspections at and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Ecoses' souris keys on the website of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which opens eight of the ten species of Ecose's souris.
David Thompson, the domain manager, claims that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have an ideal place for the noise keys," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitats.
But there is still much to learn about noise keys, although the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what noise keys need to make progress."
It underlines the importance of verifying the presence of noise-shocks before the maintenance of property, because by destroying without the will of a single motherhood, the death of 400 women and children can result in the disappearance of all the local population.
Soursy keys are protected and it is illegal to kill them, destroy them, or destroy their prey.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Ecosassist responsible for Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide its help.
She said: "We still have much to learn about our keys and about many of our species, we do not know what is happening in their populations for the moment."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of violence while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has described the charges of violence against him as “false information, ” and he says that people “want to know each other ” by using his name.
His lawyers are trying to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and the Juventus was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid $375,000 to keep her silent on this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
With its 142 million fans in a video published directly on Instagram, a few hours after the dissemination of allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years of age, has classified this information as "false information".
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false information," said the camera's fifth laureate of the Gold Ballon.
"They want to make themselves out of the public using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player crying.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are trying to continue Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have qualified as "unacceptable denial of suspicions in the field of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would demand a remedy for "moral damages of a proportion of the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a follow-up to the Palms Casino hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night box, Ronaldo and Maorga were apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal violence would have occurred, according to documents deposited with Clark's court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo was released after the alleged incident and made sure that he was a "good-bye" to "99%" but that he did not know what was happening to the "1%" remaining.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that they had consent.
Mayorga also stated that she had returned to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a regulation to the friend because she felt "trembling by the prisoners" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to repeal this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a 100 million-euro contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret the departure of car manufacturers."
According to Greg Clark, the U.S. Secretary of State responsible for Trade, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if it had lost its status as world car construction leader after Brexit.
He added that he was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in his Burnaston car near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays on the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston vehicle - which manufactures the Auris and Avenues of Toyota vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our car," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concern is that car manufacturers qualify for the supply chain for Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is operated in "tendow stream", parts reach all 37 minutes of United Kingdom and EU suppliers for ordered vehicles.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without agreement, there could be disturbances at the border which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and loss of supplies.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day's inventory at his Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan on future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to benefit from the current success but also to gain this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4's Today issue.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other builders, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has become an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota has not been able to determine how long the production would be stopped, however, it has warned that further costs would reduce the competitor’s competitiveness and would end by costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the United Union trade union coordinator who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members were more concerned: "I think once these jobs disappear, they never come back."
A government spokesman stated: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The House-Blanche announces that the meeting of Trump and Rosenstein could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and General Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, could be "repatriated for a week", while the struggle for candidate to the Supreme Court continues.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's work, the Special Adviser to Investigate Russian Energy in the Elections, the links between Trump's and Russia's employees and the possible obstacles to justice exercised by the President.
The question of whether Trump will return or not to the Assistant Attorney-General, and therefore endanger Mueller's independence, is to feed the rummers in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken to bring a micro to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein didn't make those statements.
However, last Monday he presented himself to the House-Blanche, while he was about to be released.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump indicated that he "would not" refer to Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was reported to avoid an encounter with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee that witnessed Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week's investigation on complaints against Kavanaugh, still delaying the Senate's vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press attack, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if one week is still given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to have the press on the screen."
The statement would be answered by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has had no press conference at the House-Blanche.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the shortness of the conferences was not due to an avvert for the "demagogical" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they spread the gallery."
Then she learned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without any evidence, she added that "the President participates in more questions-responsibility sessions than any other President before him": "We have checked the figures."
Press conferences will always be in place, Sanders said, but "if the press is able to ask the President of the United States directly, it is definitely better to talk to me.
We are trying to do it very often, you have seen it very well in recent weeks, and this will take place at a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Regularly, Trump answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending public meetings or press conferences with officials.
It is rare that there will be press conferences alone.
This week, in New York, the President may have shown why, by making a decorated appearance and at times by a strange appearance before the gathered journalists.
With regard to fear of Brexit, the Secretary for Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary for Health has written to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their country's gratitude and wish them to remain behind Brexit.
The Scottish parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within a period of less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of statutory applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer negotiations on retirement continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should result in this automatic decision.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations in the absence of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very difficult for each of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate to what extent I consider the contribution of each staff member, whatever his nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
The Ecosse is all about your home and we really want you to stay here."
After a headache, Christion Abercrombie undergos an emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, from Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the second of the Tigers of Tennessee, was urgently operated after a wound on the head Saturday when the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 was missing.
Rod Reed, chief trainer of the state of Tennessee, told journalists that the injury was happening just before the middle of the day.
"He got on the touch line and went out there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a city and offering it another examination.
A representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was from the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris explained that there was no "not yet any details about the type or scope of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury had occurred.
Abercrombie, a 2nd-year-old athletes, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five plasmas on the whole Saturday before leaving the match, which took his entire season to 18 plasmas.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp rights if they acquire a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they buy a property in the United Kingdom and the additional money will be used to help the homeless in the context of the new conservation regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the right to press will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Tresor is expected to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher rate of pay if they buy a property in the United Kingdom - the additional money will help the homeless, announce Theresa May today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by undertaking to provide more affordable accommodation and target people with high incomes.
The increase in the right to strike will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will serve to strengthen the government's efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surplus - which has now been added to the right of current stamps, including the highest levels imposed two years ago on secondary residences and purchases - could reach 3%.
The Tresor expects the project to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year.
About 13 per cent of the new London buildings are purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, thus grueling prices and preventing prime players from making a place on the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “study cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy occurs a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the law of smoking in order to help young people acquire a first house.
In accusing large construction companies of maintaining high-level real estate prices by acquiring land without using them, she invited Ms. May to withdraw quotas on suitable housing in order to regulate the "immobilial disbursement" in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the removal of "without fault".
He also wanted to give advice to more extensive authorities to build new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I said that I would devote my first post to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to all who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is so easy for individuals not living in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house and for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having access to property has become distant and the misery of the without-abri remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "last ambition" is to become the eco-selector at a given time.
The 42-year-old Ecossais is pleased to highlight the challenge of reinvigorating the North-East Club, which currently takes up the third place of League 1 to three points of leadership.
He dropped the Stadium of Light this year after leaving St. Mirren in Premier League echoes the last season.
“I had to play for my country as a player.
I've been selected for Division B and that's all," Ross said at the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But I grew up following Scotland's matches in Hampden with my father and it's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would only be presented if I succeeded in the management of the club.”
The presidents of Ross as voters in Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former technician of Alloa Athletic said he did not hesitate to join behind the so-called embrematic names in such a large club, which had already delineated the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "Can I join this club in Prime League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it is undoubtedly belonging to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably not think of me as a success here unless I can get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as an coach, after a period of time as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in the heart trainers.
He then helped Alloa to rebuild a delegation in the third division and transformed St. Mirren, who was on the board, into a major champion's fan next season.
Ross now says more about his career in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
The arrest of Alloa "was no doubt a real carrefour," he recalls.
"I really found that being a trainer was better suited than playing.
That seems strange because I'm well out, that I've earned my life well, and that I've benefited from some of the most valuable events.
But it's sometimes hard to play.
There's a lot of details to fix every week.
I continue to live in times of stress and stress at work, but being a trainer is going to be very good.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been with all my adult life."

The summer canyon has raised the revenues of British pubs in difficulty, but has increased the pressure on restaurant channels.
The figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded an increase of 2.7% of their sales in July, but income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA Board of Directors, who compiled the data, said: "The permanent isolation and longer participation of England at the World Cup made the month of July following the model of June, where the bars had known an increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants, which had even more important shock.
The decrease of 1.8 % registered in June in the restoration sector has only been completed in July.
The pubs and bars where alcohol is served are far more popular, with more similar points than the restaurants that drop them.
Food pubs have also suffered from sun effects, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and get a glass.
In the pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent per month and food decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, a specialist analyst of the RSM and hotel, said: "These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
Meteo and the impact of major social or sports events remain the most important factors in the external market sales.
It is no wonder that the restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, which is a decrease of 4.8% per annum, especially painful, in addition to constant pressures on costs.
The long and hotness could not have been less suitable for the food sector operators and the time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we knew in August will give us a decent pension. ”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slowness in the implementation.
The sales of the industry are monitored by the Cuffer Peach Tracker for the United Kingdom pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined business figure of over 9 billion Sterling books and is the norm in the established industry.
On social media, a five-year-old has secret accounts that he hides from his parents
According to a survey, a five-year-old - some of whom are only 11 years old - has secret accounts on social media that he hides to his parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in “false Insta” pages
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they had a "primary" account to show their parents
A child over five - some of whom are only 11 years old - opens an account on the social media he keeps hidden in adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed a rapid growth in the "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of the students said to manage a "primary" account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A 13 - year - old woman who fell asleep on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “sympathize with me. ”
According to a study conducted by Digital Avarenss UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference of Independent Schools (HMC), 40% of the 11-18-year-olds have a double profile, half of those admitted to have private accounts.
The head of CSM Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Elidh Doyle will represent the athletes at the Scottish Athletes Board of Directors.
Eliidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletes Board of Directors as non-executive director at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most exotic athlete in athletics, and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive experience gained at the international level these ten years.
"Eilid has a great respect for the rest of the British and World Athletic Community, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from its participation in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I really wanted to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and lead this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres in 1996 and 400 metres in the Atlantic Olympic Games where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had an AVC.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would be restored or at what point.
It was a trying job, but I got back completely, I'm ready to go, and today I'm going to have a good time!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Online advertising on the screen that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a withdrawal should compare mothers who are in love with the cows during treatment.
In order to mark the launch of what is called the "first silent shooting in the world", Elvie, a large public technology company, launched an audacity inspired by a music video clip to show the freedom that her new shooting has offered to alleviating women.
In a garden of cows full of wool, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I bring myself, but you don't see mourning" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's my heart, not my mothers."
The proverb continues: "I will pump it, pump it, I will feed the babies, I will pump it, I will pump it, I will help the women bring the milk."
However, advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to online policing.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many say it makes light on the "hours" of the dairy industry.
"A stone decision that it should use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth to milk, except their babies are taken away in the days following their birth," wrote one of them.
Elvie's drawing is discrepancies in an ally support (Elvie/Mère)
Another commented: "This is understandable trauma to mother and baby.
But why not use them to make the publication of a joke for mothers who keep their babies? »
Another added: "A advertising if disconnected."
Others have defended advertising, for example, by acknowledging that she found the song "shilarant".
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I'd have bought one if I was still on vacation.
Pomper gave me the impression of being empty.
Advertisement is a little dingy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a beautiful publication for mothers who take their milk (often on their place of work or toilets) and feel like "fucking" and "fucking"
This is not a advertising that makes the exhibition of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women appear to have been dancing with the dissimmated cut-out discretes in their support.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the toilet say they have the impression of being empty.
However, Elvie's drawing is completely silent, without sons or bulls and is discreetly inserted into a support for marriage, which gives women the freedom to cry, to have their babies, and even to get out of their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and DPE at Mother's daughter, commented: "The Elvie drawing is such a revolutionary product that it deserves an academic and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between the mother-in-laws and milk cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in an appealing and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new child will seek.
This isn't the first time Elvie took out one of the newspapers.
During the week of the fashion in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Martha Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of children from migrants have been placed in silence in a camp at the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased considerably since the number of monthly crossings at the border has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that Trump’s talks and strict administration policies have been able to make children’s placements more complex.
Traditionally, most of the respondents were themselves non-paper immigrants and were afraid of compromising their own ability to stay in the country by bringing up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members should submit their digital inputs and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had filed an application for treatment of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons had no judicial precedents.
"As many as 80% of the people who are respondents or members of their family are illegal here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
As a result, we continue to follow these people," said Albence.
According to refugee activists, in order to speed up the case of children, the authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to be compared to the court in the month following their detention, rather than 60 days later, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will be represented by videoconference, rather than by anyone, in order to complain about their legal status before an immigration judge.
Unelected persons will be released quickly.
According to the interventions and reports submitted in recent months by the refugee network, more children remain in detention, more likely to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to acts of violence or attempted escape.
In a large establishment such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected due to his size, according to the rights defenders of the child.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to tell their friends about it could increase a trauma that many have to deal with.
Syria asks the US, French and Turkish 'occupation forces' to withdraw from it.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moulam, also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the war in this country is now in its eighth year.
Moulalem, also vice-president, said that foreign forces were on the Syrian territory illegally, with the intention of combating terrorism, and that they would “really [would] be treated”.
"They must withdraw immediately and without condition," he said to the assembly.
Moulalem supported that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 36,000,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have been moved from their homes.
He said that Damas would continue “to carry on this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed” both by both terrorist groups and by any “unlawful foreign presence”.
The United States accounts for some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of which advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war - torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moulalem said about refugees, that conditions were favourable to their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "producing irrational concerns" which had discouraged refugees from coming back.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They are in the process of policying what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria as a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would not be concluded.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last rebel rebel Idlib has enabled political negotiations to progress.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has avoided a large-scale attack on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moulalem pointed out, however, that the agreement provided for "precious times" and expressed the hope that military measures would target the Jihadists, in particular the fighters of the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who will be "removed".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members in order to prepare a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moulalem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to “the revision of the articles of the present constitution”, and submitted a reservation against any interference.
Why Trump will succeed a second mandate
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be realized in 2020 unless, as many liberal TV viewers undoubtedly expect, the destruction and the scandal lead him to leave his presidency early.
What would no doubt be "The End of a Presidency!"
At this point, the public does not show any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, scored more than twice, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and virtually tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million TV viewers at large hours, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC, which reaches 3.5 million TV viewers at large nights, is the first cable TV channel.
"It's a matter that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the representative of the ABC's drama series "Designed Survivor", which speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
In Scowell, a famous comical audience of "Just the Funny Parts: And some incredible truths about how to fly in the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory for his part.
She recalls having taken a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked him.
"He answered, "Because he made me laugh," said Mrs. Scowell.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, contrary to what is happening on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe c. Wade case if immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
To disconnect is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
However, this goes beyond being a well-known citizen when we look back at a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used a "deep knowledge" for his book "Fear", on the clothing suit of another $15,000 from Paul Manafort (“a full-fledged garment” according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the extraordinary descriptions that Stormy Daniels provided of, uh, the Anatomy of Mr. Trump.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"If a part of what he's doing gives the impression of seeing a television show, it's because he's making you appreciate something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing teams and the daily returns of Trump (to fight with NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't be allowed to miss an episode, but we're on the train.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees north of Kauai, but he went inside to watch MSNBC while registering CNN.
He could not stand up, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was preparing to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the game.
"I remember the time when all these popular emissions were eliminated and people said, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," I was confident by Mr Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of curse, but it seems they were right."

The money from the outside enquiries the most sealed mid-command elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania was inundated with money, thanks to an adjustment in the membership of the Congress, which allowed two subscribers to discuss the same seat.
This district of Pittsburgh, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who has broken his seat in another circuit during the recent special elections.
Lamb is measured at another titler, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly defeats the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old rounds were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The course of the new 17th district gave rise to a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major sectors of the financing of the parties, the Committee of the Congress for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of justice in March of a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States planned to penalize Salvador for its support for China, then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Pekin, which Washington had little opposition.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Spanish President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners released the direction of the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the Department of State decided to summon the heads of the American diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
However, sanctions have been imposed only in the case of Salvador, which has received US$ 140 million estimated in 2017, in particular to control drug abusers and to provide development and economic support.
The penalties envisaged, which included financial aid reductions and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
While the internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from returning to the United States.
By September, however, the senior officials of the administration had clearly indicated that they wanted the Conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to show the importance of the administration of the meeting, the diplomats have made known.
And the three American emissaries are peacefully returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishments on the part of Washington.
A spokesman from Mr. Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the cover of anonymity.
Their proposals were consolidated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who has also remained anonymous.
Learn the history
The next shot could be the report of Special Advocate Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now based on substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also lead his investigation into the question of a connivance of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of the Congress changes in hand, Mr. Trump will be required to report to that body, at the time he intends to represent himself before the electors and perhaps a jury composed of his peers.
There are many 'yes' here, and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - neither his approvals in Europe.
We all have decisions to take on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officials were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held his head and repatriated the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed, and there is no chance to avoid the years of pregnancy that have followed.
The course of history revolves around these developments and the inexhaustible course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are currently faced with a number of these challenges.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sent the assistant to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the result of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a guilty situation since this paper has reported that last year he proposed to register the president secretly and issued assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the Times report was inaccurate.
"What will we answer if the investigation recently requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is committed to the Supreme Court in spite of the allegations of sexual aggression and the evidence of dishonesty?
And above all, are we going to vote in the election for a Congress that will ask for accounts to Mr. Trump?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be a long winter.
But I'm convinced we didn't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who had previously occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, six years later, she sent me out of the satellite channels on the swastika tree table.
With this heritage heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, trusting in Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna jeudi, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the European League.
An injury in the genou privates the ground environment Graham Dorrans from his first participation in the season until the match zero 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to take the best of such a result to perform exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," said 31-year-old.
"We're in the game thinking of getting something and we're split up with a point.
We may have been able to bring it to an end, but, in the whole, no match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better at the first half and we returned in the second half and were the best team.
Jeudi, this is another important European evening.
With a little chance, we can expect three points, but this will be a difficult match because they have made a good result during their last match, although I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result with the people behind us.
The last year has been very difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the boys love themselves very much; training is quality.
We hope we can go ahead now, leave the last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find the shadow due to this fear about their evaporation
Although the participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be treated, few people asked the question with their families.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the long-term cost of care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't need to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Insurance Branch.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not communicate with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to determine where and how you can receive care, because these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your consultant is also able to help you set up a way to pay these costs.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a long-term long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your property - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the past.
Provide a health care search that will allow you to identify a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider also a search for your financial resources.
You choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is in the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please enter these details in a written document to be well prepared.

His injuries do not threaten his life, and the police have launched a call to witness.
Seismes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful seismic and tsunami that destroyed the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, the authorities announced, and the balance should be lifted.
The communications are parallelized, the relief services have not been able to receive any information about the Donghea regency, a region located in the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
A few important facts about Palu and Donghea, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the point of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, where the population was estimated to be 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the Seismic and Tsunami took place.
Donghea is a region over 300 km (180 miles) east of the island of Sulawesi.
The population of the regency, an administrative region located below one province, was estimated to be 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, and particularly of the coastal region of Doggara.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donghea have been affected by tsunamis several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Donghea.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donghea in 1996, making nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Sismatic Fire Circle and is regularly followed by seisms.
Here are some of the main seismic and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which took place on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that erupted in 14 countries, bringing 226 000 victims to the Indian Ocean, including more than half the people in Aceh.
2005: Several violent seisms have taken over the west coast of Sumatra from the end of March to the beginning of April.
A few hundred people are buried on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude seisma reached southern Java, Indonesia's most common island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and made almost 700 victims.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude seat took off the city of Padang, capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake destroyed one of the Isle of Mentawai, along the coast of Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami more than 10 metres away that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial seismy has resulted in the regression of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the destruction caused by the 2004 suicide and death tsunami.
No tsunamis have been caused this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by flooding.
2018: The Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which killed more than 500 people, is mainly north of the island.
The seisma destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of temporarily blocked tourists.
Sarah Palin's adopted son is arrested for joint violence
Track Palin, son of Alsaka former governor of Alaska and candidate to Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, aged 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was interviewed for suspicions of marital violence, contrary to a notice of marital violence and resistance to arrest, to the words of a communication published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a woman's sex knowledge who tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is temporarily detained in Mat-Su's provisional detention centre and is held in non-guaranteed custody of $500, KTUU said.
He compared himself to the Swedish court, saying "not guilty, it is safe" when his complainant was asked, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he may be sentenced to a prison sentence that can go to a year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a minor category B offence, sentenced to a prison day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged aggression.
The case is under way before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of joint violence, of interference in the report of a crime of marital violence and of possession of an arms in the state of emergency in connection with the incident.
His partner had claimed that he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by Veterans groups in 2016 after having established a link between the violent behavior of his son and the PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Sex in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people were killed following the seismic attack on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude seismic caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are on board and the victim's balance should rise in the coming days.
The seisma was declared just outside the center of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos published on social media show the impact point.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors call for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York asylum attorney who has made eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would use a truck named Home Depot to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overlooking the road of the Pittons and a cyclist in October last.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has "intendedly" murdered the eight victims and infected "intendedly" of serious physical damage, according to the declaration of intention to request capital punishment lodged at the South New York District.
These two charges are likely to involve the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this attack, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 chief charges, including eight death charges for fund-raising, generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and car destruction.
The attack required "a minute preparation and a premeditation", the prosecutors claimed, according to the method used by Saipov of "dangerous, cruel and inexhaustible".
“Syfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco,” states the intentional statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
New York's southern district had not claimed the death penalty in the context of prosecutions for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was declared guilty of the murder of two drug dealers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a new Yorkese federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were committed to conspiracy and spying for the USSR during the two years that followed the cold war.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chassis on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has demonstrated a lack of reservations in the days and months following the tragedy, according to judicial figures.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been motivated to take care of Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show Daesh's team in his hospital room, the police explained.
He appealed in no way to the 22 chiefs of charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that he was clearly disappointed in the decision to pursue.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept his appeal for guilt and to condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only extend the traumatism associated with these events for all interested people," said Patton.
The Saipov defence team had already asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has today promised to "mobilise the popular army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former U.S. Independence Party stated that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics - as one of the Members of Theresa May suggested, should be charged with negotiating with the EU.
In the course of Birmingham, the Conservatory of Ban Peter Bone stated that the United Kingdom would "have already been released" if Mr Farage had been a secretary in Brexit.
But the dilemma that Ms. May faced in order to reconcile her deeply divided groups was highlighted by the conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union who joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has a bad idea of keeping his plan of commitment to Chequers despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to remain both in the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach agreement with Brussels despite the hostility - and would require Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its programme and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "drive away from Chequers".
He believed that Mr Farage should have become a partner and should be entrusted with the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would already be out," he said.
Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We are not delivered into world wars to submit ourselves.
We want to make our own legislation in our own homeland."
Mr. Bone distinguished the suggestions that the public opinion had developed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people turned the page and wanted to stay is completely false."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who likes to come out, was also present on the march to tell journalists: "I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Everyone is not appreciated by the great public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and of our militarists who silence the streets and make us vote first.
Leave Chequers and start listening.”
In a message directed to Ms. May, she added: The Prime Ministers preserve their jobs when they respect their promises."
"Mr. Farage pointed out to the assembly that politicians should be inclined to "press the pressure" if they were on the point of betraying the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They tried to break the Brexit, and today we say to them, "We will not let you go out with it."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is on the point of bringing Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has allowed us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, the pro-Europeans have marketed through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of militants broke the custody banners against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
His worklist, Lord Adonis, was moved by conservatives because of security issues regarding the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are those who assure us that they are able to put in place the information systems and all technology for Canada, more, for the free border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real thing.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider the possibility of presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future on Saturday at a public meeting in the West of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequently critical vote on President Donald Trump, presented for the November election against Geoff Diehl, representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was located at the centre of the speculation that it could face Trump in 2020.
The afternoon afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electors in a public assembly since Trump's operation.
A participant asked him if he intended to present himself to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman at the head of the state."

Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton leads to the world title after the team's leaders allowed him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It soon became evident from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified to become the leader of Lewis Hamilton Saturday last week that the Mercedes team's signal would play an important role in the competition.
From the field position, Bottas took a good start and played Hamilton on the side while he defended his position in the first two races, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the first stop and left Hamilton to run into the tower at the bottom of the poloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes passed through a later tour and found behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage of a road operation that saw Ferrari's pilot leaving the inner part at risk of stopping after a double defence attempt in the third direction.
Max Verstappen is part of the last line of the grid and was seven at the end of the first tour to celebrate his 21-years.
He then dominated a large part of the course all the time now his lungs to see a quick arrival and to advance Kimi Raikkonen to the fourth place.
It finally arrived at the stops at the 44th tour, but it was not able to speed up the pace in the eight remaining towers, Raikkonen is classified as the fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri has done a wonderful job all weekend and has been a real gentleman who has let me go.
The team has done an extraordinary job to get two," said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language
At a last Saturday meeting, President Donald Trump was moved by Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not released Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in Virginia-Occidental, the President did not directly disclose Ford's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee, but he claimed that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad, mean and dishonest".
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that would happen in the Senate these last days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry and angry and mean and mean,” he said.
"Looking at the disclosures and the fugitives, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, have you disclosed information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We disclosed information... No, we did not disclose information," he added, thinking about the senator's impression.
Feinstein received in July last from Ford the letter describing in detail the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place early September, but Feinstein did not want the expulsion from his office.
"I didn't dissimulate Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," said Feinstein to the committee, saying The Hill.
"She told me to keep this confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the meeting: "I'm going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the President had heard that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the mystery, they're trying to know who hurt them, who have to break up to gain power and control," said the president of the Mediaite.

The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.

An air traffic controller has been killed by hundreds of people on board a plane to escape from the seismo.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is greeted in heroes after his departure by ensuring that an aircraft transporting hundreds of persons can be safely decommissioned.
More than 800 people were killed and many others were killed after an important seismic attack on the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong complaints continue to engulf the region, and a large number of people are buried in the city of Palu.
But despite the departure of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to give up his position in the violent tour of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed on the spot to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at the moment, can be safely decoyed.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he heard that she was going to fall.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the disaster prevention agency of the country, indicating that access to the cities of Donghea, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance would continue to be honored because many bodies were still under the roofs and a large number could not be protected," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman
The waves measuring up to six meters have excavated Palu, which will celebrate a mass funeral tomorrow.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and lives.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute, a cancer of the bodies.
The water itself is rare.
The mini-markets are packed everywhere. »
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we do not know what they are going to find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could cause it."
Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the military of the country: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was kidnapped earlier this year by ceisms in Lombok, which has killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man disappeared after the crash of a plane in the chain.
The air carrier who managed the flight that broke into a Gulf of the Pacific in Micronesia now claims that a man was fired after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the flying plane.
Air Niugini stated in a communiqué that since the seventh afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the person concerned.
The airline has not responded immediately to requests for more precise information on the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local ships have participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft has landed the water by attempting to land at the Chuuk airport.
The authorities stated Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact timing of the events remain uncertain.
The airline and the American Marine reported that the aircraft had landed in the lake near the landing track.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others would have been able to swim in the water until the plane's rescue exits were running.
he claimed that the board agents had panicked and created, and that he was suffering from minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that the ships working near the improvement of a vessel which had also participated in rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the ground before the aircraft was flying about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have been killed in air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none of them were affected by Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night where the woman was burned alive
The charge was updated on Saturday in the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He told the jury how he used telephone calls from a laptop to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night the last one died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained location data from several portable phones that indicated that Tellis and was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, related to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was in Chambers while he was trying to meet his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford compared to the Saturday bar and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he “he [had] said because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another incoherence lies in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The telephone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, Tellis removed the SMS, calls and coordinates of Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The defence must start its appeal tomorrow.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.

Another Black?!
A New York bride continues a couple in justice to have licensed her after a "racist" text
A New York nun continued to be a court-martial husband after receiving an error message from her mother who complained that she was still a black man.
The couple refuse to be racist, and they like the follow-up to an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his opposition by finding in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new one, was black when he arrived for his first day of work.
“ NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE A NOIRE”, wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after having understood his ghetto, "bad on the ice," Plasco-Flaxman referred to Ms. Maurice, explaining to him that their former young, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was just waiting for a Philippines.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and then sent to her by a Uber.
Now, Maurice continues to bring the couple to justice in order to obtain compensation for her resignation and to claim a compensation of $350 per day for the service at home for six months for which she was initially imprisoned but without contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do this kind of thing," she explained to Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to racism allegations by saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that he would not be able to trust him after he had committed the crime.
"My wife had sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco to Post.
"But will you trust your children to someone with whom you have been wronged, even if it was a mistake?
Your new one?
Let's go!"
Similar to a "extortion" trial, Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months old and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you follow someone like this?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the case is still under way, the court of the public opinion did not hesitate to condemn the couple on the social media, the bloggers for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify themselves at a time when they spoke, starting a new letter.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who first fought for it before its publication.
It's very interesting, knowing what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small hours in the fields, would be optimistic about her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had been a "twelve" save after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as “a very important member of our family, ” and she adds that her father was very proud of her final success.
"It was a very calm man, and it wasn't a pretender," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we're proud of him, even though it's not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although this is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to tell her yesterday on the phone.
On his arrival, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save her life.
"There was no regular appeal to explain how bad the situation was, we do not expect it to happen," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to prevent her from dying in the next two minutes and that I should tell her yesterday.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given him to maintain the cardiac rhythm were in the process of slowing down and getting out of his system.
She was dead a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all about to go away.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should have had the cut."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, after her daughter's death, rides in the plane with the other passengers, without any concern for the test she was going through.
"No one was in the race," she said.
"I had a broken head, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight I've experienced this huge sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Injury women deposit postal cards to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost their loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys showed, on a gallous bridge, e-mail cards confirming inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
The son of Ms. Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I'm forced to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and still in Lydney, said his son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“All the world knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile lighted any part of it."
However, he left his job before he died, since he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he was murdered.
Ms. Davis said, "I strongly believe that there has been an effect on training."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can see and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not keep on the watch, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-term friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt tired, depressed or else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
It was at its lowest on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, there was no visual contact with them or anything."
She pointed out that her death had represented a tremendous traumatism for them, but they had to go out: "It's disgusting to the family.
It's ruining us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was in play while the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for - a limited investigation in time, limited in its scope - we might bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would not "float" in a partial statement.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican MPs not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reticence is due to the choice of the moment.
The elections will only take place in five weeks, or 6 November. If, as planned, the Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to make the choice of the person they want at the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through his wife, Ashley, who was then his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has presented its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We still do not know if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of deserters "fall" under Kim's direction
The number of North-Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's accession to power seven years ago, declared a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of the Southern Union, stated that 1,127 deserts had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing passengers' charges were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of North-East deserters will finally be able to grant South-Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that over 30,000 North Koreans have broken the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most were by China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to understand than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as clandestine migrants rather than as refugees and refugees often in force.
The relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in war - have improved significantly in recent months.
More recently this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the framework of maintenance focused on the decollarization negotiations that remained until then.
This happened after the historic June meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in large lines, to work in favour of a denuclearized Korean pendulum.
However, on Saturday, North-Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, has caused American sanctions the absence of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualifies Brett Kavanaugh as "historic", and claims he is inappropriate to sit at the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate to the Supreme Court of the "historic" Brett Kavanaugh and stated that he was not fit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments in the framework of a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have treated her "historic", said Pelosi about her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh before the Senate Committee of the Last Judiciary.
Kavanaugh had not, with emotion, filed allegations that he would have sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh showed very emotional and sometimes failed to cry and got excited by calling his family and his years of lycee.
He also explicitly condemned the democracies sitting on the committee, qualifying the allegations of "great and coordinated murder" organized by liberals that Hillary Clinton had lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he is discrepancy himself with these statements and the way he has taken them to Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was angry when he was asked if she would try to destroy Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and if the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also inappropriate to sit in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about any decisions made by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
During his hearings of confirmation of the charges, Mr. Kavanaugh chose the question of possible reverse of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to the court and wait for what we say: "it's not wonderful," said Pelosi.
And women must serve them.
It's a legitimate diaribe, months and years of anger, and it can't do it without tears.
"We cry when we do," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was a part of the frame, who told me that she was also in pain when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and crying: "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I’m angry. ”
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant."
The tears are allowed to exuse anger, in part because they are fundamentally incomprehensible.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in a office dominated by men, where I was a day when I found myself in pain of an inexplicable root, was to have been hit by the skin of an elderly woman - a cold guide that always had a little terrible - which led me into a ladder.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They believe you are sad and disappointed because they have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been taken into an extracommunal business on board a ship called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said he had no reason for her not to explore the idea of submitting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a mindful decision," she confided in me crying, 30 years later.
"There have already been seven other candidates in college, and the last thing he missed was one more person.
Someone called it "Blanche-Neige and the Seven Nines."
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in the fund collection, and she had vowed that she would not participate in less than $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her partners, who usually gave $1,000 to men, owed her $250.
"Do they think I have the right to a rabbi?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was troubled by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult for the collection of funds and the target of voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sex - that she felt confused.
"You would think I was making a nervous depression," recalls Ms. Schroeder about the pressure reaction to her.
“ You thought Kleinex was my sponsor.
I remember being asked what they were going to put on my tombal stone.
"She's crying"?
How trade war between the United States and China could benefit in Beijing
The first rescues of the US-China trade war have been overwhelming, and although the battle is far from over, a long-term dispute between countries could be won in Beijing, according to experts.
American President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important increase came this week with new customs duties affecting US$ 200 billion items (150 billion sterling books), thus taxing half of all goods from China coming to the United States.
Each time, Pékin recovered in nature, currently breaking the customs duties of 5 to 10 per cent of US$ 60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will fall apart.
Getting to Washington is going to surrender to the demands, but going publicly to the United States would be too burdensome for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts believe, however, that if Pekin can properly play its role, the pressures of the American commercial war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependency of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in one or more countries is much more dangerous than what observers have recognized before," said Abigail Grace, a research partner who focuses on Asia, to the Central for New American Security thinking group.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild this country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Turning to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam stated that the situation in the country would improve.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country which they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have destroyed the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million other people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding this devastated country.
He pointed out, however, that he would not accept any conditional aid or aid from the countries that seemed to be insurgent.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won Ryder Cup 2018 by fighting the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on the European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish captain team, Thomas Bjorn, broke the barrier of 14.5 points needed to fight the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in difficulty during most of the tournament, focused on his departure from the water at 16th in par-3, passing his due to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has chosen in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players to have never reached 5-0-0 since the current tournament format, which is the first edition since 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated from 5-4 by the most well placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, turned 2 and 1 face to the English Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Cups Ryder, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the champion of Europe at all times with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than I am.
It was a year of movement.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get back the cup.
What matters is the team, and I am glad to be able to help it," said Garcia with emotion after the European victory.
It passes the flame to its companion John Ram who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, the last Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride, having beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup career.
A surprising statistics for one of the biggest golfers of all time, who has won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has had a bad weekend to find the fairies, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the high-level golf all the time of the tournament.
American Captain Jim Furyk commented after a decade's performance on his team: "I'm proud of these games, they're beat.
This morning, we had some time when we had pressure on Europe.
We've left.
I got Thomas's hat.
It's a big captain.
His 12 players were all very good.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You need to inclinerate.
We’re going too far. ”
