FANO Russia will hold the final Expert session
The Federal Scientific Organizations Agency (FANO Russia) will, together with RAN, hold the third Expert session, " Evaluating the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations " .
The meeting will be finalized in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, in the press release in the edition of Lent.Ru.
The third meeting plans to submit the results of the Expert Session for the year and draw up the outcome list of indicators for assessing the results of scientific organizations.
The participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the evaluation criteria.
The third expert session will be an ongoing event in each of the events of the formation of a uniform approach for all three academic academics to the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the resulting version of the normative documents is in agreement.
At the close of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," said FANO expert-analytical manager Elena Aksenova, Russia.
Representatives will participate more than one of Russia's scientific institutions.
As a result, the resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting began on 10 September in Moscow on 16 September 2014 at the address: city of Moscow, Solanca Street, home 14.
Scientists have found ways of discovering the natural stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz studied turbulence and its impact on chemical unity in the stars.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow the star to search for relatives, that is, from one of the classrooms.
The results of their research have been published in Nature magazine and can be found briefly on the University’s website.
The cause of the same chemical composition of nearby stars is turbulence in the areas of gas before the formation of the star.
Even if the birth of the star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of birth and the region of education of the star-parents.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of the stars outside the classroom could lead to a difference in its chemical content from that of its relatives in the classroom.
The results of the modelling carried out by astrology show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, the supercomputer was modelled by two interstellar gas flows, which together formed clouds.
This object has been transformed into a cluster for several million years through its own gravitational activity.
Scientists have added fresh labels to the original gas flow and have found that rapid turbulence in the cloud achieves a high level of chemical unity.
As atrophysics, their research has shown that it is possible to search for astronomers on chemical composition, as well as to identify possible regions of education for such objects.
Karrati police arrested 20 years after a high-speed motorcycle attack
Motocycle was confiscated after they crossed 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through Bushend to hide from the police in Pillbar.

Lavour: Russia will not "open the door" for new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia won't knock the door for new sanctions.
Today, the head of MID RDF Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of IGIMO.
If our responses to the new wave of anti-terrorism sanctions are reflected, I will not even discuss, imagine, because everything must be calculated specifically, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will do this time, we will take decisions on how to answer that question.
It won't be related to a knock on the door, any false attempts, the Minister emphasized.
We will, first of all, withdraw from our interests, the interests of protecting our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business, and the conclusions of our partners on their adaptability, treaty and reliability.
As a result of the steps taken in the area of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what partners are getting - the head of the MDR continued.
If they say in all voice, "they will also be sick for us, but we have to go to Russia to punish," that is probably not enough."
With regard to the WTO's exit from the FF in response to possible new sanctions, there is no.
On the contrary, we want to strengthen the WTO instrument, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already launched this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia has been accused of dumping and has been subjected to anti-dumping measures against the RF economies.
"To help us prepare WTO mechanisms and to stop our position on the inability to apply the EU's third energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How can you make the best use of cheese in the garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since post-revelation cheese loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to raise it together with other artists.
It's a great combination of many cultures.
Because a few cheeses can and should be planted both at other times and at the same time, ornamental plants.
Another addition to cheese is that it provides a mass of creative opportunities.
You can shape it into a tree of different heights, a better coast, a coast with a broad basis, and even a garden buns, a tree with a magnificently decorated creature.
Just choose that shape that's more consistent with the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a resident of the Leningrad area was sentenced to the death of false money
According to the Republican MVD, the man was involved in his criminal activity in the Olonec and Segegej districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in inheriting the Volo Year area, where he was sentenced to two and a half years of deprivation of liberty this year.
Later, the man stood before the Olonec District Court.
And for the end of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segejo.
In the investigation, wines have been shown to be obtained from several episodes of cash flow related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of this year, criminal proceedings were brought before the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the term of deprivation of liberty for four years with the term of office in the general regime.
The sentence did not enter into force lawfully.
Remember, for the past week, two other counterfeit money earners were sentenced to pay in Peter’s warehouses.
Azerbaijani citizens also arrived in Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them lost his freedom for five years, another for four years.
Each is assigned a fine of 500 thousand rubles.
Nor has the sentence entered into force by law.
The 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first "Dervish" in Arhangelska
The Mitting, which was located in the center of the area, was for the first Arctic war.
Dervish provided military assistance to the SRS from the United States and Great Britain.
In the Archangelic Mitting Memorial, a memorial was held in the castle of the future memory of the participants of the northern carriages, located on the coastal name of Sedova in Solombal.
The representatives of the Veteran organizations of Arhangelska, children from the academic class, gathered.
We first met twenty-three years ago when a stone was placed.
But today's event is also not a holiday, but a day to remember those who have not returned to the sea," noted the president of the North Sea Railway Council of Boris Carpov.
Then the city’s spirit orchestra was presented, and the academics of the academic classes gave flowers to the veterans and marched with the Russian flag and the name of the winner.
Mitting's done with the paint on the wall.
The vessel itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transporter loaded with strategic raw material (10 000 tonnes of rubber, 1,500 tonnes of shaped boots, oil, cheese and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, there were 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines on board the ships, and 15 Harrickins, in an understandable position.
At the same time, 16 WMF vessels were made up of British Air Force vessels, of which two aircraft were aircraft.
Karavan was not identified as an opponent and had successfully arrived at a point of appointment - Arghälska.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital craft operations, 126 vessels and about 50 military vessels were killed.

A very American idea that labour rights are human rights
The Congressmen of Kit Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill for which the trade union organization was protected as a civil law.
"Where the trade unions, there and the workplaces of the middle class," says Ellison, a democracy from Minnesota, who is co-chaired by the Congress of the Progressive Group.
That is why I am proud to present the Act on the extension of the rights of workers together with the symbol of the movement of civil rights by John Luis.
This innovative bill provides workers with the same legal opportunities in the discrimination of trade union organizations, and in other forms of discrimination, with the remaining strength of trade unions
Amendments to the Labour Relations Act to enable workers who are discriminated against to participate in trade unions, seek justice in civil courts, and receive compensation for damages and tax payments - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least, according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to discuss what Ellisson, Luis and the sponsors of the bill are to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks by the professions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country, Americans have sometimes supported the countries of the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
It was time for millions of Americans to remember when that country was at the same time protecting democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of print and the right to an organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Todze's armed author was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that acknowledged that "the right of workers to organize, negotiate and collective action is guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General David Eisenhauer and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article which stated openly: "To develop associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and every profession or area of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to undermine this right will not have legal power; measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as unlawful.
When Eleanor Rusvelt, former President of the International Commission on Human Rights, was the President of the World Declaration on Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Rusvellt and his representatives included the assurance that “each has the right to organize and enter a trade union to protect his interests”.
Native Americans have adopted the basic rule that labour rights are human rights.
When that country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organise trade unions - and that the union to participate as a equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government agencies - must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that workers should have the right to organize and to be heard in a free and open society.
Like Martin Luther King of Youth said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not weakened the strength of the nation but has increased them.
The lower living standards of millions, the trade unions have created a great deal of markets for industry and have raised the entire nation to an unprecedented level of production.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history will remember them.
History reminds us of how we should act.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the expansion of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions has long been seen.
Kit Ellison and John Lewis are reborn the ideals that have historically expanded America and made a democratic promise.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could close all the abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, the federal judge temporarily blocked the entry into force of the Law of Louisiana, which his party said would close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Ginadlom in June and should enter into force on 1 September, doctors who are abortions would be required to have the authority to receive patients in the hospital 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to make legal abortions by continuing to seek such authority.
“The trainees will be allowed to work legally and continue to exercise their powers,” wrote Judge John de Gravells in his decision.
The hearing will be held within a month when the judge will make a more permanent decision on this law.
The defenders of the right to abortion were happy to meet this decision, last of all against similar measures, saying that this would give doctors more time to gain medical authority.
"Today's decision ensures that women in Louisiana will be protected from a funeral law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Norpat, president and director of the Reproductive Rights Centre, who asked for the termination of the Act by three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision was made to doctors from two clinics who did not speak out on the matter and also made a statement of approval.
Louisiana is part of 11 states that have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently recognized such measures as non-institutional measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in that state, were blocked by federal judges on Friday.
The rights of abortion, together with the American College of Doctors and gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, are said to be subject to medical restrictions that are not necessary from the point of view of medicine.
Abstainers claim that such measures are aimed at protecting the health of women, although some have also noted their positive effect on the closure of the clinic.
Only one doctor who had an abortion in Louisiana had the authority to take the hospital informed the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all the remaining doctors in the state had to stop the procedure, the doctor, fearing his safety, would have to stop the procedure, the group reported.
Criticizing this decision, the officials of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors who had abortions until their statements had been made.
What would lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products?
At least half of the products in each type of goods in the commercial networks should be Russian production, according to Oleg Nilov, a representative of the Gosdumas of the Russian Orthodox Group.
The Parliamentary prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, which was written in the News newspaper.
The document will still be detailed in order to avoid possible distortions to buyers.
According to the remaining groups of products produced in Russia, the Ritillar will have to provide at least half of its crop to indigenous producers," Nilov said.
Along with amendments to the article “On the basis of public business regulation in the RFB”, the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code setting down the VAT rate by 10 per cent in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota in trade networks is part of a package of incentives for Russian producers.
There will be more and more household goods on the docks.
However, the initiative may have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the counsel of the company Nalogovic, a member of the independent expert centre of the Public Duma, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy and for the indigenous agricultural and food sectors, will have a positive effect and will lead to growth.
In addition, there will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, and that means the income will grow.
They will also have the right to dictate their conditions and prices, since they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to scale their activities and sales, resulting in higher taxes than before.
This will increase the revenue of the budget, create new jobs, which some industries will start to expand, and which will soon be reimbursed, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will be reduced several times, indeed, not immediately," the expert noted.
In the past, Russian companies were often unable to access local stores because of high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the bomb was introduced, it was released and can be lifted with relief.
It should be remembered, however, that after all the necessary agreements and health checks on the Russian market, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be produced.
In other words, it's now time to relax, when the old games have gone, and the new ones haven't arrived yet.
Almost a month later, it could be said of an increase in demand for domestic goods, as well as an increase in prices for finished production," said AIF.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian public organization, "Russian Financial Directors' Club", i.e. Tamara Kasyanov.
Similarly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will strengthen the sector for local producers.
In that case, they will compete with each other rather than with the goods that are subject to the subsidies of another State.
In other words, the fight against the buyer is spread between companies working under the same sector laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanov notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of the participants not far from all the articles.
In this situation, trade networks have to "cut down" the share of Russian goods to half the assortment.
As a result, there are growing fears that inappropriate goods will be placed on the docks.
It is possible that foreign products will be placed in Russia with deleted labels," the expert adds.
The negative impact of the quota introduction is felt by large trading networks, particularly those that are more useful to cooperating with importers.
It is logical that, in such a schedule, foreign suppliers themselves suffer because demand for their production is reduced.
Lithuania does not exclude that the quota law on domestic goods can also affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian products may be available as imported analogues, while stores can attract prices to the second, such as the defective goods.
By the beginning of 2000, the idea of imports had been renewed by the economists in February this year because of the continued exploitation of the rubles.
The issue of withdrawal from import products is now becoming even more relevant in the light of the lack of relations with the West.
The Act calls for the obligation of suppliers to be considered by domestic producers when making orders.
Then we will go much faster and more confident on the way to import, and the production planning system will be established in a shorter time," said Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for agricultural sectors with high potential, for example, in the milk sector, where the proportion of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the reach of Russian stores.
In addition, strong pulses can also produce meat.
As is known, the largest proportion of imports remain per capita - from 30% to 35%.
It is obtained that 65-70 per cent of Russia's production is still coming."
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quota to domestic products facilitates imports and can accelerate this process.
However, the initiative itself does not lead to the introduction of this initiative, since it requires a set of measures, confirmed by Lithuania.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may be imported from the border, i.e. full import will not occur, but substantial steps will be taken to that end.
At the same time, quotas must still be established in the country for the production of domestic products in order to meet those quotas.
These quotas are such guarantees and will provide such guarantees," the expert concludes.
Immediate diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that the cancer in rural areas is increasing.
Angelina Jolly and her brother James published a video that remembered their peaceful mother, who died from the hands of the sharks in 2007.
Women who live in rural Australia face a higher risk of death than those who live in cities.
Researchers analyzed the map of more than 1100 Australian women with the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that 35 per cent lived five years after diagnosis.
Chief researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute for Medical Studies QIMR Berghofer reported that the likelihood of death in the study was 20 per cent higher than in the regions and remote parts of the state than in the urban areas.
FURTHER INFORMATION: New medicines can slow the cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the liver
The researchers followed the medical path of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of the diagnosis, the type of cancer, current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the risk of survival.
Women older and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote parts of the country, the likelihood of death during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from the hands of rats, Dr. Jordan suggested that there was an unsustainable diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and they are mainly in major cities," she said.
Despite increasing the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would allow women to be treated near home and support programmes for people who have been treated far from home could be helpful.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that long-term life among women with cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young woman from the Gold Coast, Elisha Niv, said that she had a aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
A new FAP door will be opened in September in the Kuzener region
The construction of the medical establishment in Toktavalek village began in April of that year and was based on a typical project.
The value of the work amounted to about 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information, the financing of the construction of the project was carried out through the Republican budget under the local investment programme.
The overall area of the medical and preventive institution is almost 230 square metres.
This will provide medical assistance to the population of eight population points: the villages of Toktibelak and the village of Dementievo, Puncherumal, Tunia, Fomichi, Toribelek, Shinur and Chascaël.
The new Feldshire-Cosher post will replace the existing FAP building, which was built in 1918 and has long spent its resources, and its premises do not meet the health and hygiene requirements.
The new agency will be opened in the near future.
The murder of a four-month-old son in the state of New York City will be brought before the court
The Chuvashii apartment is on the ground of suspects who have been convicted of murdering their own child.
A criminal investigation was carried out in Chebeksarak with respect to the 31-year-old population of Novočeboksarska, accused of the cause of the death of the carelessness.

In time, a woman fell asleep on her son, and as a result, he fell asleep.
Criminal case, informs the press office of the S.C.C.R. in Chuvashi, sent to court.
Inflation came out of the drop.
Do they feel that they are growing up at a high price?
As a result of the cross-border sanctions of the FIF and the West, inflation in Russia will be accelerated and will not be predicted by the authorities, which are convinced by the analysis of WTB Capital.
According to experts, the effects of the anti-sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, wrote the BBC Daily.
According to the latest Minécono-Development Project, inflation in 2014 is 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in the following year and less than 6.5 per cent in 2014.
However, according to the Commersant newspaper, this week the MER should introduce "small but basic" corrections in the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the government could lower inflation by 2015, which would eliminate the expected inflation of population income.
It was predicted that the food sanctions of the RFF would be applied year-to-August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be expected?
The current situation is a shock, but the downward trend in inflation is not going to change," said the newspaper source in Minfin.
Economies from the Capital VAT do not share the expectations of the government's financial and economic block on inflation and predict price growth in 2014 at a level of 8 per cent.
The main effect of the prohibitions will be accompanied by the possible introduction of a sales tax (NSP) in 2015 by experts.
The inflation rate is 9% higher than in February, after years of price increases fall, experts believe.
In fact, last week, Rostat introduced the first inflation results after the FF introduced "accuracy sanctions".
AIF.ru examined the experts and explained their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of FC AForex Analysis Department:
The price growth has already been observed on the main segments of goods.
In addition, when social goods were transported, the Government had to launch measures to monitor the system of price stability in order to prevent the risks of undue price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and regulators are already accountable on a daily basis to the regulatory authorities so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason, initiates price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal pace of the capital flow, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, the internal conversion due to the refugees in foreign currency, and the embargo on imports of food products from countries associated with sanctions against Russia.
If inflation pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum product collection would not be reduced to 12 per cent by one quarter.
The ban on the import of food products caused the shock of the proposal on the internal market and led to a completely logical increase in the final cost.
As we cannot fully implement the import arrangements at the current stage and increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to pose a risk to inflation.
If there are further physical causes related to lack of confidence in national currency, as well as broken prospects for economic growth, inflation may be above 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Zuvaev, Director of the Department of Analysis of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent in the month, and in the zero, it was also higher, another case, which was then compensated for rapid economic growth.
I think inflation is 8-8.5 per cent over the year.
Platon Maguta, managing the assets of the U.K. Fund Maguta
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still being successfully halted, but if further pressure is intensified, especially in the financial sector, it can lead to some difficulties and increase the inflational expectations of the people who are traditionally in purchasing sufficient currency to protect their savings.
It may be suggested that the Government, the CFF and the Ministry of Finance are trying to mitigate the smooth smoothing of the rubles, both by market methods and by public regulation.
But the price growth begins traditionally after spring and may become more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is 7,5 per cent, most recently, as the IMF still has financial savings.
Farming centres are forced to reduce the number of households
Such a fall, resulting in an exceptional decrease in the number of households under 35 years of age, could lead to the loss of 10 million pounds per year when young consumers today reach the "main age of farming", according to HTA, reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, residents spend 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on farming.
It refers to an increase in the number of people living in high-urbaned areas without crops, the popularity of gardening in front of the house for parking and the reduction of garden size as other factors that pose a threat to the industry, the annual sales estimated at £5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of households fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest price for household goods in Britain is lower.
HTA and the Royal Farming Society reported that the rent of housing and the absence of land did not mean that people could not grow up.
Guy Barter, Chief Agriculture Adviser in the RHS, said: "The growth of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden century” of the different trade in agricultural products as a result of an increase in the number of households and economic growth from the end of the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve in this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.

Turkey calls on the American Diplomat to report on spying
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey drew up the highest level of American diplomat in the country for explanations regarding the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Under Prime Minister Bullent reported that the United States trusted in cases and Turkish officials discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that the documents provided by the former National Security Agency analysis by Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority research facility for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan had ignored the importance of this communication, saying that all leading countries were spying on each other.
Earlier, it was reported that the main intelligence agency of Germany had also made Ankara an investigation, causing a more angry response to the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies were united against Alibaba
China's largest companies in China are the Dalian Wanda Group and the Internet giant Tencent Holdings (scsets, missionaries, etc.) and Badu (the largest Chinese search) that will compete on the online trade market with Aliba.
However, the wonders of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American opponents, eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Largest Union
The companies plan to invest 5 billion June ($814 million), 70 per cent of which will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent of each of the online companies, says Wanda Group.
The company's registration is planned in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine the search services of Badu with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest resort in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to the network of 40 fishing villages, the Wanda Group manages as a minimum of 49 commercial inevitability facilities throughout China and 40 commercial centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a cinema and thematic entertainment park in Cindao (a town in eastern China on the Iron Sea coast).
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring income at the level of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda belongs to the American AMC Entertainment Holdings film network, which makes the company the world's largest film player.
As of 2015, Wanda plans to provide all its trading centres, clothing and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which are used as a time-contest for Aliba.
According to Dun Cé, which will lead a new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million in the next year.
The new platform should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dun Cé.
The content of online-to-offline (O2O) is to attract buyers on the Internet in order to come to normal offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is services for the sale of coupons of the species Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "perog" in online commerce," said Wanda Van Xianjlinn (the title of Bloomberg).
"The present area of O2O in China does not exist now, and in this situation the chances are almost equal," he believes.
The Chinese Internet Trade Market is the largest in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., it will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users grew to 632 million, resulting in Bloomberg's official statistics: this is more than any country of the world except India.
And it is estimated that by 2015 this figure could grow to 850 million people.
The Treasurer’s Union
The head of Tencent Ma Huatan has been the richest man in China for a long time, but according to the millions of Bloomberg agencies' index, the founder of Aliba Jack Ma has already earned it at $5.5 billion.
The status of Jack Ma is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes to his share in Aliba.
The leader of Badu Robin Li is now taking a third place among the richest people of China, while Van Xianjlin from Wanda is the fourth queen.
"It is very interesting to observe this battle: three of the richest men are united to challenge the more rich," said Bloomberg, director of the China Centre for Electronic Commerce Research at Hanchjoo Cao Lee.
But he believes that the new company will not be able to fully compete with Alibaba immediately after the creation of "Rome can't be built in one day".
The fact that Aliba is not only opposed to new companies but also to world trade leaders is evidence of the pressure to report on the financial indicators of Aliba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something medium between eBay and Amazon.com, but since June, the Chinese company has worked more than both of its American competitors together.
The net profit of Alibaba over the period almost twice exceeds the same amount of competitors - it increased almost three times a year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has great potential for money generation, thanks to its mobile apps," Bloomberg commented on an analysis from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated prospect of Alibaba, on the United States Commission's website, the number of active mobile users of the company in July amounted to 188 million, significantly higher than the March index (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter came to mobile devices.
Alibaba should be referred to as the value of its shares before IPO.
According to the average assessment of 11 analyses published by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to the Bloomberg sources, Aliba's dispute at the New York Foundation (NYSE) could be settled on 16 September.
Road-show companies before this event will start on 3 September.
It is expected that Alibaba's exit to IPO will be recorded in the history of NYSE and will allow companies to attract around $20 billion.
To date, a record of the amount of funds spent on the United States exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 provided the initial deployment of its shares, amounting to $17.9 billion.
At least half of food items in the trade networks should be Russian production, the Lord's delegates consider.
They have drawn up a draft law on this subject.
This is the subject of amendments to paragraph 8 of the FC “On the basis of public governance of trade in the FFR” and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important explanation, according to the bill, must be at least 50 per cent of the products produced by domestic production in stores in each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as fruit and fruit of olives, so they will be made "scad" to avoid possible discoports for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law is amended in the RDF Tax Code, which lays down a 10 per cent decline in the rate of NDS in the implementation of all food products originating in Russia, reports the News newspaper.
On 27 August, a draft amendment Act was introduced in the Lower House of Parliament to the O-District Markets, which proposes to restore agricultural markets in Russia to which small producers can implement their products.
Chief of the Magaluf police charged with corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence of police and police demands from the municipality of Kalvi in the State Prosecutor's Office of Malorki on Friday.
The chief of the Kalvii police on the Kurt island of Malorca was arrested as a result of charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in a well-known centre of the Magalufe ' s infamous drinking.
The chief inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained because of the charges of corruption brought against him by several businessmen with Punta Ballena, on the street where most of the bars and night clubs of Magalufa were located.
According to the daily online release of Mallorca Diario, the guests provided evidence of demand by the police and police officials of the municipality of Calvia at the Malorca Office for Combating Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the National Guard of Spain on charges of corruption and will be tried by a judge with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that insufficient night club owners said that protectionism by the authorities had a serious impact on their business status.
"There's nothing more to earn money, it's to survive," said one of the businessmen.
We cannot endanger our source of existence.
We're gonna lose something.
Magaluf fell into the headline of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British breather who met 24 men in a bar escape.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop the inexhaustible occupation of the rest of Magalufas, bringing at least the number of well-known alcoholics away from the bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where an incident occurred with a minet, was forced to close for the year, while the Playhouse and Carnage Bar Associations were jointly outtraced at €55,000 ($73000).
The Magaluf tourist resort, mainly popular among young British breathers, was also a place of many unfortunate cases of alcohol abuse, known as "balconing", when people were attracted to one balcony on another or to a balcony in a guest pool.
The first day is marked by mild and winding conditions affecting aircraft at Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise for South Australia, bringing rain showers and strong winds that had an impact on the flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by night at 9 a.m., after 6:6 mm, which came out after the night of the resurrection.
The last rain caused a couple of short-distance lemons with a broken wind, including a gas that started shortly before 8 evenings and wiped out almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter released an early spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The fragile conditions are expected to have served as one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
Samuel had to land on the map immediately after 7:30 a.m., but fell into the atmosphere of the wind - a sudden change in speed or the direction of the wind in a short distance - and was forced to take the height.
Air pollution reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
These flights showed that the plane had to be lifted during the second landing, and the plane finally landed about 8:40 a.m.
The delay in the journey led to the subsequent delay of several other voyages, including the Emirates route from Dubai and the Kantas route from Sydney.
The maximum 16C is predicted in Adelacide on Tuesday, likely one or two lemons.
Recosting of building facilities in the RFF will take place
The issue of pricing, the management of the construction industry and the integration of the federal anti-immopolation service networks are under special control.
An expert competition development council was established in the field of construction in the FAS.
At its meeting, the Head of Control of the Control of HIV, Construction and Natural Resources FAS Vadim Solovev stated that “the current calculation of construction facilities is absolutely incalculable”.
The normative basis makes prices unexplained and may lead to unreasonable construction prices, considered by the FAS.
It is also proposed that the construction of properties at the design stage should be determined on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions rather than the current accounting standards and unit assessments of technological operations.
These proposals are presented in the "road map" and are now under the Minister's review.
" The replacement of traditional accounting documents in construction of structural elements should lead to reduced corruption in the industry, " UGB" explained Vadim Solovev.
Now, each ball and wheel is considered in question, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, poor construction companies can hide "the whole tractor".
The Ministry agreed with the FAS.
"The first cost-sharing effort on structural elements has already been: a cost-effective methodology has been developed for constructive decision-making, an estimate on these indicators, and the head of the department of urban activities and architecture of Minister Elena Jukova.
As a pilot, the road construction area was chosen.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As Antonio Dejanco, head of the RGB, told by Antonio Dejanco, has long been old-fashioned, but the other business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
“As for the proposed calculations on structural elements, it is difficult to achieve this in practice, as buildings are often used in the construction of buildings in a completely different manner,” he believes.
It's not a secret that the strip market is developing in a lot of ways thanks to the hospitality.
In the view of the President of the Government of the NP, Ekaterina Lezina, the Expert Professional Community, the State is now the most procurator.
The Deputy Director of the Industrial Capital Building Centre of Rosatom Vladimir Malahov drew attention to the fact that today the market is specifically divided into companies that have access to the contract portfolio, and to companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competition in this field.
He considered that the creation of a transparent market could be possible only if the access to contracts would be limited to an impact management.
The Expert Council was invited to draw up a housing system in such a way that the same executive would not have the right to receive more than 1 billion rubs or more than 1 billion rubs.
The Minister believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of business impact as well as the effectiveness of building management.
As Elena Jukova explained, it would be necessary to assign the employer to the gender-based functions, which would increase the number of contractors and budgets on its content.
In doing so, the contracting authority should have knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the competent organizations as well as their safety.
It will often be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the overall safety of the facility.
In addition, this approach could attract high-qualified buyers due to the lack of interest in obtaining a public order on a low level of work and a small amount of contract.
The headquarters of the expert advisory centre of the Institute for the Procurement of Alexander Evstaschenkov is of the view that the hosting procedure has now turned into a business game to the attention of the contractor.
And the example was: "A party should indicate "specific indicators" without the words "or equivalent", "to", "to", "more", "more", "alog", "or", "type", "a similar type", "no less", "more", "may", "may have", "maybe", "before", "not earlier", "not earlier", "not later", etc.
In this way, employers often misuse their right to establish requirements for the content of an application submitted by organizations.
Another issue of 44-FZ, Evstashenko's view, was that it was necessary to assess the quality of the application through the "bumbling" proposal of the participant.
In considering the request of the participant, it is indeed possible to assess only the qualification of the contractor but not the quality of the work that has not yet been implemented, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can be assessed only when it is accepted.
The Expert Council was also invited to transfer the marginal income from the top to the lower corner to remove intermediate contractors.
The President of the Expert Council, the Secretary-General, the co-chair of the FAS, Andrey Carykovsky, believes that this should not be done, as a woman should be responsible for her order.
Otherwise, it will be found in the famous Recycling of the Archdiocese of Atel: "Do the prags claim?".
Israeli children return to school after war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories around the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after they spent the summer in bombers, when rockets and mines fell to their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip were closed when the territory was restored after the war.
The beginning of school activities brought joy and excitement to those who suffered from the rockets of the inhabitants of southern Israel, but the results of the war remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the children's garden staff, Pashcho, who dropped the rocket, took the tracks from the walls and children's doors before the disciples arrived.
"We're a little afraid, but we're happy to see the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibuz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a balanced life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that her partner started going to school "very strange" again.
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't all leave our homes," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a cube located near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement continued in the past week, thousands of border residents, such as Saad, did not go out on the street or left their homes, fled to safer areas from the Gaza Strip to escape from a rocket fire and a minor fire.
Many of the residents of Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, are suspicious of their need to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about half of the families had not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at the time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanijau visited the school in Sderote, a city on the border with Gaza, which had made a strong effort to recover from the Palestinian fire.
He said to his children, "We are doing our best to give you knowledge and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to a lasting peace last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement was quickly concluded with the end of the war, but key questions remained, such as Hamas' request for the removal of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and ports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to put on a weapon and bring back the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who were killed in battle.
The new stage of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, of whom three were peaceful citizens, and at least 494 children were assessed by the Palestinian side and by the United Nations.
Israel disagrees with these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were combatants; however, it did not provide substantial evidence supporting that claim.
The Israeli side lost 66 soldiers and six peaceful people, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4591 rockets and mines on Israeli cities, mainly in the southern part of the country.
The Israeli army then had more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes were damaged and destroyed in the Gaza Strip, and it is estimated that 250,000 people were displaced in more than 100 schools that were converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters, and fear continued, education officials stopped the beginning of the school week last week.
"I hope that school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education as children of all the world and Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criteria, the prices for real estate have shown the largest winter growth in seven years.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices increased by 1.1 per cent in the Australian capital in August, the RP data reported on Monday.
This growth has resulted in a total increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice the increase in 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not distributed equally throughout the country.
RP Data Tim Loules reported that Sydney and Melbourne were leading a double market.
RP Data figures show that the housing prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent over the last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following market power was Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where prices grew from five to six per cent.
On the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government spending was reduced by 1.4 per cent a year.
Mr. Loules said that now, when it began to rain, there would be an increase in the number of non-movable objects on sale over the next few months, which would be a "current test" for the market.
"In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and current conditions with a low rate of interest, it is likely that the cost of living will still grow within the next three months," he said.
How People Live in the Old Home of Uf
In the former house of gold industry and mountaineer Evdokima and his son Ivan Demidova on the streets of October 57/1 (formerly the Great Kazakhstan) 18 rooms.
The 18th - century house of the building did not change in its practicality unless it was seen as windfall.
Foreigners go here as they go, and the residents suffer more than they enjoy, from their privilege - the right to live in an old ufim house, which is remembered by Colonel Alexander Suvarov.
The building date is incorrect, history indicates two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it is found that the building was not less than 300 years old.
The old door, always open the door, scraping the kitchen.
The doors in the rooms were placed close to each other, the walls were torn apart, and a street was seen in the light of the crowded studs.
Everything seems to be in the right word.
The people of the town say, "You don't think that's true."
Living in a 18th - century wooden house is very difficult - says Tatiana Lukajana, resident of the apartment No. 3.
The object is on the horizon, but the money on it is not given for ten years, but we feel like museum exponsors who just forgot about it.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still self-sufficient, but the foundation is broken.
Many people still go to the toilet on the street and spend a week in public bathrooms.
How can we be content under such circumstances?
The road goes directly below the windows, even the walking area.
Tiana's gonna take care of the burden.
It is now seen that it was only a matter of hearing: cars flowed under the windows.
Look, the glass is always moving, we can't open the window, but the noise is normal.
The human being is accustomed to doing good and evil.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to the husband, hands are gold.
More than that, we have two rooms, we live the next day with our son.
In other families, conditions are much worse, and the second is about a half feet high.
To contrast, Tatian offers to visit a neighbor from the apartment No. 6 of the Oldestine.
A pleasant guest woman with a cup of coffee offers a cup of coffee and has a hard drink to tell:
We have a single room, 14.5 m2 on four people, and we live with a man and a daughter with a grandson.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another place in the living room -- the people have a room's eyes: the antresols, two ghosts of the letter "g"; one of them has a grandson with a laptop.
It's very close and it's a little different from the usual parental interest: just a beautiful, "historic."
However, the flow is regular: the water supply system is never expected.
People talk about their apartment at the same time as Italian, whose home is in Roman ruins.
This is reflected in one very old and recent, daily and legendary:
The Flood occurred about 40 years ago in the time of the last repair.
Then they made us a little kitchen in a kitchen and a toilet out of an old hole.
We live as once in a place where Damid and his family live on the second floor of the house.
Our apartment isn't privatized, is it?
In the Uf's Non-Muslim Centre, privatization does not matter.
All we get is a single room, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to leave, but no further promises were made.
I'm not used to complaining and I'm not going to.
In this room (room!) there was a whole Dynasty: my grandmother with a grandmother, my mother with a father, my husband and my daughter with a grandmother.
It was all about this time.
For example, the health crisis ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flag, they're the metro tunnel!
They say, the solution has been mixed up on eggs, so it's been a long time.
The house is built on the ground, thanks to Damid!
Probably that's why no one's killed the wounded man or his own.
Only the building just slowly dies in our eyes: the roofs and the graveyards are burned, the fields are repeatedly broken, we are in the cement, but everything is useless - the solution is in the ground like a refrigerator.
They say, yes, under our quiet lake and on the White River, which were especially made by the old people here, so that they could be covered by danger, in case of something.
They've been chased.
The old man told him how some history came to him, he managed to let him go into the apartment.
Then he decided to give them shelter in exchange for his agreement on October.
People have rejected history:
Where are we in the uniform?
And there's a little bit of hope here that's going to give you more room.
We agreed to exchange that we would never win.
In addition, the Oldest's family didn't win anything.
The biggest dream of the people is that they will be scattered, and the girl from the 16-year-old grandson gave a separate room.
There are two families who have set up a two - room apartment instead of the most beautiful ruins in which two generations are now living.
A sympathical, miniature girl, Olise Karsakova, from the room No. 11 and 12, shows the second house.
It is home to a large family in two densely populated areas of the total area of 23 m2.
We're all seven people, two children.
See for yourself what conditions.
The kitchen is covered with kitchenettes, as well as ovens, in kitchen walls, and in rooms.
The water in the end of the year is only cold.
As we walked through the rooms of Uf's very old house, we can be sure that most of them were married to Lavrent's wife, No. 4.
They operate the most spacious rooms in the first phase.
You're right, many places!
A 75 square apartment, a three-person apartment.
We live as once in the rooms where Suvarov remained on the legend during his stay in Ufe, says family head Alexander Dmitrievic Lavrentev.
It's too high, it's too high.
One bad thing is all around the third floor, it's broken, it's broken.
Neighbors, I think they've already told you!
Most of the tortures we have with the fields: the wooden roofs have been lifted, the earth has literally fallen out of the foot.
I've put my back on, kid; there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room, we're walking like we're riding on horses, so shitty.
The house of the buyer, Edokima Demidov, Alexander Dmitrievic, can tell you more about any tour guide.
The gold industry is like a family, talking about it with a resurrection.
In fact, the identity was undisputed: the Kagin and Uzian holdings built a house, fired guns and cholera, held the Ural miners.
The descendants of the purchasing inviolability are proud, but they no longer want to live under one cross with history.
I've been living here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitriewich.
There were then wooden spaces for carrots, horses and carols, which were then destroyed.
In 1968 they wanted to take our house away, but something went wrong...
History has been repeated in 2014: new dwellings have been relocated.
We, as a team, have collected all the documents, gathered the necessary facilities, and learned that the move to the apartment will take place in 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in in all this...
Two years ago, Lavrentev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Austria to learn about the fate of the house.
The tenants didn't accept.
They sent from one table to the other, and then, as a smile, they released a brochure without signature and printed: "The Ministry of Culture does not oppose the spread of residents."
I even felt that our house was no longer in the area of the city, since it was under number 57, then it was 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like they got it back in the '70s.
The Russian planet has been referred to the information-analytical sector of the Department of Land Management of the Uf of Vladimir Barabaš.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the housing distribution programme.
I can't take responsibility for the actions of the 70s, but I know that there was a plan for the well-being of all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, but the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses on the streets of the October Revolution, which represent the value of architecture, was successful.
In a short time, people are planning to travel to new rooms.
According to Barabash, the restoration of Dom Demidov would be by Italian specialists who participated in the reconstruction of the buildings in Venice.
The project " Old Ufa" is currently under construction in Italy and is being presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016, the entire old old Gazan street will be restored, says the official.
The house will acquire an appropriate type, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The house of Demidov will soon become a museum open to all who wish.
In addition, at the Government level, it was decided to make a trip on the day of departure.
Unfortunately, there will not be too much load of roads in the city.
The arrival of people from the future museum of Vladimir Barabash is promised in 2015.
On the other hand, they are almost as comfortable as they are now. Their new rooms will be the same area as the current one.
It's just another time.
A forest fire started in Primorje because of the money.
The drought became a result of a forest fire in the Ohotonchi village forest area in the Premor region.
There is an increase in the number of forces and funds.
According to the guidance of the KGSB, the Premier Air Force, the conditions created at the site of fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Air Force Chief:
The fire, which occurred in a difficult position, found a medical observer on the Ana-2 patrol aircraft on the 3 hectares.
They burn the old wastes on an old fuel tank.
The gravity of the territory and the crucifixy is more than 45 degrees, and the lack of suitable for the lifting of fire extinguishers creates significant difficulties in washing.
We need Mi-8.
It was very difficult to deliver the forces in charge of the Mi-2 and An-2 aircraft.
After the fire was discovered at the site of the shower, four fire extinguishers were promptly raised.
The main task of experts is to set fires and prepare a platform for the delivery of additional power and fuel.
In the eating area, 3 fire extinguishers were supplied by helicopters in the village of Ohotonica.
As soon as the helicopter is ready to land in the fire zone, the specialists will be transferred to the site of washing, the Homeland Administration website will be reported.
Lenny Henry: My father never kissed me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica, Dawley, in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry repeats the video, Rudy's Red Plastics, which is partly based on visual conversations with his father and has grown out of a series of broadcasts on Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of gold and copper, and the melons are life-threatening.
However, Henry had to undergo some difficult memories of the child.
After his mother died there was a lot of treatment, and Henry often thought about his relationship with his father.
He was very unavailable.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice saying, "You're supposed to be funny.
Stay away from your sister.
Fuck you!
I want to see the cricket.
My older brothers Seymur and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a child, went to the pope and talked about such things as the form of a beer, the beauty of the cracks.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such a cute guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Before long, Henry discovered a lithium master at Dawley, and although the conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to look at what his life should have been.
Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, dingy, deep labyrinths of fire and smoke and dogs.
My father walked into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard how he slowly started to ask about himself because he wanted to get away from a lithium master.
When I came there, I realized that he had done this for years and years to hire us for food, and I began to appreciate it more.
Nevertheless, Henry grew out of a child’s lack of parental love.
My father never slept, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got bad at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his daughter, Billy, by Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he had not adopted as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop bothering me!
Dad, I got 22!
Don Frank.
Why don't I get along with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still excellent friends with France, where he was married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I have Don with me?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very, very, very, and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I began to take a serious interest in fitness, and I also had a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very heavy.
And that's sweet.
No one's dark.
The change in Henry's career trajectory may have been reflected in his noble, short-sighted fight.
From the time he received the recognition of criticism for his Otello, he was completely enthralled in the theater.
She followed the Comedy Mistake, and then Augusta Wilson.
This work is different from the seats and comedians that have been an inexhaustible attribute of his busy professional life.
He started a career when he was 16 and worked at a factory.
Didy noticed how he paraded on the stage and wrote about it in "New Persons."
His career on television began in the mid-seventies: "For a long time I was the only blacksmith on television."
He learned to work.
Not only did I have to raise my eyes in the audience, I had to learn to be an effective search engine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and that was very difficult.
Lenni in "New Persons" in 1975
As his manager had the right to the Black and White Display, a light entertainment program in which people have "birthed themselves", Henry found out that it has been in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of want it never to be with me, but I don't regret what he did.
Although it was a strange, dignified position, I worked in big fields and learned to work with the dust.
But what was “the most prized was a simple entertainment classic on British television for years and years”, and it was also a “grotetic parody for black people”.
In the presence of individuals who were also exposed to the culture of black people in Great Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedian project in the eighth century.
The first season of Shaw Lenny Henry was transferred in 1984, and in the ninth century he was known as, among other things, chief poet Gerett Blacklock from the comedy series "Shef!".
Advertisements, documentary films, TV shows and movies have taken his life for the next ten years, but after his series on BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What you're going to do next, Len, because it's a little bit like you're wasting your time or you're messing around."
There was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had this allergy in Shakespeare.
I can't say that I've learned so much at school, and I thought it was, in a lot, an honor to the white people of the middle class with the knees and the shoes down the front.
So I was so scared of him.
Everyone we interviewed for transfer, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't push it until you know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of those words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry spent 20 dollars from the last Otello monologue for the document transfer, and he got caught.
I felt like I could do this.
Anyway, my head was fixed.
"As such, it is a serious matter, in this case, to study your text, to conduct a small study.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this song five months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
It's said they were waiting for disasters, and she didn't happen.
We've just started the Code of Mistakes.
I went to the National Theatre immediately, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
It was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
A technical disability occurred, and Henry felt instinctively that his case was to entertain the public.
"The voice inside me said, "You have to work 10 minutes while they make a computer."
Instead, the Assistant Director announced that the presentation would be repeated as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went out of the stage and something said to me, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else talk about it.
"You're playing in song, stay in role."
Henry at the "School" at the Daches Theatre.
It was hard to study the text for the Selection.
Panic is good enough, it strengthens the muscle.
And she accepted it, so it was like a sign from above, saying, "What do you have to do with it?"
He says it, of course, with a loud voice.
So I'll keep it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the dining room.
In fact, Henry still has the idea of a comedy -- all the way through, he's going to break up his nose when he does it, he's going to end it.
I just decided not to work in a stand, because this piece of shit with the revenge of the whole room of strangers, I think it's dangerous enough.
If you're always trying to do this, it can lead to a trap.
I'm sometimes working in the "Direct Effer in Apollo" whenever I want, but basically, I don't get the satisfaction I used to.
I'm wondering if he's got a tour of Standapa ever since.
The pleasure of sitting in the room with the director, who can give you the form of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give up.
Is that his new crew?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You're always telling a story, and here's a great place to do.
I love history.
People like stories.
Kenya registers public officials to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya has begun a biometric registration of all public officials in an attempt to remove "unvisible workers" from the government's payment notice.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid shall be reported in a Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive payments after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenya has promised to reduce corruption in public structures after coming to power in 2013.
The audit conducted earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month fell due to the payment of "invisible workers" and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that payments continue to be made to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports the BBC reporter Vanjam Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants should be present within the next two weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, the Government shall report.
Anyone who does not do this without reason will be excluded from the payment notice.
“This procedure significantly facilitates the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public officials, and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of the Government – hence the issue of “unvisible workers”, said Ann Waiguru, Secretary of the Office of Planning and Structure of the Authority.
Ten Turkish police arrested in connection with the “contract” against the Government
All 33 police officers were detained in Turkey under suspicion of "a contract against the Government", informing local information agencies.
Police representatives did not comment immediately on this information.
Of the detained, 14 senior officers were reported by Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them had participated in corruption detection activities in the past December, which were aimed at checking government officials, including four government ministers.
In July a number of Turkish police were arrested on suspicion of the establishment of an organized criminal group and the hearing of the telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others who were in power by Islamic Clerk Fethoullah Guillen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
In most of Ukraine, schools opened their doors again on Monday (September 1st) after the summer bell.
This day is traditionally a major event for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yaczenuk took his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that he did everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
The first September of the ceremony was not in every school.
There is no peace in every part of Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, the one huge Ukrainian people's front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, head of the school in Slovenia, where the daughter of Jaczenyuk was sent to speak Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will get the knowledge that will benefit them in their future life.
On the first day of school, children are traditionally aware of the hopes of their upper arms, hold air scars, and give their teachers flowers.
In the face of Ron Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an intrepid leader she needs.
It's a team of praise from the world of banking, the management of the media and the internal rounds of Tori's party.
In fact, she has her own experience of working on leadership.
Its career began in the global governance consulting company Bain and Co and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the world of Pearsons.
She was the manager of Financial Times for seven years, moving away when a senior position in Pearson's head office took a lower position.
It is said that her salary is close to £1 million.
Its political ratings are also different.
She recommended that David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of the PP when he tried to bring private sector experts to Withol: she became an adviser to the Cabinet of Ministers.
Her former counselor, Tori.
Earlier in May I referred to the work of the president of the detached chassis.
BBC is not only a large and complex organization in the very heart of public life, but it has an internal paradox.
The Council has two directions: within as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also as a voice of public concern and anxiety when something goes wrong.
It is almost impossible to achieve a double, which requires full radical reform.
However, what a new president would risk coming, disintegrating and destroying the institution as difficult as Chinese Dynasty if he had lost his job in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
This would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see how BBC will decrease in size, after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors mix rounds and new technologies challenge new old habits, inevitable licensing negotiations pose a particular danger to BBC.
According to a modest amount of £145.50 per year, Britain is gaining a share in the world’s largest media industry.
BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work include 96 per cent of households and 40 per cent of them per day.
Moreover, it is evident that the population of Beeb is growing: 53 per cent are supporting it today against 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The BBC models have changed: I now get news headlines on the mobile phone and watch missing programs on the iPlayer.
But she remains a very popular and influential institution.
He needs a strong president. I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says a devastating tweet was written by someone side.
Twitter, confirmed by Governor Texas of the Republic of Rica Perry, contained a disturbing picture of the District Prosecutor of Democrats, who was at the centre of the criminal prosecution of the abuse of power.
Twit was later removed and followed by another account of Perry, in which the record was discarded.
It's just that from my account was published a tweet that was written by someone side.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I picked it up," said a later note.
The Perry Assistants did not respond immediately to the communications with a request to comment.
Although the records were loaded with a confirmed account of Perry, it was not clear who was actually published in this tape.
The earlier tweet contained an infamous character at the prosecutor's district of Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who recognized the leader of the trial in April 2013.
Perry prohibited her office from funding when she refused to leave, which led to the trial of a large jury in Austria this month against Perry, which was a potential candidate for presidential elections in 2016.
Your signature says, "I don't always drive a car in the condition of an experiment, three times the acceptable level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for what he tells me about it."
I'm the only drunk democracy in Texas.
Lemberg's address was not investigated by a large jury against Perry.
They were interviewed by Michael McCorm, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry did not recognize himself as guilty and called for a political trap.
His powerful legal team asked the judge who was leading the case to reject the alleged act, stating that the law used to prosecute the Governor who performed his duties was more than all of Texas's history, which was contrary to the Constitution.
Perry continued funding of $7.5 million from the State Control Division, which is based in the Trevis district and is prosecuted in the Tehas public sector when Lemberg refused to leave.
It was a formal complaint from the left-hand control group.
Lenta of Perry's confirmed account is often updated - and sometimes it becomes a sign.
When he attended the fifth party in Ayov during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to the idea that he could get out of the game, posted a tweet with a picture of himself running around the lake, and said, "You and us, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to normal state.
One of London's most well-known drivers warned that the real estate market in South-East England " has returned to the normal level of activity.
The house in the capital was the subject of a lively demand and a growing price, with a wide range of fears that the loan will cause the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Piggley, the founder and president of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal level of transactions with peak 2013", adding that it has provided "a stable working environment".
London’s real estate market won in the fall, as foreign buyers fell into the capital.
The city's prices dropped by 18.5 per cent in just one year, according to the Land Cadator, significantly increased by 6.7 per cent in England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for the private, accessible and student schemes in Berkeley rose by approximately one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the fund in recent months has made London less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also been reimbursed by the introduction of new insolvency taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “special tax” before the next May general elections.
The London Foxtons Non-Movability Agency warned last week that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent conditions of loan delivery, would also lead to a decrease in market growth, both in the second half of the year, both in the purchase of real estate and in the price.
Fresh data from the Bank of England showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, assuming further deterioration in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its forecast of rising prices on London’s real estate in 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that the real estate price has already begun to decline.
The number of transactions in this time amounted to four times the previous year compared to the last year in the most remote areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to the WA Ellis agency.
However, the demand for a house in the capital was very good for Berkeley, raising sales of more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Piggley added: "The demand for the necessary goods with a good design and a better location remained early and, in the light of this, the sales continued for a time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3742 new houses this year by the end of April, almost three times as much as in the 2007 docking peak.
The annual income for tax payments rose by 40 per cent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pigli reported that the expected revenues of Berkeley for this year would meet the current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, income is expected for a year before tax is paid at £450 million.
The amount of the shares in Berkeley remained at £23.96 on the second half of the day in London.
Photo by Jennifer Laurences published on the Internet hacker
Jennifer Laurents comes to the 85th anniversary of the American Film Academy's annual prize.
The photos of the enchanted actress Jennifer Laurences, who received Oscar's prize, were posted on the Internet hacker, who confirmed that he had a "directory" of 100 more east stars.
The representative of the Golden Games has confirmed that Laurent's photos are present and condemned the hacker for "a hard entry into personal space".
Law enforcement authorities have been prosecuted, and they will persecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Laurences.
Photographs that were significantly posted on the 4chan photo exchange site are likely to have been obtained because of the lack of Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victim includes the name of the female informant, including Ryan, Kim Cardassian, Mary Elizabeth Winston and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is unclear how many of these photographs are true, even though the stars of Scott Pilgrim against everyone, Winston in Twitter also condemned the crime.
"Those who look at the photos we've made with a man a couple of years ago, when they get home, - I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winston in Twitter.
However, Victoria Jastys from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria-victor," she wrote in Twitter: "These are the so-called photos of me FALCHIWKI, people.
Let me put it back in the womb. "Calamburg is intended."
Bizzfeed reported last night that the representative of the planet's planet Ariano Grande checked that the photo on which she was supposed to be real.
The exclusive disappearance of Howard Jacobson's new novel on love and letter "J", inspired by criticism
They were divorced, and they were better said than they were, and they gradually broke up like the cardboard that they left under the roof.
At times, a woman told him that he was too serious, heavy in society, oppressed, closed, and perhaps a little disparaging.
And then she took his hand.
He saw in himself a loathing.
He was a cook, like a cow, yes.
The last victim of this pregnancy was a little novel that he ate more than usual, escape from loneliness and a life of misery and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomonz was a trifle of beautiful hair-cracked and hardhearted from the northern island of the island, more distant and harsh than Port Robin.
She came to the south with her older sister, who Kevern thought she was pregnant, and she finally got a home in the grave, but seemed to be in a paradise of the valley under the happy name "Rician Valley".
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The tunnels, in the vans, immediately sat down, left their tracks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; now the grass of the snakes looks like giant shells.
It looked like a catechism from a child's book, while a scary and amazing, with a full dark garden.
See author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the long list of Bucharest Awards in 2014.
The short list will be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen's seats, held in hand, in a sledge of high grass, enjoyed an unexpected warm wedding day; they both eagerly joined the rain console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when he looked at her baptized Korean feet, he recalled an old song of a long-lost black fellow who loved to hear his father, who had thrown the birds into the house.
You have too much legs.
Because of their aggressiveness, such songs were no longer played on consoles.
They were not forbidden, nor were they forbidden, but they were not allowed to do so.
They've helped them become archaic, just like the word "archic."
The public taste has done what would never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and as among the books people have chosen the memory of the rich, the poor, the culinary books and the loving Romans, from all the music they have chosen.
On that day, Kevin agreed to play in an imaginary fortification and a rough chemical voice to sing the big legs of Ilyn.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz piano song called Fets Waller," he said to her, putting his hands in the car.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J," before she went off with his loss.
It started with the games they played when he was a little boy.
His father played in it with his father, as he told him.
The first word with "J," I forgot to add two fingers to your chest, and that's gonna cost you your penis.
It wasn't a very happy game then, and it wasn't very happy right now.
He knew they were waiting for him, that's all.
He had to explain that this was a jazz.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play either, even though he wasn't officially banned.
Immunization is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the mill began, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
It's exactly the same with the island.
His incomprehensibility has been on people's nerves.
And Jaz was an ossommologist with the help of music.
Although he was 10 years old, he never heard of Sammy Davis Mladsham, Kevin knew about Jaze from the Father's Polyscret Collection of Compact Discs.
But even if he didn't have to tell Yellin that Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, she almost forgot the time when the popular dogs were not black.
Again, no laws or restrictions.
The community was obedient, and that meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude - thanks to those who had been sentenced - with the principle of group readiness.
People of African-Carobic origins in terms of temperature and physical characteristics were well suited to the area of entertainment and sport - and they fell and fled.
In Indonesia, as well as of the nature of the talent in everything that concerns electronics, the family has taken the initiative not to leave without a working phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was the symmetrical work; what was left of Greek was the work.
The refugees from the Persian Gulf and Lebanon, whose fathers did not make the effort to leave the country when what they had predicted, were afraid that they would be accused of burning the flame, afraid, in particular saying that the flames would devour their next ones, they would open up the restaurants with hunger and thirst, would not rise and fall out of the way.
Every man with his abilities.
Just as she had heard only ballads before, Eileen was hard to understand, as offensive words that only Kevin had missed, could actually be put on music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really disturbing," said Kevin.
Except maybe for people with big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the garden started giving him an allusion to safety.
Not one word could detect the flow of gynaecologists who looked like cassettes.
Eileen didn't understand it.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to hang out with her again.
She already thought it was weird.
"He said it was funny," he said instead.
She untrustworthyly raised her head, closed the Kever's review.
There was nothing in the whole world except her tiny black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining with her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you're going to eat it to me.
It was said she was really upset.
Do I have too much legs?
He looked at them again.
I can't say no.
Lodgings, maybe, uh...
And you're saying you hate me because my boats are too cold?
Do I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you because you've got a lot of ice cream," he tried to say instead.
I'm so sorry.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to hunt often led him to a poor situation, for he, like his father, did not have the comforting promise that could alleviate the misery that he had suffered in the streets.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe, and he, Kevin, a hotel.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomonz grew up and got up from Shezlonga, disbanding the console and drinking the wine they drank.
Wine from the pool, so the confession could not serve as a excuse for him.
In her bath, it was said, it was like a palm leaves in the oven.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
Even if you don't like it.
He was sorry for her and because of the too harshness of his words, and because of the fear she felt when she gave him an answer.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in a cold north archipelago where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that she was basically like the present.
The same great ice - skating ocean fell on both of them.
The same men who suffered so much, even more sensitive and attractive after what they had done, would have been killed if their ancestors, contractors and destroyers had been thrown into jail by the pope, ready to surrender their hand to any woman, who would have laughed at them or ridiculed them.
- I'm gonna blow my head off?
If she had not been careful, they would have shown her the calf.
It would begin to kiss -- sex now became the most common expression of erotic dispersion between men and women; opposition to press ballasts that gave out the consular was beginning to kiss and then hit.
It is quite clear that Kevin's opinion is that he's already been in prison for his own self.
Eileen Solomonz, a member of the corporation, showed him that he had to go.
He got up from the chair, like an old man.
She felt her own guilt, but his anger surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She saw him walking, and from the top of the window she saw him walking, and her satellite was a man who drew heavy loads on his head.
Adam, who left the garden, thought.
She felt deep compassion for him and for the men, even though some of them even put their hands on her.
The man who turned away from her with a broken back, wounded and wounded, left it all to fight. Why did she say she knew it so well if she could not remember anything until today when she saw it?
Once again, Eileen Solomons looked at his feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or about Esme Nussbaum, a 32-year-old, intelligent and energetic researcher who worked in Ofnau, an informal community control service, prepared a small report on the low and medium-level level of violence in the most parts of the country, where it was expected to be reduced if not all, taking into account the resources and forces that had been allocated to its elimination.
"Many have been done and many have been done," she wrote, "to alleviate the enormity of the people who have fought thousands of wars and have won most of them, especially among these dirty flowers and narrow deserts of the place where, despite the wars of the church, the low spirit of human kindness has often been felt throughout history.
Some of the qualities, however, appear to be inexhaustible.
The higher the score, the lower the score.
The population is falling down on sensitivities, swallowing stories of the obstacles that have been overcome and declaring their faith in the well-being of marriage and family life, but not only does old poverty keep its grip on both rural and urban communities, but there is information about the birth of new and ill-treatment in homes, at work places, on roads and even on play-fields.
"You have an amazing habit of writing too much," said her science director, reading a report throughout.
I think you should read less novels.
We're Nussbaum's head down.
I should also ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," responded Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has renewed her right to private life and silence.
A feminist?
It's a new silence.
"I'm asking," said Luther Rabinovic, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have a warning here.
We are the servants of society without warning.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy for themselves, can sometimes tell the results, like what you showed me.
Obviously, you're against the churches, and what you call a "bad" and a "grove" would be interpreted by others as an expression of nature's existence and energy.
To continue to offer what has been done, if it has been done, as if it had happened yesterday, means to lose the country of life she needed.
Esme Nussbaum looked at the sides until Rabinovic spoke.
To his head, such as a flame, the celebratory letters have repeated the advice Ofenau gave to the country for the last four or more centuries.
Love your neighbor, your wife's values, listen to the ballads, go to the music, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talk better, sing better than written word, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," responded Esme Nussbaum quietly when she confirmed that her science director had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we didn't treat as well as we believe.
I'm worried that if we're not ready, we're going to find that we're repeating the mistakes that have led to TOM, which I've done, if we're going to do it again.
Only this time will we let out our anger and distrust not on others.
Luther Rabinovic joined the ends of his arms in the pyramid.
This cruelty must have meant endless suffering.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "false" actions that have or have not been done by our ancestors.
You go too far and when you talk about that they've fired their "wound" and "untrust" to others.
In your place, a person should not need to remember that, in the past, it's a protection right now, we don't talk about "we" and "they".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of unrest, that's all we know.
"For whom, if he is honest with himself," urged Esme, "a part of the society can't justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - whatever it was done, it was done.
Then it was.
There's nothing more to say - we agree here.
And no one should blame, no one should justify it if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why did it happen if it wasn't for learning?
It's a past existence for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
The pyramids of Luther Rabinovica are broken.
"I'll look at your report," he said, leaving her.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went out on the tractor, as described earlier, "in a bad light."
The coincidences are happening.
Army Lesotho claims that the conversion has not been planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of the Lesto army examined the preparation of the coup in order to persuade the Government, stating that they acted against the police, who were suspected of attempting to arms political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, stating that the country's army had surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to a neighboring South Africa and said he had been threatened with attempted suicide.
The representative of the army, Major Ntelle Ntoi, said that there was no, in fact, a revolution, but that the army had responded to the threat of "political fanatics", which the police had tried to put on a weapon.
"What has happened this morning is that the command of the Armed Forces of Lesotho has taken action and has received a number of explosive reports that among the police, there are some elements that actually plan to arm some political, young fans of political parties who were ready to build chaos," he said.
The representative of the Government of South Africa, Clyson Monnella, said that the actions of the army looked like a turning point.
"No one has submitted claims to the arrest of the authorities, according to all evidence, that the actions of the Armed Forces of Lesotho currently have major signs of conversion," he said.
The representatives of the Lesoto Army reported that the soldiers returned to the camp on the night of the resurrection and that the capital was peaceful.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing is running the Government without Tabana.
Tabana stated that she believed that she was being attacked because of her attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho was very tense since June when Tabana stopped parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in its united Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government, despite his repeated allegations.
Deputy Chelsea Marko van Ginkel will be conducting the upcoming season of rent in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutch will arrive in Italy in the near future for a medical examination.
In the last season, he went out to field in the London club just three times.
We remember that Milan had earlier rented it in Liverpool, attacking Fernando Torres.
Production in the euro area at the lowest rate in 13 months
The growth in production in the euro area has slowed down to the lowest rate in August, according to popular research.
The latest value of the business activity index (PMI) of the Eurozone industry by Markit fell to note 50.7 in August, with a decrease of 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were suspended, and businesses suffered a growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values were before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting in Thursday.
The markets will wait for a clear plan bank to deal with the eurozone recovery stop and the risk of inflation at a rate of 0.3 per cent.
It is assumed that the ECB leader Mario Dragi could give additional signals later this week that he was thinking of a digital mitigation scheme for eurozones, such as those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Even though some growth is better than any growth, the dramatic effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers will become more evident," said former economist Markit Rob Dobson.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest of 11 months of note 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second size of the block economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to experience this concern, as did Italy ' s weakening of stability to the stagnation.
Noting that the growing momentum in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, is also lacking in confidence," Mr. Dobson said.
The slowdown of industry, most likely, will still bring oil into the fire to analysts waiting to introduce additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of the IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August index of business activity of the Eurozone industry is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The Eurozone producers are obviously living very hard at the moment, as the current growing geopolitical pressure - especially with Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty in many countries.
This growing pressure has evidently been struck by business - and particularly by consumer confidence - and it is likely that some orders are suspended or even cancelled, especially major orders.
He said that "more than that" that the ECB would, in the end, have to carry out a variety of quantitative blends, "as we suspect it will be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariupol are exposed to a live race against the armed forces
In Mariupol a week ago, there was no one to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Asian Sea lived and worked.
Now the people with fear are waiting for the arrival of the Apologists.
According to politicians, the separatists fled to Mariupol to escape to the Asian Sea - a town that had recently been taken by Novosovsk, which had not yet been part of the independent republics.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army would even protect them, but it had a little power against the excellent armed representatives of the DNA-LNR and had been helped by the military.
They grow roofs, build blocks, and strengthen them.
On Saturday evening, thousands of people came to the eastern border of the city, and they stood there in a live hole, playing the Ukrainian game.
They are going to do the same in case of arrival.
Volunteers collect and transport heating and products, collect medications, issue the newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, and banks and banks are shut down.
Ten years for survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the summer school, like children who have been in it, they still suffer.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken to prisons by Czech fighters at school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom have been killed during this three-day test, which has resulted in peace.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied to death at the time of the beast in school.
About ten years after the terrible collapse of the non-School school, during which 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, were warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, arrested and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new fourth, it was said at least as much as possible.
The tragedy combined the east and the west into a turning point, which then miraculously grew into action and hope for the future under the harsh conditions of the mountains.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had been misled by the death of a beast in school.
We have found wonderful young people who have endured disaster, even though memories of the terrorist disaster will live with them forever.
They're the biggest hope?
The war that now strikes Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
A girl who is trying to take a picture back to the shooting room
She was impressed by a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitry Belakov, when she tried to get back to the bombed sports hall after the mine was shot.
In the destruction of Aida, she desperately wanted her mother, Laris, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them were dead, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run away from all the forces, but I couldn't," Aida said then.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and used to go back inside to find my mother.
The soldier took her and brought her to a safe place.
After the surgery, she thought she had completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few differences remained in my knees.
Her goal is to become a dentist, to help people the way doctors helped her.
"That tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't miss her," she says with a call.
"That's happened to me, and I can't change this fact.
Once a year, I always want to be in this sports room to remember all the others there.
My friend and I try not to talk about it the other day.
It's too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my single-class friend, George Gappoeva was killed there.
We played together when they were small and thought we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and I don't start working.
I'm thinking about the family then.
She says she's staying with her, even though memories are a little special every year.
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our plight, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people from Britain and from elsewhere.
When I see it on the Internet, where I lie in a school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, know about our tragedy and do so that it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through the city of the pool, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (the rise began at school at seven) and he spent three days in detention covering his mother Tamara.
Then there were seven of them, and he said, “My mother told me that she would heal me if I blew it, and keep it in her hand.”
After one of his explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Get out of here."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed the child by his hand, and ran through the city of the pool.
His father, Vladimir, who caught the son of a bitch, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara chose to be free and was in a hospital with a foot injury, in her opinion that her son had died.
Then she brought them together and said, "I cried out with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and locked me up.
Damira was later brought to London (now the current newspaper News of the World), where he was rewarded as the Children's Protection Officer of the Fund of the Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Shery.
"This fear comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say he's special to me.
I remember how soon after that I took off all my toys.
But now I can play computer games with guns, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard that didn't choose.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We're saying they're staying in the sports room.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a sports shop where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted and drive in a car with an open top.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where the wars bring him and his friends to the mountain.
This fear comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who had been doing volunteer work in the women's monastery last week.
That's how I want to help.
I'd like to serve in the police any time, and I hope that I'll be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed in our apartment, can you imagine?
I remember the cold silence soon after the attack, there were no children who would scream and run around, and that silence continued for months.
She will clearly remember her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can support them.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her fund for the prize and the opportunity to go to London in June 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that 10 years ago, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember how they called all the local Russian restaurants when Damir wanted to eat the boat.
I remember how he played with the restaurant officials, Damir shot them out of his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And he spent the whole month after our nightmare then.
I was impressed that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think this world hasn't been better for 10 years.
Now there's war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and will be killed.
It's just like our children.
I think for many people war is a news report that they hear when they're bored or when they're busy.
I just know these people feel, they're afraid of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so pathetic.
Damir grew up to be a very soft and quiet boy, not a rebellious and wicked man.
He's not looking for places, for example, he's not stuck on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but they're very close to six single-class, and they're going to the sports hall for a while and they're staring at the candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember how he was lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
No sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw out all his weapons and other military toys, and he's now 17, he's up against me, sympathetic, smart and healthy.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so convinced that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to get rid of the explosion and get up on my feet, I looked, I saw from around me when parts of the body were lying around.
I was absolutely convinced that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this era.
"I remember calling him "Domir, run, run," but I was so sure he didn't listen to me again.
But he listened and acted as he did.
That is how life continues for us, unlike so many others.
Georgie Illinois, 17 years old
A boy who was shocked after the funeral became a victim of a tragedy in Beslan
Room: The survivors of Beslan Georgie Ilin with his mother Fatima after her arrest in 2004 and Georgie's case today
His surrounded face was an impression of fear when he escaped death when the Czech terrorists shot him alone.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of war in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, was the principal doctor, taking him to school on the first day of school before he was taken to Vladima's oldest son at the university.
"I went in two minutes before terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days at a time," she recalled.
Not the only one, there was the family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgie managed to survive.
The closer we get to that date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
Not a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days I've always had before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Falling into the soul: The photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was forever in the sculpture (right)
I remember that Georgie wanted to go to school the day she said she wanted to meet the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of Georgia crying in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like looking at this picture, and she's stuck in a book shop in our house.
I understand, but I also think that this photo makes people feel our pain from all over the world.
George now says, "It's important that it never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this breach of Boing in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what she was up to?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand what's going on, because if you ask people, no one wants war, how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing to do with that pain.
We need ten years to forget her a little.
She's affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares because of the shock, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and single-class people who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this sports hall every September 1st.
I want to give the day to remember my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the sports room, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I'm not trying to complain about myself.
My life is going on.
I finished school this year and went to the medical university in Vladikavkay.
I'll learn to be a karate surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgie Farniv, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite what was found in the terrorist's leg
It's amazing: Georgie Farniev was in a terrorist's leg during the arrest, but he managed to survive.
At the time of arrest, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb on a terrorist killer's leg.
Actually, it's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to learn from the FBI intelligence officer, but was unable because of the damage that had caused his health while he was in custody.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children are easy to deal with bad things, - I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget that.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, it was the first and last time I went to this sports hall again.
I lost consciousness.
I'd never go back there, and please don't ask me to show me where I sat on this famous photograph.
Surviving: Georgie Farnie's opening photo today at the hospital after the arrest
My pain is enormous, and I wear it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like thinking about it or discussing it, and they never asked me about school.
As for the physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with a knee that was damaged, but now I want to be normal.
But my health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical conclusions, and they replied that this was impossible.
My second impression was that the animals were animals, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals from cat to dog.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experiences.
That's not what children should know, and of course not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is near.
I'll go and attend the ceremony that will be held to mark her.
I know Georgie won't come.
She's got to be stronger for him because he was there, but I'm not.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgie's grown up now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept that when something so terrible wrong happens to you.
He's a guy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several operations, he could go, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's over 50%, but it's impossible to get over and forget it.
That's what's going on with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the funeral, and that only strengthened my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were my ways.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart is hurt for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It's hard to believe that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart got me out of my chest at the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I'm working hard on it.
We were a friendly country in the past, how did we get what we were fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure a lot of children have been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could figure out all the rebels and throw them out, as far as possible.
Aliona Ccaeva, 10 years old
A youth who has recently entered a safe place for the fighter
Saved: Alion Ckaevu is in a secure place for the Russian fighter of technology (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember a great crime.
There was a spirit in the world in 2004 when little Alion was taken out of the school in Beslan by the Russian police.
The terrorists left her, but they violently left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old Sister Kristin and Brother Mahar in the sports hall.
Mahar, who was then three years old, survived, but Alonina's mother and sister died in a deadly battle.
Her father, Ruslan, has since been married again, and they have with his new wife, Light, a little daughter he called Christian in his memory of the daughter he lost.
Alion, now ten, doesn't remember anything about the capture, and she grew up in a smart and healthy girl, is talking to the neighbors.
"They are the greatest happy family now, and Aliona and Mahar are both beautiful children," said a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is observed.
You can understand why.
Lieutenant Sidzi Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United in Dortmund, Bosnia, noted that he was impatiently waiting for him to go to the field again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a happy event in the career.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play for Bruce again, which leads to Kagawa's word image.
I feel so good.
Half of the positive emotions and with no patience, when I can go to the field again in the form of "Brussels".
Remember, Kagawa moved to the UK from Bosnia in 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to build up an English club, for two seasons of 38 mothers in the English champion, killed 6 cats and delivered 8 effective transfers.
A man accused of finding a girl on the walkway "Pelikan" in Faire
An 78-year-old man will stand before the court for a three-year-old girl on the walkway of Pelekan in Fife.
Gordon Stewart apparently met a girl on the move to Pitttenvin in East New York.
The prosecutors said that Mr. Stewart had taken his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and lost the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstrutera, refused his trial at the Danish Sheriff's Court of Justice.
Sheriff Charles McKneyer, a royal lawyer, appointed a court date in January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland don't go to Vladivostok
The Duty Free Airport has issued a table prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders.
Don't open them with spirits, water and horses.
The Administration of the Store decided that President Barak Obama, FRG Chancellor Angel Merkel, French President Olland, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known partners would not be able to open their store.
And she brought the appropriate table to the door.
Earlier, Obama had been banned from appearing in less accessible to him in the type of office of the DIG, as reported by the public prosecutor's website.
Whether the American President had ever taken the dream to ask at a digital table in Russia, it is not known, but the authors of the ban would appear to be terrible.
Is there a treasure after the embargo: Medvedev gives advice to the Agrarians
Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that new technologies should be developed in the context of the embargo of the Russian Algerians in order to adjust the release of those who have been infected with acid types.
The Council was given a visit to the "Yugticeprom" firm "Agrocomplects".
The head of the Government also advised the restaurants to refocus on the Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual food embargo was introduced in Russia on 7 August.
The main trainer in Russia, Valentin Maslakov, is satisfied with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted training for mergers.
Our sportsmen have spoken at their level, "You sport" means Moscow's word.
Thirdly, the confirmation of our high level of command.
Happily, the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We must bear in mind that we are not prepared for these confrontations.
The season is over, and we have not forced our leaders to participate in DecaNation.
In recent years we have become the second in this tournament, but in this season we have renewed our ranks.
France, on the other hand, has issued an incapacitated command, which includes 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, as they have repeatedly declared.
But even such a group of sordid merchants could not stand against the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have expressed themselves in such a representative company at a good level.
But in some ways the results were lower than the same Brilliant League.
The season's over.
Of course, sportsmen no longer have that important result, so much more at the level of command.
The main place was here.
As a result, it was agreed that it was absurd that at 1500 m men were so involved in tactical escape steroids that they showed the results below the average level of women's escapes.
4 guidance on improving the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or photograph a video under the water, you have a number of options in front of you.
The most expensive option is the water-pronged mill, for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or e.g. GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for $300.
I made these photos on a family holiday using several cameras, all at a price of about $350.
Regardless of what equipment you use, several rules must be complied with in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other offices are completely closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you'll take.
Some cameras have a tape or object-type mode that optimise the exposure to dark floor conditions.
And before you get into the water, find out how deep your equipment can be down.
Some cameras are estimated at 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our guide for the buyer and the ratings of digital cameras both for traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few characters, because many of them don't get them.
There's a D.C. that will help you compile pictures, when you don't normally have an X-Room.
Even if you have a CSD, it will be difficult to look under the water, and the framework composition will be a random process.
Therefore, make a few appointments.
Also, if you have a serial casing mode that captures a few individuals with a little different exposure settings, use it.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of the world is significantly lower than the depth of the water.
If possible, stay in the surface when you are filming in a pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to pass more colors on photos; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Swim closer to the stems.
It is excellent advice for drying, but it is even more important under water because of the dark conditions of the world.
Especially important if you take a picture on an X-Camer: This device is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get close to the frame objects if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Olympic Ballel Mahov's bronze prize for the 2012 free fight can go through the Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the chief trainer of the Dagestan collection for the free fight against Sagid Sagid.
A specialist did not exclude the participation of sportsmen at the Taskente World Championship in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently at the meeting of the classics team - R-Sport, according to Sagida Sagidov.
In fact, Bill spoke of young people in both ways.
At the 2005 Youth Day of the World, he became the winner of the tournament of volunteers and a third pillar in the Greek-Roman summits and decided to concentrate on the fight for freedom.
It has been a long time since we talked about a new stage of our career in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'm going to say more: Mahov can already speak at the Taškente World Championship if he wins the prize.
But it's always a key word for the coach headquarters in the head with Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was such a man whose personality powers could reach all around, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
An anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the rescue of both the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who called to him was his wife, an officer of MI-6, who had to live with devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are involved with diagnosis and diseases, those who are treated mainly worry about something completely different are pain.
On one occasion in 2007, however, he became one of those who began to fight.
"I didn't feel like usual," he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
Fighting symptoms like flu, he discovered that he had a heart attack on his wife, Juliet.
"I want it to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet went to work for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and unusually upset.
Something wasn't like that.
He asked his colleague to make a breast-feeding ring.
Two weeks ago, he fell on his bed in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray came.
It was a mesotellio, an incurable cancer that affects the lungs or the eyelids.
For most, it is difficult to explain why.
Although some smokers suffer from mild cancer, for example, not all cancers are.
But with mesophone second.
Almost all of this is a contact with an asbesty, volcanic construction material, which was once called a miracle, but which is now known as a deadly threat.
For most of us meso telephony is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbest, at the end of the day, was a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asset has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban has entered into force.
Even when he was used, only individuals from the specific industries worked closely with him: turboisizers, builders, plaintiffs and dock workers, for example.
The industrial toxin from another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
But that's ridiculous.
Britain, it is said, is now on the epidemiological epidemiological scene.
This is where more people die than anywhere else on the planet.
At the rate of death each year, some 2,500 people more than twice as many people die from this disease than from car accidents.
Annual deaths from mesotelium since 1980 and projected deaths in the future in Britain
The reason why we now feel its deadly effects is that although the use of the ass has been illegal for many years (all types of asymptotes have been, in the end, prohibited by the law in 1999), the development of mesotelloma is usually ten years old.
And the threat of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbet was, and in many cases there is still a house where we live, offices where we work, schools where we learn, and shops where we go for shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of attendance, profession or age.
The bots of elections, from the fashionable London universes to private schools, as has been said, are not salvation.
Parliament's building is covered by abscess.
Even hospitals that are intended to treat us have been the reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a thug.
I mean, he had to think about where he could get in touch with an asbestox.
Then he agreed.
"It seems that there may have been a lot of noise in the tunnels in the Gaia hospital, where I spent six years at a train station," he wrote.
All the students, nurses, doctors, and merchants used these tunnels.
Interestingly, how many of my nurses are affected by the same disease?
That was a question that he was unfortunately able to give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who were in the Gaia hospital and who subsequently developed mesotelio over the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "the only one left alive".
How many of us are infected with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed as a mesotelium when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It's been such a long time.
Fifty per cent of patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
She's always dying.
So now we can only repeat the question: How many of us are suffering from the same disease?
According to the leading environmental expert in Britain, Professor Juliano Pito, it is likely that some 90,000 people will die during the 1970s and 2050s when the special epidemic in Great Britain is to survive.
Most people don't think they're going to die this way.

A brief review of reports from court halls, where victims are often called for compensation, shows how far the abuse of mesotelium has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that, in the absence of an examination, Janis Ellen had been contacted with the absentee.
She worked in a network of nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing offices in two facilities, one of which was the chief store in Oxford Street.
Miss Ellen was 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children 20 years of age.
"As it happened," she says, "I've never heard of a cell phone, I've barely known about the person.
I couldn't even think it would bother me.
A few people really know much about themselves.
I mean, abetty is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word "abbestiform", which means a volunteer structure that informs them of the strength and flexibility.
Three of these six were used in construction three times.
Crystal, widely known as white abetts, is much more often met in buildings today.
It was used in the bleeding panels, the floor, the thermosizing of the tube, the knee, and even the brakes of the cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of isolation, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization, “a serious health risk” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is the corrosive acid (mozite) and the deep fat (crokidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest exporter of cornea, and experts believe that “there are old, although there are solid reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of megaphones [in Great Britain]”.
Marks & Spencer's staff had a special impact on Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesoteloma, but Juliana Pito's work makes it seem that her story is not quite unusual.
He conducted a study of patients who suggested that “a significant percentage of the mesotoll in which there was no known impact on the work or home were most affected by the environmental impact”.
Most of this effect, he says, is due to the “normal use and impact of weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, in which the Westminster Chamber was considered, shows how people, even in the very centre of the Government, could have been adversely affected.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical shocks and hurricanes in the seats of parliamentary committees were affected by an asbesty, which the deadly waves could cause to move as safe as "a strong flow of air".
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that it is true.
Although the Technical Services Directive of the Parliament insisted that the Westminster Chamber had received a “pure health certificate”, it now recognized that it was necessary to work at £1 billion on the reconstruction of the Parliament, to improve electricity and remove stress, and that after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might be meeting at the QE2 conference immediately, rather than at the Green Layers of Westminster.
The report of Goddard noted that “the situation with the asset was not governed by different rules”.
It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will be alive.
All we can do now is wait.
One of those who failed to find their contact with the subject was Graham Abbott, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, he suspects that he was affected when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that successfully offered asylum-related claims," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
So hard to remember all the places he worked and the dates.
What he will clearly remember was that day in early December 2009 when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of surgery late at night.
I suddenly started to lie.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't walk all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the lungs, the surrounding area.
However, like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect the interstellar.
In the end, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Doctors have made X-rays of the breast cell and have placed floating catheters to remove moisture from the fluids and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition remained undiagnosed.
His health improved gradually, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms often came back, often after he had a sport and had a heavy stomach.
In 2011, one of Ebbot's patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with "mezotellium".
Even then, however, Ebbott did not relate to his own case.
In the end, his patient was ten years older and worked with a face-to-face.
The connection was clear in this case.
In September 2011, Ebbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor advised him to show the results of his CT and the X-rays of a group of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-armed detonator was placed in the field between his back cell eye and his left eye.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going further," he says.
I didn't have much time to talk about it, I'm honest.
But Rachel, my wife, survived.
The result of the biopsy came to a week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was a mesotellio."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis
Ebbott immediately went to a meeting with Sister Macmillan, one of whom offered to contact the lawyer.
It's probably when it comes to the extent of the epidemic.
“It is shown that abetting has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where it has been often a private thermosation on the pipes,” he says.
People who have been affected by such buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesotelium is now affecting younger people in non-typical professions.
The most dangerously isolated tumors in the hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would suffer.
But many of the workers who went through the tunnels to escape from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson), or either in the double tables (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost really affected by the toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it has been said that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of doctors who treated them.
He's still getting away today.
Schoolers set their fires in Bunzena on special submissions
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbet was often used in offices, shops, libraries and Marys because of her amazing insulation and fire.
School too.
In fact, many, almost all of them, were at first exposed to the influence of their classmates.
All over the country, in numerous chemical studies, the students set up their Bunzen fuels on special supplies.
Web sites focusing on the problem of living in schools have appeared.
At that time, in our homes, such harmless things as a flat plate or a sardine shell, usually contain abstinence.
"It's an industrial core placed in the vast number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lausona in the case against the Gaia hospital.
In one case, the only contact that could have reminded the sick woman was the fruit of the sowing harvest in the 1970s.
Be careful, therefore, to sow seed with a view to the Lord’s Evening Meal.
The effect of diagnosis when it is known that disease does not cure is serious.
"But it takes a lot of time to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I spent two weeks in surgery.
Then I realized I had to go and talk to myself.
Well, I won't meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor to the patient’s condition.
As the number of patients before him, he will remember how much information had to be taken.
"It was hard to know everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous, as is the mechanism of how we support life, just an act of breathing - causes cancer that kills.
Most of the cases of mesotelomas are caused by contact with the abesthet.
Abess is made of a pulverized wool.
When the abstinence is broken down and the lungs are blown, they can strike into the lungs, which are easy to swallow.
The bones of the body are exposed to the lungs and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises because of the breathing of the ovaries of apex," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiovascular surgeon who arrived in the Gaia hospital in 2001.
The hospital, which, as Andrew Lawson suspected, has now been affected by an accident, is now in the hands of the judge leading the mesotelium treatment centre.
The manager knew about Lausanne and treated some others who were likely affected by the hospital.
When the eagles fall into the dark of the night, Treger says, "the breath of the sky draws them to the periphery, where the eye is.
It's actually an invasive process from the beginning.
The usual options for treating other forms of cancer are much less effective with mesotelium.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, creates heated disputes.
Some say it should be tried.
The driver is not willing.
"It's impossible to extract the powder," he says.
It's impossible to get around with the knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is not a very good source of chemotherapy, which "acts" but does not cure it.
"There have been long-lived patients from time to time," says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live well, much longer than expected.
Writer Steven J. Gold died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he had been ill with mesothellian, Ebbott met Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, had turned to the support and advice office for the same patients.
"Allo, the Rock Central," he said alive when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very strong.
In the beginning, Ebbott proposed six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "he's been willing to give everything a bit more positive."
In a meeting with several specialists, Ebbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Lois Lang-Lazdonski, professor of toxic surgery at the Gaia Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," says Graham.
A medium-statistic patient should receive direction and funding approval.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesophones to get the best of available treatments.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern — the future of families they leave behind.
And then they are called to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that obesity has been a health hazard since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very few people could risk their health.
That's when they talked about the lack of integrity of the company.
Andrew Lawson and the Gaia Hospital finally settled the case, but it was not "the full-value settlement", according to Morgana, so that Lawson could not prove that his cell phone was the result of contact with the client at the Gaia hospital.
After investigating his death, the representative of Gaia's hospital confirmed, however, that “abetting in the double rooms where the word went was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lausanne.
How to Remove Anxiety
I mean, contacting a company or a place of work, usually ten years later, has been a major problem for patients with mesophones requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed or closed.
The terrible archives could have been lost.
And those who are protected from temptation know that their time is not yet over them.
In response this year, there were serious new legislation that made it easier for patients to seek compensation, even if their former employers were unable to monitor.
Under this law, £350 million was created for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but who would not be judged.
In such cases, patients receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court would have to judge in the ordinary case of compensation of £120000.
Some 300 successful applications for this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, like many of those working with mesophone patients, believes that £350 million is a "good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is the deal written by insurance policymakers," he says, stating that the amount consists of four things that insurance policymakers would have to pay if they did not engage in a temporary break-in and patients with a broker could follow up and search the company on a regular basis.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was "not perfect".
However, neither Penning nor Morgan recognize that, with seven people dying every day, there was a need for urgent action.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during Bill's second reading of mesotelloma in December last year.
At the time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loika Lang-Lazdonski for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Lang Lazdonski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, was considered effective.
This followed radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tritherapy in which Lang-Lazdunski could receive a total of 40 per cent of the five-year-olds.
Abbott felt a great deal of strength.
"It's, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There's some force that supports you.
When you get up, the situation can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott was in operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scans did not show any disease.
Then I was scheduled for March [2014].
It was a couple of five [hands] in my chest.
I should've done 50 times.
It's not a life-threatening threat.
It's the end of life.
And again, Ebbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of it.
However, this process was both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things -- about finances when I die, for example, or about what a woman needs to show her how timer works on a dancer.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't survive until I was old.
They reacted very differently.
Temsin is very comfortable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and they called us very quickly.
Ellie was more limited.
She didn't talk much.
Such meetings are something that must come to grips with all the sick cancer.
However, such discussions are not equal to hope, even to the challenge of living.
This disease (like, in the end, for Steven J. Gulda) is a dark definition.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesotelium is not a life-threatening threat.

China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protestors claim to reject
The Chinese Parliament decided in the resurrection not to allow Hong Kong voters to vote for 2017, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move, most recently, is initiated by long-term promised protests in the Hong Kong district, as activists began planning and mobilization in the hours following that statement.
In fact, the decision of the Council of Peoples of the United States of America to remove all candidates who are not eligible for Beijing.
"It has not failed our expectations, but it still brings light," said legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
It's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to Hong Kong people.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
In its defense of China's decision, Li Fay, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the heavenly Assembly of Peoples, said that allowing the international leadership to be elected by Hong Kong would be too "haotic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow the residents of the region to choose by voting on the Head of Government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision adopted in the resurrection as a democratic step forward, as it gave Hong Kong the right to vote directly; however, it also made it clear that the Chinese leaders continued to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the Committee on the Transfer of candidates, closely controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer when one of the most extensive and widely publicized protests in Hong Kong had been held for many years.
In most of Hong Kong's pro-democratic campaign, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers threatened to cover the Hong Kong financial area, unless Beijing does not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On the evening of the resurrection, just a few hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central parties gathered in front of Hong Kong ' s headquarters.
The organizers said that their movement was going through a new phase of civil non-conformity and that they would rise to violent protests in the following weeks.
However, they did not report details, evidently trying to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “was thinking of the possibility of occupying the central area only as an exclusive measure, which could only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and no other choice.
We are very sorry to announce that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the coverage of the central area will undoubtedly be cut off.
State authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the Beijing Declaration for a few days, and security measures have been strengthened at the police headquarters and Barricada in the wake of the resurrection.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they slowly lose control of their own city.
The flow of mothers and mothers improves competition in the field of goods and services.
It is also reinforced by the fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations pose a risk to business - the source of Hong Kong's life force.
"The protocol they are talking about may lead to a major economic damage, depending on how many people will participate and how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long been critical of the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is an idea that is valuable for investment.
China's public media also reported in recent days where Hong Kong democratic movements were shown by the dissidents sent to Western countries.
In this summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 78,000 participants to more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July tens of thousands attended one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The U.S. Balls Culture comes to university life: First-time students were invited to come on a private plane
We are happy to respond to this question, starting the first luxury travel service in Britain for current students.
In order to leave a clear impression of coming to university, the company also offers transport options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to take their stuff across the country into a dangerously overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new options for VIF, we are patiently waiting to help students get to university this year with minimum effort and maximum growth.
The representative of the company reported that, as the service was only launched, orders had not yet been made, but added that “the students will begin to order this service within the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that despite the need for students to pay for £9,000 a year, it was still hoping to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to produce a great first impression, and VIF is what is needed for this.
However, the National Union of Students has criticised this service as being removed from reality.
Megan Dann, vice-president of the NSC on higher education, said: "This project is an incredible waste of most students' lives.
Many students who start studying at the university this month face a life-threatening crisis when access to financial support in the form of loans and loans does not result in a very growing cost of basic needs until they can even begin to think of spending thousands of dollars on something of a simple income in society.
Feminists raise the issue of racial identity and behaviour of the police after Ferguson
The armed youth was killed by the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
And the next one will raise his hands, and he will say, 'Hands up, don't shoot!' While they are waiting in front of the graves.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, related to the murder of the armed youth of Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peres noted a gap in the Internet discussion among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists who left comments placed gender above racial dignity when it came to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as the tension in the Middle West grew and national attention was drawn, Peres saw the responses of white women, who concentrated 100 per cent on racial identity.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder on 9 August, the personal bones with such titles as "Thinks of Ferguson from the White Woman" and "Fenism - that is not only about women's violence" appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis that we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so attached to racial identity, they felt that they needed to show it.
For an English-language professor at the University of Ohio, Corriet Mitchell Ferguson highlighted the problems faced by black Americans every day, but not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural field.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'll get 150 lacquers from here," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colourful people are being attacked in their own country, silence is spreading.
"Why are women safe to talk about relationships, but not public security?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied racial, gender and sex issues in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial identity and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly distinguish these problems; they are faced with complex realities every day.
While white women are now joining the issues of racial identity and gender in the feminist ministry, Angela Hatter, professor of female and gender studies at George Mason University, said their predecessors were doing the opposite.
“In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were imprisoned, and, on this basis, the rape of white women was almost always carried out,” Hetter said.
There was a need for a white woman who confirmed the statement to justify the separation.
From the point of view of Hatter, the difference between white and black women occurred when white separatists, such as Susan B. Antony, studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and found that fighting for electoral rights would be effective only for one group: women or black people.
"They have decided to put all eggs in the basket of the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for black people should have appeared later," said Heather.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear explanation of why colour women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after the right of women to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to join the South Women's Association against Linguists.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From the point of view of Mitchell, following the reaction of white feminists to the situation in Ferguson, the conduct of the police, racial discrimination, reflects the time when white feminists had to "know" the problems that black women faced in a number of generations.
"The justice would be excellent if activists with such [traditional feminist] ideology were to be as serious as the right of the child to be questioned as they were about the right to a counter-reception?" Mitchell asked.
The farmers of the second wave, who have worked for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what that means.
A well-known feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, used Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's murder and published a series of articles by the Colonist Guardian Rebecca Carol, which required the white Americans to participate more in the protests on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger posed by the body - and the points of view of racial problems that are significantly different in public surveys - will be in the head of change," wrote Stephen.
Although Steinem is committed to a more disturbing feminism, which includes himself and the problems of racial identity, and the gender, its comments on race in America still surprise some.
A study by Christina Summers, author of the American Business Institute, "Who stole feminism?", She The People said that young men in the United States, especially young people, are “more vulnerable than their sisters", but the laughs of Stephen on Ferguson contradicted the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small programme, My Brother's Watch, to help vulnerable black people and young people speaking, it was followed by an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that leads to the top line of traditional feminism.
After the United States border service had arrested some 63,000 minors without the country ' s South-West Border this year, the immigration reform was re-entered on the surface, this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Meeting, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to address the problem as important to women, she had to share all the stories of women immigrants.
"They're talking about themselves," said Mercado.
When most working visas are issued to [immigrants], women who attend them are placed in positions that are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a challenge in women's organizations," she said.
The Ipswich House is selling with pigs.
The photo of the house on sale in Safffolk was removed by the inevitability agents when it was shown that a large pig was found breathing in a guest.
For sale of £120000, a separate house with one bedroom is on a private street in Ipswich.
A detailed description was made of a picture of a guest's house, where a pig with a head resting on the floor was depicted.
The Connells Immigration Agency reported that the pig on the photo is a pet owner of the house.
"However, the photo has been wrong and has already been removed," the company representative reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of congregations as “a unique house with one bedroom”.
Although the agency has removed the photo from its website, it remains in advertising material.
The sale of the house attracted interest in social networks where some asked whether pigs were sold together with the house.
The Russian tennisist Maria Sharapov, in the middle of the fourth round of the US Open, claims that she does not have stability.
According to the sportsman, she wants to finish the year properly and try to get out of New York, transferred from Vasili OSSIOPOV.
How do you generally assess your results on the Big Bang tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad you've won Rolan Garros.
As for three other tournaments, I was not able to grasp stability, especially at the end of some matrices.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
She couldn't even get to the fourth floor.
What goals do you set for yourself until the end of the season?
After all, I have a great motivation to go to a new level.
I've got work to do, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian tournament series has begun in a couple of weeks.
A member of the Gosduma Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth, former World Championship Nicolai Valuev proposed that GTO be paid bonus upon arrival in the village.
In his statement, the rules will generally be the same as those in the time of the council - people will give rules on promotion, escape and other practices.
It is recalled that 12 Russian actors will begin to implement the GTO norm on 1 September.
I also suggested to the students who left the GTO to give the bonus when they arrived in the woods, I noticed Valuev.
For example, they can add some balls to the EGE.
It is also proposed to provide additional output workers to those who have been tested in sports.
In Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
A game in the Harvey lottery this month.
A new millionaire is sought in the South West from Perth, where one lucky person will collect nearly $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday evening.
The gas pipeline in Harvey brings gold to the main prize for the second time in five years, the previous prize was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to be told about himself.
The thief's owner, Steve Forvard, said that the prize was due in the small town to the south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everything's very comfortable.
We thought this could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia have won a major prize over the past month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week a game from Kenning Weil became one of five million in August, after a huge $7.5 million prize from Belmont a few weeks ago.
The winning pair has been playing for 20 years and has reported that the prize has given them the opportunity to travel in peace and buy a new house.

Mini-economic development wants to speed up the growth of the electricity market
This week, the Minécono-Development Government introduced an integrated plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, told the Deputy Director of the Department of Ministry of the Interior of the Ministry of the Interior, who conducted the "Vedomosti" on Moscow's Autosalano 2014 table.
The plan is designed by the Government, one of the main objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted by the end of September at the beginning of October, said the Officers, the proposed measures relating to electromagnetic and hybrids - the development plan for vehicles on gas fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is in "Vedomosta") was calculated for 2014-2017.
The criteria for the assessment of electricity and hybrid transport should be developed and decided on how to stimulate the use and production of clean vehicles.
The report of the Government, which will describe the tax and customs measures for support for electricity transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the credit and credit licensing scheme will be established by April 2015; and proposals for a reduction in car prices, localisation and service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, Mr. is expected to amend legislation to facilitate the construction of the infrastructure (in parks, parking stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to encourage the use of environmentally clean transport, in the form of benefits for transport and parking, for example; and proposals for the increase in the purchase of such transport by February 2016.
Finally, by October 2014, the Minéconomic Development will include a list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities that reflect the effectiveness of supporting the production of clean transport and the development of green infrastructure.
The electricity market in Russia has only been established in 2013 and around 100 electricity cars have been sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import of e-mobiles was cancelled, so sales are about 500 stock, predicting the Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
However, the five-fold increase in the number of electromagnetic vehicles is not significant: 2.78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold in 2013 by the European Business Association in Russia.
Only Mitsubishi Motors is imported into Russia.
Initiating the import of Renault, the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says the director of the strategic planning and partnerships of Renault in Remin, Russia.
Most of the other electric transport producers were in favour of Russia.
The development of electric cars is also "", GAZA, "", but the release is sweet.
For example, in January-July 2014, ASM-Holdinga, AutoVAZ, issued 30 electric cars.
A high demand for expensive electric cars, the Director of AutoVAZa, by Sergei Amanov Engineering, acknowledges that without the support of a break in this segment, there will be no...
The development of the Russian electricity market in addition to road vehicles (e.g. those sold in Russia, in the middle of two-way analogues with internal combustion engines) inhibits the indistinct infrastructure (union units), inspired by Sergei Celikov, the Autostat.
Due to the expensive and low rates of low-cost e-motive emissions in the next 3-4 years, the Russian market will remain a low segment, predicting the main editor of the Author, Michael Poisanceanski, who agreed with him.
In contrast, car manufacturers say that some models of electromagnetic cars are already close to normal value.
The Russian market has a good prospect, mainly to convince consumers that “electromobility” is real; in particular, it will contribute to the emergence of all new railway stations, stressing the president of the BMW group in Volfang Schlime, Russia.
Such infrastructure projects, for example, are carried out by Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon occur.
Negotiations on the construction of the network will also take place with other regions.
According to the Director of the Department of Rossetey, Vladimir Sofia, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to build buildings across the country, but there are also problems: a small amount of electricity in the country and a lack of a single standard for the purchase of various brands.
In addition, as a network company has no right to purchase electricity, the possibility of doing so in connection with the demand for electricity is being sought.
The Pankok considers the most effective way to support the formation of the electricity market in Russia.
The zero rate will be applied by the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, extending the profit list is under way.
The exchange of transport taxes on the environment (the idea is discussed and related to all machines) also supports the market, but it is not as sensitive as customs preferences that Pankov considers.
A small transport tax in Russia, says Pankov, in contrast, from Norway, where the reduction has led to a rapid increase in the sales of electromagnetic vehicles - 12 per cent of them are now marketed.
In Russia there is a need and incentive for car owners, such as a free parking park in the city centre (as has already been done in Moscow), a convinced Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric cars across a given area, which is still not available in Russia.

Economic News — Did Kiev "Rosnefty" $140 million lost?
"Rosnefti" by Igor Sechin stated that the company assessed damages from the Liscian NPZ in Ukraine at $140 million.
That's what he told Spiegel.
"We appreciate the damage of $140 million and we will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government on compensation payments," Sachin said.
According to him, the introduction of a modernised company was planned in 2014.
However, part of the project was destroyed by the Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no wars, there were no "dangerous rebels", but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, technological oil dropped in the tube," he said.
Recall, on 18 July, in connection with the Lician NPZ bomb, the tanker was burned for oil storage and the building of two warehouses was destroyed.
The Liscian NPZ is the main oil processing plant in Ukraine, the first of which was introduced into force in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Liscian NPZ is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The facility is capable of producing the Euro-4 standard fuel, as well as parts of the Euro-5 diesel standard.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Liscian NPZ was suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repair.
Last year, Rosneft received the Liscian NPZ along with other Ukrainian TNC-WR assets.
The CDC launched a small-scale launch on the side of the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media reports, this took place about 10:30 a.m. on local time from the province of Chagando, which is bordering North Korea and China.

Ruble falls under geopolitical pressure
At the Moscow branch, an increase of $3,7 p.m. to 37.15 p.m. has been reduced to a bivalve race on a geopolitical force base.
The ETS markets in the dollar have started transactions at $37,11-37,2 rubs./$1, averaged in two minutes at the level of 37.16 rubs./$1, which is at 4 times above the previous closing level.
The course of the euro was 48.79 rubs for 1 euro, which is 3 times above the previous closing level.
The price of the bivalve rice was 3.5 kp. and was 42,395 rubs.
The United States dollar is traded for 23 copies of the official course, the euro for 16 copies of the official course.
The Russian market continued to decline on Friday, 29 August, but the panic was not observed this time.
He continued the flood and the ruble and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are already playing a role in the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions for Russia.
However, as it seems more like an art star, I'm going through the media, especially Western ones.
The options for introducing new sanctions to the FFR are not so many.
TeleTrade "In the opening of the Moscow ruble, there is still a sharp decline in the bivalve race.
The geopolitical fund remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, the Russian indexes and the positions of the national currency can be adjusted.
The Orenburg Air Force will be judged with the Ideal Tour.
The Orenburg Air Force has provided Ideal-Turu with a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
This is about two cases to be held in October.
The case will be dealt with by various judges.
As Interfax reports, the first search was filed on 14 August.
It's about 425 million rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 7 October.
The second statement was made on 18 August.
It's worth 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 2 October.

Victor Zukin's airline manager is talking about the amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
Vitaly Savelev is calling it another two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to be more interesting for new users
The Twitter microblogging service has changed the user registration process so that new participants can be more involved in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have lost their microblogging.
New Twitter users will now look at a large number of recommended account services during the registration to quickly form their reading range.
Recommendations are based on the registration of interest.
This allows Twitter to automatically set the focus on the signature for all automatically selected accounts.
For this reason, the user must personally take a photo of the balls so that he does not read those that are not interested in him.
If previously users of the microblogging service only saw the attackers recommended, Twitter now draws a picture of one of the popular tweets of bloggers to help make a impression on people.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration page for the last three years.
Recently Twitter is actively working on modernising the service.
Such activity is linked, above all, to the continued efforts of the service to achieve immortality.
In 2014, the microblogging service was halted by the growth of the user base and the decline in readers' activity.
The company is currently desperately in need of a large number of users' legal resources, which, once again, would remain longer.
Only so can a stable flow of advertising funds be achieved.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be a shameful and disgusting day.
During the first September in the Moscow region, it will be cold and refreshing all day, and meteorologists will be informed.
The air temperature in Moscow is 16 to 18 degrees, in Podmoskovje - 13 to 18 degrees.
When the weather is clear, the east wind will be weak enough - 3-8 meters per second.
The car tilization programme has been renewed since 1 September
Since 1 September, Russia has resumed the car oil programme.
Ten billion rubles will be allocated to these targets by 31 December 2014.
As explained by Prime Minister RF Dennis Manturov, money is allocated from the thresholds that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the RF by redistribution from other sources of support.
The programme covers all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation is from 40 thousand for the light car to 350 thousand freight rubles.
In Russia, such a programme had already been implemented earlier.
The main difference of the current project was explained by the Minister that it is now envisaged not only to shut the car down to receive the next cut, but also to obtain a new cut when the car reached six years old, when the old-fashioned-in-dry-dry-in-diler is transferred to Interfax.
More than 16 billion rubles have been lost in the previous federal tulling programme from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of light cars production in 2010 amounted to 1.2 million coal (in addition to 101.4 per cent for 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator has released a game about contemporary logistics
Gaming director Nicky Cais, a game-known Comeing Out Simulator, decided to release a game of contemporary journalism.
He talked about his project at the Kill Screen.
Casey started to work on the game a few weeks ago, but the fact has become widely known only now.
The source of inspiration for games was the event in Ferguson, where protests began following the murder of the police of an unarmed black child.
In the context of a project that has not yet been named, it will be the effect that the information on history will have on its impact.
The hero of the games, a citizen journalist, will have to photograph what is happening in areas where the police and the population are intertwined.
Hero can take a different picture of what's happening, which affects events.
If he paints the scene so that the police will look like heroes and protestors, the police will begin to treat him better and leave him where the ordinary person can't go.
If he's going to let things go wrong, his photos can turn the peaceful protests into a huge rebellion.
The eyes in the game will need to be collected with the help of a hero's Twitter, where new subscribers will appear if the photos shown there are popular.
The game has no names yet.
The date of exit and the platform to which it will appear is unknown.
However, Casey published a picture showing how events can change depending on how the photo was produced and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Casey, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept of this game for a long time, but he wanted to dedicate it not to the United States but to the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for games, he realized that he did not have the knowledge and skills to discover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media revealing events in Ferguson, he decided to play on the motives of the event.
Nicky Cais is an independent developer who is playing with the browsers.
His most famous project was the Coming Out Simulator, launched in 2014.
This game, which discusses the events of Casey's own biographies, is about how a bisexual adolescent is trying to talk about his or her relationship with gay parents.
Gelettes infuse Ukraine with a blood transfusion
The call for the preparation of the regular "ten thousand" victims of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Valerius Geltei, continues to strengthen the people in the blood-threatening opposition, says the IDF communication.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the statement made by the head of the Ukrainian military department Valeria Geletea, which stated that "the completion of the East Ukraine relief operation from terrorists" and the beginning of the "The Great Fatherly War", in which the loss would be calculated as "ten thousand".
The extent of the capacity of the head of the Ukrainian military office, published on its Facebook page, is an object for the study of experts not in the military area," the Russian diplomats reported.
They are working to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of the Civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister for Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “On informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened that if they continue to oppose us, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons.”
In this connection, he stated that the “Operation for the Liberation of eastern Ukraine” had been completed.
Through Hilton, he removed all the dark images of the star and apologized.
Today, the horrors of more than 60 Hollywood stars cover it.
Hackers broke the primitive password in iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, and their intimate photos appeared on the blogger Perez Hilton.
It's true, it's not long.
Remember, the official representative of the Golden Games star Jennifer Laurents has already reported the theft of photos with her cell phone, and has confirmed that all the pictures that "see" on the Internet are true.
Through Hilton, the founder of the same-named tabloid site, he apologized to the actress Jennifer Laurents and her colleagues for publishing their open photos, The Independent.
No, no one stopped me from doing this.
I had no contact with their agents.
And now I'm taking the open photos of Jennifer Laurences and Victoria Justin," wrote a blogger in Twitter.
However, all the open photo of the star has already gone to the Internet.
David Beckham fell into the DTP, hiding from the paperwork.
David Beckham fell into the DTP on a motorcycle, saving from the patrols.
This happened in Los Angeles on the way to Boulvare Sansset.
The British football player was cut to the ground and stretched his right hand.
Beckham came out of the tato salon, where he was waited for by the poplars.
Despite their motorcycle persecution, he failed to deal with the administration and fell, TMZ writes with a reference to a close to the source's footballist.
In the end, Beckham got a walnut, a right arm and a harpoon.
Tony Stuart suffered an accident on his way back.
The return of Tony Stuart on track has already ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlantic Motor Speedway race.
Stuart fell into the wall a second time after his right of office broke into 172 rounds, ending his statement.
Stuart brought his car to the garage and then went out without talking to the reporters.
His commander, Chad Johnson, said that 14 members of the team were upset, but now focusing on the race in the next exits in Richmond, Virginia.
"I would like to be a more successful attempt and a more successful finish for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond, and hopefully we'll get better there.
Stuart first arrived at the building early in the course of the resurrection night after his encounter with Kyle Bush, which required the repair of his vehicle's right side.
"I started today with a lot of hope to come to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "I just didn't get it."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded onto the evacuater, and the team was gathered and ready to go.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup runners after his car broke down and killed another driver during a race off the bridge in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either at Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to participate in the persecution.
He returned to work during a tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Mladshi, who went on the march to express his discontent with Stuart during the race.
The health authorities reported on Friday that the reason for the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
The decision on whether Stuart would be charged was not taken.
The triangular champion was met with loud voices and applause when he was presented before the race.
I started with the 12th position, Stuart Shell at the first 10 at the beginning of the race, coming to the fourth position.
Then it's 122 rounds after Bush's rehearsal number.
The 18 machine came out of the tractors on turn 2 and went to Stuart, and the two cars were locked in the wall.
Stuart continued, but remained until the 21st position.
Sobuch and Vitorgan are involved in cigarettes with Zvanzki in Odèsse.
The Xia Sobjak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odèsse, where the TV never reported in their Instagram.
True, one photograph was quite a surprise and deeply hurt by the couple’s partners.
Photo taken in Javanck.
"In the afternoon, Michael Michałach of Zwancchi Maxim explains that such an installation:) #Odessa," signed the photo of Xia Sobča.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no cake, no bread, no more...
The couple decided that Ksusha was smoking too, and they condemned her for it.
"And cigarettes chi?, "Church kills!", "Something's cigarettes," "How about breakfast, and on the table only cigarettes))) ""Ksenia, you're smoking too?" -- were allowed for her favorite subscribers to her blog.
Remember, Sobča recently appreciated what a delicious job she had for the first time in her life, Maxim Vitorgan.
"Happy is that when you come to the roof, and your husband has prepared a wedding (first for your wife's life, because it's so delicious. The main thing at the end of the wedding didn't say with anecdotes, "that was now every day," said his husband, Xia Sobcak.
The picture shows that Maxima is preparing something with passion, while the sun and the glass have already been placed on the table.
Prisoners of Bulgaria have taken their national action in protest
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have taken the national action against the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their request to return to the former conditions of work that had recently been changed.
An increase in pay is also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the Minister of Justice of Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding that the previous 24-hour shifts be returned.
Despite the fact that the trade union of prison officials had met several times with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the agreement had not been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BND) reported.
The negotiations continued, and the BND informed the head of the Directorate-General for the implementation of the Rozen Jelazkov penalty.
It is expected that members of the Federal Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will join in the defence of the trade union.
Army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Prajt (right) appointed the Minister for Defence of the Rights of the United Nations (left)
The military governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prajt Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of a new office of ministers of the country in which more than one third of the posts are held by the General or the General.
The representatives of the army received key positions: the Ministers for Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praat Chan-Ocha was officially approved as Prime Minister after the appointment of the head of the interim military Government to the post by King Thailand.
The 60-year military occupying authority in the country on 22 May was the only candidate in the Premier post.
He was elected Prime Minister at Parliament's meeting.
The former army has appointed Members of Parliament.
According to Praatua Chan-Ocha, the conversion was the only way to maintain stability.
He had been preceded by the continuing half-year of demonstrations during which protestors demanded the withdrawal of Prime Minister Yingla Chinawav.
Praat Chan-Ocha will officially be a temporary prime minister, as the military plans to conduct a general election by the end of 2015.
There is, however, a threat that the military are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
Military came to power on 22 May
on the basis of the full parallel of the civil authority.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Shortly after the arrival of the military to the authorities, they had been temporarily arrested by the country's leaders, including Prime Minister Yingik Chinawa.
Some journalists and public publishers were also detained.
The current political crisis is on the ground in 2006 when the army was embroiled in the post of Prime Minister Yingik Chinavat Taxi.
Both are benefiting from the popularity of the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has not always provided them with the election.
However, many representatives of the middle class and capital elite came into the anti-government movement, which had virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that it would be better in the middle room, I didn't promise you that an officer from the new Palm branch was looking for you.
It should be formally recognized that this is true, but the mind and the mind remain unrecognizable.
They've known it for a long time. We're talking Belgium -- we're understanding media, we're talking media -- we're understanding Belgium.
Restaurants like to express their deep appreciation that success depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are places that don't have to be good, but even great, but some inconveniences.
Stepping around the palace of Palm, I remembered that sometimes there was a coffee "Horodok" (in the name of the telecommunications company), then "Odessa-Mama", and another restaurant "Bosol" and a beer "Drish".
Now there's a beer here again, but it's no longer a Norwegian-Swedish, it's a Belgian.
On the ground was just a high thickness: a bar stop and a pair of chairs, all the rest of the space was just a reference to the sun.
So it's fun here, like in a child's room: beautiful, green and green walls, different columns, instead of ocean TVs, where girls swim.
The Belgian authorities in Petersburg haven't been in the news a long time, so there's nothing to compare with it.
Here there are eight different types of beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and an unlimited number of bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive officer is happy to present the menu, saying that the media are the big seeds, and it should be noted: service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is waiting for content, but it is often very unexpected to be executed.
For example, it is expected that a meat roll with a woolen balcony (280 rubles) is, in fact, a karpach, which is so thin, that the permanent book on which it compares to it, that the mother is unscathed.
It's only possible to feel some taste, if you're going to break up with a cop.
It's even worse with the salads.
The classic liege (260) would be more likely to recognize the crime against the Belgian people: some fresh esberg, once opened a long-standing cardboard, dissipating the Kenyan fassole, separated chips from the bacon plus a marinated hole.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a lying salad!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If there was still a way to close the eyes of the blind, the middle ones would have been able to relax and open them several times in their lives!
I already know, there's a lot of normal balmorrhages here!
They are placed in boxes "in your hair on your choice" (490-560 rubles in 0.5 kg).
The seeds of the olive tree, the white wine, the palm tree and the fig tree, were not so obvious.
There's eggs, and there's no aroma, whether there's any wine there or not, there's still something left.
That's why they're looking at the middle of the frits with the home melons.
The cool water here is not a cold, it's so thick that depending on the mood, you can decide, first or second in front of you, and just a nice ski lift.
It was said that the king of the area was preparing a beer sauce, and there was nothing to be said about it.
The situation on the surface was diametrically opposite: the size of the container was all closed.
It was noted that this rabbit was made of extremely mastic beads, which had acquired so many unencumbered aromas.
However, the rabbit has had a remarkable effect on the leg - no, it is just a drop in the caramelized cord.
The waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also sweet, with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clown fish was too much water, and the waffles were dry.
However, when the manager arrived at the table, he was deeply disturbed by the combined impressions.
So you should come again.
The course of the dollar has raised 37 rubles to the IMF on news of the planned new sanctions against Russia in the West.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar calculated "morning" at 10:29 msk rose to 26.9 kpee and constituted 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose to 30 kpee, up to 48.73 rubles, shows data from the Moscow border.
The bivalve root was grown at 28 cups to the previous closing level and stood at 42.28 rubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the maximum amount of the dollar reached on 19 February 2009 was 36,43 rubles, and on 3 March 2014, it had already been 37.005 rubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that US President Barak Obama and Chancellor Angel Merkel were discussing the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia.
The reduction in rubles is long-term, and in cash with the euro, and in cash with the dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this note, says senior analyst Anna Bodrova.
Everything related to Ukraine, whether or not, will be reflected in courses.
As long as it continues, investors will react.
Today, there is no sign of military entry, but the market is very emotional.
All the discussions on his standing up to such news were interrupted yesterday.
The week, according to a specialist's forecast, is around $36,90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period ended, low oil prices, policies, sanctions, gas transit problem across Ukraine -- all of it is a single step.
The inflation gap is also projected: the current price for iron is from 5 to 10 per cent.
At the same time, seasonal crops and fruit will end, and a vacuum will occur until the networks are redirected to other suppliers.
"The dollar came to the mark in 37 rubles, passed it and returned to a powerful star, noting the head of the "Open Broker" market analysis department Constantin Bushev.
They will still see whether the proposed sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as will NATO.
Ruble, he said, was very weak after the end of the tax season, then went to the news in Ukraine, and the CB said last week that by the end of the year, he was completely transferred to the floating course and refused any monetary intervention.
If you look at the day-to-day collapsing, it was nothing different from the previous months of this month, all of them were threatened by a note in 37 rubles, and the analysis continues.
And yes, nothing happened in the course of the revolution.
The alarming times for the currency market were remembered when an increased demand for currency was noted at the end of January, and the third March when the CB was charging a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees a positive side of rubella weakness.
First of all, this is an increase in the income portion of export operations, as well as the competitiveness of domestic producers as a result of import controls, says UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.
The movement of import goods and services can be counterproductive.
The decline in the Russian currency has significantly reduced the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, led to inflationary pressure and, as a result, has become a cause for money laundering, which, in turn, undermines the country ' s economy.
In terms of the stock market, the valuation of the rubles is somewhat similar to the decrease in the price of the shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the MMVB Index in the fourth trade decreased by 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 per cent.
The significant difference in the relative reduction of indexes is due to a decrease in rubles during the day more than 1.5 per cent.
The reduction in rubles is emotional and is driven by a massive desire to buy money.
As the practice shows, emotions gradually become cloudy, and rubles partially or completely recover lost positions.
"We hope that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency around the 36 rubles for the dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic violations are often misdiagnosed
Britain reported that she had spent many years thinking she was going to die after misdiagnosing.
Karin Rogers had spent most of his adult life thinking that she had lived for a few years after having diagnosed another disease.
In fact, it had a disease of Sharko-Mari-Tuta (SMT) as a group of genetic violations that cause nerve damage outside the brain and the phone.
CMT UK reported that the misdiagnosed diagnosis was a part of the problem among people with SMTs, as it was little known about the situation.
There are some 23,000 people in Britain, it is estimated that there are STMTs that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, incredible walking and foot-to-mouthing.
Patients may experience depression or pain, and the condition does not heal and progress, which means that symptoms are being intensified over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought that she was suffering from Fredrey's AF, a condition that was very bad for him.
Rogers thought she'd be stuck in a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, who are now 51, said: "I knew that I couldn't do anything else.
I fell every day, and I had more time.
I've never been able to jump on roles or skateboards with other kids, and I've had a lot to do in school because I've been running and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to release her achyllic syllables and to repair her feet, she looked into a medical card when her doctor came out of the room, and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I had to put my nose on, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the Association AF," she said.
When I received information in response, I was shocked and tried the most terrible panic that could happen.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I'm done 25 and I'll gradually lose all my skills in this interval.
I went through this one, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she was 17 she realized that her ability to walk had not diminished as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up and covered me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that represents a lot less risk to life.
After several genetic studies, she found SMTs.
"When he explained that such an STD, I thought that a happy ticket had been pulled out," she said.
The World Trade Organization of the United Kingdom has announced a month of information on the World Trade Organization to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on the enterprises of the Washington Zone will grow as the economy is restored
The recovery economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State tax accounts and the local level for companies across the country have increased significantly over the past year when economic recovery has been accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and the company in the Washington area is not excluded.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totaled $27.6 billion in state-run punishment and at the financial level in 2013, by 3.8 per cent more than $26.6 billion in 2012.
The tax burden on state-owned and local businesses increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was a third-year increase after the next year when the accounts were reduced in 2009 and 2010.
State-owned taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent more than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to the study conducted by the company providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax income in the district, 56 per cent, is taxed to entrepreneurs, whereas 36 per cent of Maryland tax income is to the company.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, produces the minimum tax income, proportionally from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues due to the return to the previous level of the company's real estate, researchers say that it increased by 3.7 per cent this year after three years when the growth was less than 1 per cent.
While the large proportion of these incomes come to large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same is true in the Washington area.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totaled $10 billion on state-owned and local taxes over the past year, at $9.6 billion more than in 2012-up to 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.
However, the return on real estate does not have any similar effect on the increase in tax revenue per state and at the local level in Maryland, where tax on real estate is barely more than one fifth of company tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What is happening in Maryland is that much of their immutableness, particularly the tax base around the Republic of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to non-profit organizations that do not pay the duty on real estate," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has much more to do, for example, with a view to paying for the same services that are available in other countries.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot fully explain the realisation of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs is also likely to be adjusted according to these data.
The companies in the region have declared corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from income tax, mostly in the region.
Although the trends are addressed in one direction, the tax burden on local entrepreneurs is not increased at the same rate in all three locations.
The rate of growth in the Republic of Colombia was the same as that of the country's average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues were observed below average, at 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (in each of which the same corporate rate) was equal to 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the area it is relatively high - 9.975 per cent.
A study by the United States Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia there are lower taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate with regard to taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The area was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is experiencing a competitive pressure from its neighbor in the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a legislative act that reduces the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate falls to 5 per cent in the following year.
If the State continues to achieve its tax objectives in the following year, this law could bring an income tax rate to entrepreneurs up to 3 per cent by 2017.
At the same time, small businesses in the Washington area seem to feel better and thus pay more taxes on the state and at the local level, according to a recent study.
The individual income tax payments paid by small business owners are the transitional structure for which most small companies - in Okruge Colombia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent over the past year to $2.4 billion, with a higher rate of growth than for the general business.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in tax revenues from business across the country will be maintained in this year, at government and local levels, at 6.2 per cent of the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone can be abandoned, as the reduction of federal costs affects the labour market in the region.
The bronzest century of the Russian yoke
Two silver and seven bronze awards were awarded to Russia by the World Cup.
This shows that the Russians were only allowed to have the main taste of coercion — Japan's collective.
The tournament in Chelabinsk started on Monday, and the first day the Russian army brought a silver medal.
It was owned by Beslan Mudranov, a category of up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the same final battle with Bouldbaatar Ganbata from Mongolia, the outcome of the opposition was the only comment received by the Russians.
On the second day of the tournament, three medals were held for Russia’s collection.
There were a total of up to 66 kg of male squawries in the category, and the bronze was Kamalu Han-Magomed.
In the final one, the Russians launched the 2011 and 2013 Peace Championship of Japan, Massasi Ebinum.
Han-Magomed, at the four-final stage of the missing competitor, won a happy tournament and became the owner of a bronze prize.
In the female tournament of the category up to 52 kg, Natalya Kuzutin was also awarded a third grade.
In the semi-final, she lost the current World Championship of Mailindi Kelmandi from Kosovo, which was under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully protected the title.
In the contest for the Quzutina branch, Ma Inaan from China won, but after the tournament ended, she realized that the third place was not what she was counting on.
And once again, the Russians' turn to gold became Kelmandi, winning Kuwait earlier at the end of the European championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelabinsk, Russia, Moses Moguškov was placed at a peak of 73 kg.
In its fourth round, the former representative of Moldova, Victor Skovovov, who is now speaking on the OAE team, became the former representative of Moldova.
Then, however, the Russians won two awards and became the winner of the prize.
Moguškov spoke at a home chimp with a broken golnostoto that he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a break in the funeral.
With regard to the ex-Moldovian Skorcov, he and he went on this tour to the bronze medal.
Interestingly, Ivan Remarenko, another of his associates, who accepted the OAE sports citizenship, concluded a statement in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the CM-2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze, which was held in the category up to 81 kg by Ivan Nifontov.
In the heavy struggle of the small financier, he won French Alan Schmidt for comments from the opponent.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were held, but traditional growth was limited to one bronze in a man's tournament to 90 kg.
Its holder became Cyrillic Question, since the medal was guaranteed by Russia's collection: its opponent on a satisfactory final was Kiril Danisov's compatriot.
However, the very understanding was not: the opponent of the Question was unable to get to the tammies because of the trauma.
The male bronze was struck by farmers and on the sixth day of the survey, it was placed in a collection room of Renat Said, a category of over 100 kg.
In a refreshing finale, he won a clean victory over the Brazilians of David Moore.
Thus, the individual part of the world empire was completed.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelabinsk, the names of the world's champions were played in command raids.
Both the Russian and male congregations and the women were among the main bidders for the award, but, as in individual gatherings, the representatives of the beautiful field did not get along until the middle of the day.
And there are Russian judoists in command.
In their decisive resistance, they have launched the main forums of confrontation, the Japanese team, in a rapid fight against account 2-3.
At this time, Russia's collection took 2 to 0 after the clean Han-Magmedov and the left-wing Danis Yarceva (up to 73 kg).
However, in more severe weight classes with its Japanese opponents, Murat Habachirov (81), Magomed Magomed (90) and Aslan Cambyev (100).
At the same time, a bronze match was developed in a women's tournament where the Russian Federation, by 2 to 0, joined Japan - 2-3.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who, after the end of the tournament, welcomed a male seiber gathering, attended the ceremony in Chelabinsk.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could be champions," said Putin, whose word led the RIA "News".
The Japanese, the natives - there's nothing to be ashamed of.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian Federation at the home of the World Championship was much better than a year ago at the funerals of such a level in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian army had only three medals -- one silver and two bronzes.
Meanwhile, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstein and Mansour Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximists.
Yeah, he wants gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in an Olympic cycle falls into the worst of the eight, he is the potential winner of the Olympics.
It is more like a sport like a judo," said RF Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko, who led the campaign's press service.
Japan’s congregation is expected to be the best in Chelebinsk, holding 11 medals of various value, five of which were made of gold.
The next World Championship will be held in Astana in the summer of the year.
Other materials, news and statistics can be found on the pages of summer sports.
The John Rivers family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers is unconscious of coming to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai's hospital on Thursday after an extra call about her having a heart attack at the clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscope.
Doctors will keep her under drug control and strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “hard”.
The challenge was widespread, including numerous Internet support from such individuals as Donald Tramp, Montele Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All the Kings Can Do
In the sale of a questionable Royal Blood album, a new hope for Britain's year, which came out of the club directly at the stadium.
Two Royal Bloods every year at the stage, but already has an active nomination at the BBC Music Award, a tour of the Arctic Monkeys, and a visit to the New York concert player by Jimmy Paige.
They have received 100 thousand orders a few months before release, and the contract for their release is in the Major-Lebble Warner Music portfolio.
In view of the current crying situation on the music market, the situation from a number of outsiders is not about the new Lane Del Ray or the actual sweet smell of the "new R'n'B" and about two British players playing with that level of pride and intensity that last time was in the fashion of a couple of decades ago.
In general, the rates on the first album in relation to all the above-mentioned circumstances have been particularly high and have already been fully justified.
The Dutt didn't see a name that they could have achieved until then that all of the wanted metallics had already died, and the blood of the kings they thought they had in their homes is understandable.
The thing is, of course, mainly about the heroes of the previous level of Led Zeppelin: as a great neighborhood, Royal Blood is aimed at detecting the blood of the British year by taking it to a new height.
To predict the success of this company until, please, the morning, but something can be confirmed.
Ten songs that were placed in 30 minutes with a little less than a demonstration of phenomonic composition, as much as a reliable and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some of the values of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say, the pilot's ring "Out Of The Black" is that it's not a melodic line but a drum party.
Musicists are saying that this song is actually more exciting than drinking.
It is also possible to assign the powerful Little Monster and the closing plastic composition of the Best Strangers with the Shakespeare title.
It is true, however, that each of these songs will sound excellent at the dinner of lovers of the hard year, but when they are played, they will fall into more or less of a national holiday.
And that's not necessarily bad, even the opposite.
The Royal Blood Force did not claim new Lennons and McCartney's labs, but they took many rockets out of the Indi Clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for stadiums, in a space of less than a thousand people, apparently close to it.
The key to the hytrom of using the base that replaces the guitar in the normal form that was suggested at the beginning of The White Stripes.
On the other hand, it is not only in instruments but also in the way of the composition of the song.
Heroes of the zeros with great effort have been selected beyond the post-modernist paradigm, with a huge lack of interest to recognize themselves not just by the epigons but by the unique creative units.
Royal Blood has already been so powerful and urgent that this effort has successfully dealt with some duality and strength of musical material.
Well, at the end of the day, who said that the time should be wise?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON only confirmed what it reported on Friday morning: Online Magazine - and videostores, and hundreds of other things - purchased the Twitch stream video production service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
The news was surprising not because no one had forgotten that Twitch would be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Google's Twitch video server for a good billion was completely ready, and such a combination seemed natural.
Twitch, based all three years ago as Justin.tv, has set the goal of being a running public service - a real time version of YouTube.
Instead, he quickly became a platform where the gays transmitted their internal moments; "YouTube for a real time game," says Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genius of videomakers who give (mainly, old) a game of processing like the "Taine Theatre", already popular on YouTube.
The fact that YouTube is often mentioned when it is described in Twitter is so news that YouTube's acquisition of it has been met with no particular interest, a classic example of a cutting-edge technology company that buys potential competitors.
This is the secret why the deal with YouTube was broken, taking into account that, according to the evidence, he was willing to pay less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement by Executive Director Twitch Emmeta Shira: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, honestly, is the amazing success of Twitch.
My dreams, which say that it would be better to take a sport than to look at it, are hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games rather than to take them into the hands of the Jostics themselves.
One thing is to look through each other's shoulder on the 3th morning when it passes through the Resident Evil, and all the other, see how some sideman gets 20 shots in the head of Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are calculated on one person, so looking at them, without controlling the angle of vision, can be a recipe for the headache that is worth Do It Right.
I agree that the speedy passage in which Roger Bennisters of our electronic age finish all the games in record time is fun.
But if it's not about the virtual game or noise, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be quite interesting.
But what do the sceptics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and this is the fourth largest Internet traffic source.
How does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is going back to Amazon Instant Video just as wonderful as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has what any company would be pleased to have: the mobs of young men who are dreaming of advertising.
As Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future game," and this channel does not give clues, even though it's a brain - as an exciting form of sport.
As a result of the 2004 earthquake, more than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
They spoke with survivors - almost all of the students, with the parents of the deceased, with the observatory - City of Angelov - Ramon Kaspolat, head of the Committee of Mother Beslan, Sussan Dudie, who participated in the surgery by a MIC staff member, - told the corresponding department of Elizabeth Antonov, working on the project.
On his return to Moscow, he met with Aslambe Aslahanov, who had been the adviser to the North Caucasus for ten years and had negotiated with the terrorists, as well as with the Russian FSB Office of the West Bank.
What I particularly missed in working on this topic is that it wasn't in Beslan for the past ten years.
This subject is extremely painful for all who have something to do with it, people with difficulty agree to say what has happened.
The impressions of the trip are very difficult.
But I can't forget Beslan, and I hope we're done with our task," said Antonova.
The project was prepared by the Holding Rambler & Co Infographic Study, which has been working with the company since that year.
The previous projects were devoted to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of the residence of Vladimir Putin in power.
KNDR conducted the launch of a small-scale rocket
North Korea has launched small-scale rockets in Japan's waters, reports Renhap.
The launch took place about 10.30 a.m. on local time from the province of Chagando, which is bordering North Korea and China.
It is estimated that the rocket landed at the Japan Sea, some 120 miles [220 km] in the Joint Committee of Heads of South Korea.
Members suggested that the entry into force of the Personal Data Act be accelerated
In the event of success of the initiative, Russians will not be able to keep data on foreign servers since 1 January 2015
The Commission has introduced a draft law providing for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Russian personal data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower room.
Its sponsors were Mr. Vadim Düggin, Mr. Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Mr. Evgeni Fedorov (United Russia), Mr. Vladimir Parahin (Russian Justice) and Mr. Alexander Juttenko (KPRF).
Such a change, in the view of the sponsors of the initiative, will contribute to the more operational and effective realization of the right of RF citizens to the maintenance of personal data and to the confidentiality of the information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, by which parliamentarians are being brought into force, requires Russians to keep personal data processed via the Internet in the territory of the RFF.
It also makes mandatory records, systems, collection, storage, clarification and retrieval of personal data by the RFI citizens in the databases located in the territory of Russia, as well as information on the location of such databases.
In addition, the Law confers upon the Roscomnadsor the right on the basis of the court's decision to restrict access to information processed by a breach of the RFI legislation in the field of personal data.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called “black lists” of sites of offenders - an automated information system entitled “Registration of the rights of offenders of personal data subjects”.
This law was adopted by the Lord summer.
The sponsors of the project spoke by Andrey Lugovoy and Vadim Düggin of LDR and Alexander Juttenko of KPRF.
Dügen and Juttenko are also one of the authors of the current legislation on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Act.
The person who has no data centres in the RF should pay for the rent.
Commenting on today's draft legislation to the Lord, the First Ad Hoc Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin stated that he did not see the problem of transferring the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that would not have their own personal data in the RF territory by 1 January 2015 would be able to acquire them, for example, in Rostlecoma, who had repeatedly said that they were willing to provide their servers and are already providing their servers with Mail Group to Western companies that are already providing their servers.
"There are also several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the RFI, they will not see problems - they will get technological opportunities for accommodation," Levin pointed out.
Suspension of legislation
Shortly after the publication of the draft law, the Russian electronic communications association expressed the fear that no longer would be able to use many global Internet services in the event of the adoption of the draft legislation.
In particular, it is about the services of online aviation and railways.
In the view of the association, “the bill prohibits the right of citizens of the Russian Federation to manage their own data in an imperative manner, by determining that their records, systemization and so forth should be provided only on the databases available in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a user information mechanism on where the record is made, to systematicize its personal data.
In that case, it will be possible to choose which territory the action will take.
The adoption of such legislation on the location of personal data in other countries has led to the treatment of global services and significant economic losses.
The ice-cream test revealed a fever
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain cried so much when the ice water was poured on her head, which damaged the bone structure of the person.
It was a test of ice water that caused no pain.
The woman was hospitalized after she was so screamed during a cold water test that the crowd shouted.
Isabelle Roberts was so furious when the ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the structure of the person.
"The water was so cold that I cried, but when I did, my face started to shoot," she said, "the Mirror.
The water's flowing for 20 years.
Isabel Roberts for seconds until the accident.
I tried to close my mouth, but he didn't close, he shot, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and began to cry, but I had to get to the emergency office quickly.
A 20-year-old woman from Great Britain was taken to the hospital to conduct a funeral after she attended a public service on Tuesday.
The clip became online and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia transferred more than 400 troops to the Ukrainian military
In the New Jersey Army, they claim that the Ukrainian Su-27 has been defeated and accused of violating the ceasefire agreement.
As at 10 a.m., 402 people, 72 of whom were injured and 35 dead soldiers, were transferred to the Ukrainian side of the camp on 1 September.
In this regard, the representative of the Press Service of the "Armiya Novorossia" reported to Interfax.
He added that “by PWO forces in the area of the Mereški population point, the Su-27 aircraft violated the ceasefire agreement”.
According to an agency associate, the Ukrainian side of the Lugan airport had applied the banned international conventions of cluster munitions.
The representative of the Press Service noted that night soldiers had been able to damage two Ukrainian VVVV helicopters on one of the field airports, as well as destroy two bront carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The mother of the opponent - until she was killed and wounded - was put to death by 13 people," the representative of the headquarters recalled.
Interfax does not have a confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
In the resurrection armed formations of the “National Republics” of Donbass, the Ukrainian side has declared the transfer of 223 full military personnel and troops to the Ukrainian National Guard.
At the same time, on the night of the DDR Army, according to the "Armiya Novorossia", "the attempt of the Nagwardians to break the agreements that had been reached to remove heavy technology from the area".
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, six tanks and 198 military personnel.
According to the headquarters, the total loss of the enemy in all directions (Donecz, Lugansk, Mariupol) by night was five tanks, eight warships, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian military personnel were in the district of Ilovakia in the Danube region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin requested the leadership of the “national republics” to expel Ukrainian military personnel from the area.
The DDR agreed to do so under the terms of the arms embargo and the arms embargo.
The first 10 military officers began to leave the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defense battalion of the "Donbass" Semenčenko, 14 more people came out on the night of the resurrection of the cat.
In his Facebook book Semenčenko, the Ukrainian wounded are “in the field of 137 sub-group 32 of the RF and 9 tankers” where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the IMD and the Minoborons of Russia examined reports from Ukrainian military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
IDF: Russia will take responsibility for the introduction of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to respond to measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-terrorism sanctions, reports the MDR.
The report of the Russian External Deployment Bureau said that the European Council ' s closures of 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU Member States to overcome the intensification of their unsupervised support to the key authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia participates in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on “supremeless allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of the country”, the Bureau's website says.
IDF regrets that, contrary to the interests of its Member States, Eurosov is affected by countries that are interested in strengthening the conflict with Russia.
Members of the Eurojust should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and also provide conditions for a comprehensive " dialogue between the opposing parties", the Bureau emphasized.
It is also noted on the website of the Bureau that there are no objective humanitarian assessments in Donbasse, where the total humanitarian disaster has occurred and the number of victims among the peaceful population has increased.
We remember that during the next week in the European Union, specific sanctions proposals are being drawn up.
Representatives of the EU are working closely with American officials.
They are expected to correlate among themselves the measures introduced for the period of action and the degree of severity.
The new sanctions of the Eurojust can be abolished by the energy and financial sector.
The Australian Government also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the field of defence, finance and the oil industry.
Quick ways to earn money at university teachers
While the cost of university teachers for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move on to a second course, made a quick way to reduce costs.
He developed a system to take books almost to the seniors by offering them a nominal compensation to give up their sales.
"My mathematical analysis teacher, who is usually $180, got me at a semester for $10 and the Chick-fil-A pen," says Shreeder, 19 years old, who is studying at the Covent College in Georgia.
The required literature last semester would be $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Board of Colleges, the average student spends more than $1,200 per year on teachers and students, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas such as the Shryóder system.
The procrastination of the book is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and it is often more expensive than buying it.
The Nibo Incorporated Company, which owns more than 250 university libraries, reports that the proselytism of the book has doubled since 2011.
Studies show that about a quarter of the books in the university library stores have been taken over during the past weekend, says Vice-President Trevor Meier.
Less than half of all books are obtained in university libraries, according to the professional association of the National Association of University stores.
This is an input course for the best way to make a good deal.
Buying online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you see in the university library.
The ninth edition of the "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is about $290 per survey, but a new sample can be obtained for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of teachers.
Purchase of the held
If you're not against foreign trades or injuries, the schoolmates are a good option.
The mathematical analysis is sold for $93.49 in the form of Chegg.com.
Matt Kesedi, 25 years old, a student at the University of Brigham Young, said he paid 42 cents to Amazon.com for a supported copy of the teacher's "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding of the Business Party of Advertising".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Breese, Director of College Without State at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, offer students to clarify to their professors whether they can use previous publications.
There are times when updating is not essential for employment.
In such cases, an old edition can often be found as a very small part of the value of the last edition.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon websites, Half.com, owned by "eBay Inc.", a popular alternative for buying supported books.
Prototype
In order to take the teachers away, you should think that if you are good enough to talk to them, do not forget them and do not want to leave them after the course ends.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take a bit of "Mathematical Analysis" at a semester around $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you are taking books, including any taxes that you may write on notes, comments and damages.
If you take the book a little bit, remember: If you don't return the book, the tapes can even exceed the value of a new sample.
E-books
Electronic books instead of traditional teachers are another option.
At times, such books are purchased separately, obtaining an electronic licence for a given period of time to distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The “Mathematical Analysis” brochure is available on the Chegg.com website for six months at approximately $61.
Bressie says that students studying literature can often find the most profitable prices, as many classics can now jump free, while literature on nature and engineering can be very expensive.
Whatever it is, check it out.
Joe Golt, a 29-year-old student at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to clarify the price of the book, as this ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering the Internet, Golt says it's mandatory to check if the book really is on the table.
It's not easy for him to learn this lesson.
The delivery of the book he received was suspended for four weeks, and finally he paid a full price in the university library.
Putin declared the full ineffectiveness of the Development Fund for the Far East
Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at a meeting on priority investment projects and territories in the Middle East, that the budget investment in the Middle East, established two years ago, was ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubles are still on deposits," the president stressed.
At the meeting of the Head of State, he called for the speedy approval of the list of developing territories in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of the TORO should be submitted to the Lord this week.
The Federal Assembly, noting the President, did not approve the list of the areas of development in the Far East and their criteria until 1 July.
Vladimir Putin also outlined key challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increased transport availability of the region, removal of infrastructure restrictions - both on the internal market and on export development.
In addition, the President stressed the need to create a forwarding approach to attracting additional investment in the region, as well as forming the developing countries that should be competitive in relation to the key business centres of the ADR.
It was previously reported that the Overwhelming Development Territory could replace the OECD.

Silver Stallone returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the United States, when he returned only $12 million from his $70 million budget.
The "Home Video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first exit, while children's films, such as "How to Hand Dragon 2" also disappointed the release.
The article “Telegraph Lord Colin’s cynique” indicates that when it comes to children’s films, it is likely that they are in bad shape.
Colin referred to 2014 as "the worst" year in the history of child movies, and called "How to handle Dragon 2" rather than "functioning" the fants.
However, when it comes to films directed to audiences of a number of age, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the same as films.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of cinemaScore and Metacritic each film that was filmed in the summer of at least 2000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of both cynicists and cynicists suggest that this year's film production is similar to the calibre with the past year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing stereotypes and increasing the popularity of stream Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on the film of the "The Book of Jungle", said on the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think time is changing."
We must admit this and not try to get angry about what was earlier.
In contrast to the current decline in the cash collection in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the current production service reached $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year's figure in $337 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spilberg criticised the studies because they relied too much on the French comics, and predicted Golivud's Creature.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his dark predictions were part of the truth.
As a result, a number of potential casinos, including the Artists: Eri Altrona, Minionov and the Iron Park, are expected to emerge in the summer of 2015, the other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
The Human X vendor Simon Kimberg recently called the fall of castes just "cyclic," said Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the most censored summer in history, and no one will ever survive."
The product sanctions do not frighten the owners of the facilities with the Caucasus and the Mediterranean, but for the restaurants of the European and Japanese cuisine of Russian suppliers, it is a terrible dream.
In general, it is still preferable to place prohibited imports not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a little bit worse than a bad mozarella," the head of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio on the quality of beer offered by its suppliers instead of Italians.
Mozarrella and the cheese of the butter ended up in the first restaurant, with a small period of storage.
The stock must be caught within a few months.
What to do?
Go to the Russians?
In 2005, I was on the Dorgomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes this clear: shocking memories do not leave him alone.
The meat was lying all over 30 inches [30 cm] from the ground!
There you go!
Cross!
Then I said that for our restaurant we would never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's all over now.
But these days they brought me a fish from the Far East.
That's what she said!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy are for the Russian producer in the kitchen.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy a Russian hat.
In Italy, meat in the refrigerator is heated for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must be relied on to make it easy for the muscles to weaken.
I did all this with the local head.
Then I was asked, "Where did you get that little meat?"
I said, "That's yours, Russian!"
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
Five minutes from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" on the kitchen is a stop-list showing the missing products: French recipes, sea food.
The head-powa restaurant "Brasserie Most" and seeks "Strellka" Regís Trigel are not as pessimistic as Valerio: French opponents have already replaced Tunisian barriers, and instead of French restaurants will buy Swiss.
In addition, Regis is becoming more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The color coat is 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why is she so worth it?"
They say, "We have to work too."
But this cap shouldn't cost 80 rubles!
We're buying the long-term dividends, but they're 15-20 years old, you know, how much do you think they're wearing?
It's worth it. It's superdelicat.
Russian suppliers appear to be one of the main sources of fear for foreign disputes.
The standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality was very bad."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot maintain stable calibres and quality.
Many restaurants in Europe do not know that they will be with them when the stocks of cheese are finished.

Sanctions Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed an order on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the safety of Russia, which are called the main product sanctions.
The country is prohibited to import beef, pigs, meat and sub-products from domestic birds, meat delicates, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, fruit, rice, beans and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started gambling with suppliers: prices for products have grown, they need to seek out the same from other countries quickly.
More strongly, this is said to be on the streets of monocochne France, Italy, Spain, where products were placed directly from the "Materin" countries.
The debate came to an end before.
For example, when Roselhoznadsor banned the introduction of Australia's capital in early 2014, the previous year was the American and Canadian meat.
In exchange, suppliers have established head supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the 2014 sanctions were much more serious.
In fact, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which was issued under the prohibition of small Atlantic forests and forebears, non-lactose milk, seed potatoes, sugarcane, corn and cheese.
Italian Valerio hopes the sanctions can still be lifted.
As long as part of the restaurant exists in conditions of uncertainty.
According to the West Bank company, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the proportion of imports in the primary segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants have to change the menu of local farmers and other countries, says Sergei Mironov, the restaurant owner of the Restconsult Agency.
If the chief's strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We've only got very few of these conflicts, and a new menu can go on for two or three months.
Trigel from the "Brasserie Must" restaurant is ready for this: 10-15% blod, another half of the menu is to be reprocessed.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, they are already replacing flowers, such as a tree from the dark head on the buffs, says Sergei Mironov.
"Sea from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian, Serbian, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile - a representative of the East West company Oksana Glibschuk.
Slovene and milk production from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
The roots of the United States can be replaced by the roots of Russia and Belarus, the forest and the seven of Norway - forest, the family, the branch of Belarus and Chile.
The lack of fruit and fruit of European production can be compensated for the production of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
In Mironov's view, the budget network will be restructured rather than the primary segment: whether there were rounds, which could separate the Italian mozarella from Russia.
Although it is difficult to reach the Ginza Project, he considers it to be.
Ginza Project has several dozens of restaurants under different brands and with their menus.
They're going to take a dog for a while," says Mironov.
In Ginza, comments were rejected by the authorities in the country.
The coffee owners of the Caucasus and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than Europeans
But there are no restaurants where the sanctions are not in practice.
It includes the holdings of the SNG kitchen: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," said Hatuna Kolbay, the owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the coffee "Wi me!".
We're doing all the cheeses for us in Russia, based on a lot of blue, chicken, and we don't use the exotic green."
There's not even one blue in the Kolba holdings until they get out of the menu.
Timura Lannski, owner of the Chechon N1 restaurant with a Uzbek kitchen, also does not disturb the sanctions: changing it is only a jet in New Zealand.
If Russia has imported from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, for us it will be a lot more than a European import, he says.
SNG can produce extracts, enamel, powders, urticaria, fruits.
However, what they bring from Central Asia is much better than a plastic from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About the Uzbek beads, everyone knows they're delicious, sweet.
No one's talking about Spanish like that.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artikov, stated that he planned to increase exports of fruit and vegetables in Russia by two to 2016.
Its intention was to place European imports into Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Restaurants who responded to Deneg's request also respond peacefully to sanctions.
Press Service McDonald's said the location was over 85 per cent and the network was working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Boldan, director of the Department of Business with suppliers Subway Russia, about 80 per cent of the net purchases are available in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with supplies of fruit and vegetables at increased prices for meat products produced from imported raw materials.
No more than 4 per cent of the "sanctionary products" were in the Teremke.
They didn't touch the Sanctions and the Wooker.
KFC, Burger King and the Red Card did not respond to the "Day" request, but other market participants claim that Burger King's location is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norway's fishing, the restaurants are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian overseas.
On your back.
As long as the restaurant complains that prices are growing even on local products due to the increase in demand.
"The prices for "Graves" increased by between 10 and 15 per cent, for the Italian Cherry Mio restaurant - twice," said novelist Roman Rožnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the quality of the flower will grow by 5-10 per cent, and it will be recognized by Colombia.
The West Bank does not deny this: "For example, Belarus's milk production from the beginning of August was 10-15 per cent".
"The Brazilian suppliers have raised prices on the pig nearly twice, namely Sergei Rac, Deputy Director General Stardods.
The rabbits traveled 35 per cent.
A price price from China, perhaps they're burning Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardox will be expected to increase the price by 8 per cent.
Now and so desperately to raise prices, says Rac.
Statistics show that the second quarter of 2014 is 1.8%.
This is the smallest indicator after 2010.
The different prices will grow further, he acknowledges, but suddenly, as soon as the majority of the restaurants have stored products for the next two months in hopes of transferring prices.
But what's going to happen in two months, nobody knows.
In front of the temple, Moscow has ten cedars decorated with green and wood.
At the center of the stage, musicians play the Vals.
It's a regional festival called "There's time."
"We've been going to have a local meal for a long time, and here as a penalty, we've been down, organized a festival," one of the organizers says.
On the stage with the musicians, Anasthes is preparing the halls of macaron and home concerts, and on days was a master-class to prepare a latrine with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products are confirmed by the organizers.

"The taste for restaurants can be replaced by a peaceful exchange of another forest fish from the Far East," said Philip Galkin, owner of the fish-fishing boat "His people."
We've got the energy, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norway's forest, because it's a pretty fish.
The Norwegian forest is the same aquaculture.
You take him in your hand. He won't even be ashamed.
And you won't hold on to our long-lasting forests.
Only institutions with no special claims agree to replace the Italian parent-in-law
In the winter, his hat is a bed with a bag of "Magadan", a piece of grass, a mulch, a muksun, a medium with Crimea, a grass with the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's been a long time since he moved to a fishing from the Far East.
According to statistics, fish stocks in Russia in 2013 are more than 4 million tonnes, a large proportion of fish are found in Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - around 800 thousand tonnes.
The People's League has been working since 2012, sold fishing via the Internet, and has served more than a dozen restaurants before sanctions have been imposed, for example, the Free Things.
More than 15 restaurants have now been applied to Galkina.
The same soup can be made from our fish, it burns.
We got tired, tried different recipes.
Now we're drying through the Internet shop for millions of rubles a month.
Our fish fell a few times, and the delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation of Galkina, I'm getting Philly's cheese with ketchup.
Unlike the role of the family, they come to eat longer, but the knowledge that this fish is our father-in-law gives strength.
On the "His People" label, there are even roles from the palace and the sea occident.
In Sushi-bara, it's true that replacing the Norwegian forest is preferable to Chilean.
Galkin explains that I'm going to take the lion to think about new recipes from the far east fish.
"The Russian fishermen have not been offered to us before," explains Governor Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
The same is true with other products: Russian producers could take the freedom of movement, but that is not the case.
According to the founder and holder of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimova project, it is now possible to speak more quickly about the location of imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large sizes.
They can quickly replace the prohibited imports from our farmers.
This is a ban that the major producers of other countries are winning first," says Akimov.
In addition, in recent months the restaurant has received a more alarming signal than the product sanctions.
As a result of the massive in-depth verification of Rospobnadsor, the activities of three McDonald's companies in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the nature of the claims made to determine the actions necessary for the rapid opening of restaurants for visitors," said Dügham in the McDonald's press service.
No one really understands what's going to happen.
If everything is limited by the product sanctions, this is one option that can be overcome - the company's affidaviting staff member is speaking on the terms of anonymity.
If McDonald's were to be closed all over the country, the scenario would be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of a GIBDD solution
Casual payments will be received without a refund from the GIBDD - so the CB intends to stimulate the implementation of the Euro-Protocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft directive which, as of 1 September this year, would allow the car in question to be charged without a refund from the GIBD.
The truth is, it's only about cases when the accident was formed under the "Eurolog" without the involvement of the road police.
That is if only two cars were involved in the DTP, not physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the limit set and both drivers have reached agreement on who is the cause of the accident.
As of 2 August, the Euro-Protocol fee is 50 000 rubs, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad areas, it will increase to 400 thousand rubs.
The fact is that, even in small cases, in situations where the TIR can be formed under the "Europrotocol", drivers in the event of an accident call the DPRK.
However, while the police were available, it was impossible to obtain a refund without a cure from the GIBDD.
The parameters described in the draft instruction are how and when to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment of cash in connection with VAT issued without GDP staff should not be below the limit of the "Europrotocol".
However, it cannot be above the limit set by the casco insurance contract.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPRK and roads.
But sooner or later, they don't come to the village or car drivers or insurance.
The latter are now talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on cassette payments.
With regard to leaders, it is difficult to imagine what work must be done to overcome genuine Russian conservativeism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for an inspector to set up a small accident, as it is more reliable.
And it is still unknown that it is simply to defeat the Mossians or convince the leaders of the Euro Protocol.
The storage certificate shall be issued by name and address.
Minfin wants to prohibit the supplier's storage certificates, so it will allow banks to make their unclaimed contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill prohibiting the depositary certificates to the supplier.
In recent times, this instrument has gained popularity, as well as rates above and in bank contributions.
The fact that the depositary certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system and that the bank is in debt because they do not have to be counted in the Investment Insurance Agency (ASA).
The gravity of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and suffer from Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASV, controls 98 per cent of the profile market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow, estimated by the agency, is approximately 3.5 per cent.
The problem is that clients of a small bank who bought such a certificate are trying to obtain money in the SAV if they call it.
Some depositors, without sufficient financial grammatical grammatical grammatical coverage and the purchase of storage certificates to the supplier, may assume that their inputs are secured.
A reasonable lack of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of a withdrawal of a bank's licence may lead to a lack of understanding and social pressure.
In the Agency ' s practice, cases were made when the administering Powers tried to seek a severe remedy through the court," they said in the ASV.
The problem, of course, is mental.
There will be no one to pay certificates to the buyers, since they have no right to return from the State under the law.
If the instrument was not secured in the ASW, it would be prohibited, along with it, from the metal accounts on which citizens are included in one of the four metal grams of gold, silver, plates and palladium.
These accounts also do not fall into the investment insurance system, but they are still in existence.
The case, most recently, is that the certificates of the supplier are a very nice treasure book, which can actually be expressed in the role of a quasi-deno.
However, their transfer is not in practice controlled: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and may change the number of customers until such a certificate has been obtained.
In no case, the draft legislation stipulates that a storage certificate must be affixed to a book of value which must be kept in the depositary.
In order to submit a pilot to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to an early payment.
That's what the bankers have been thinking about for a long time.
NATO Summit: The First Protests in Newport and Cardiffe
In the past, protests against NATO summit in Newport have taken place.
On Saturday hundreds were gathered at the centre of Newport on the march against NATO.
And on the resurrection day in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff's chariot for what was described as an antisimism.

Germany will send 30 anti-tank kits to Iraq
Germany will send arms to Iraq to combat the combatants from the terrorist group “Islamic State”, reporting on 31 August ITAR-TASS, referring to a decision taken following the meeting of the representatives of the FRG Government in the head with Angelo Merkel Chancelle.
It is reported that Germany will send 30 shipments of anti-tank rockets to Iraq and 500 tanks, as well as 8 thousand G3 and G36 tubes.
Provision will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel would make a statement on this subject in the debate with the Government.
At the same time, Germany did not put its weapons in the hot spots.
The views of the people of the FRG regarding the shipment of arms to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that it is possible to stop the fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that this weapon could eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The commanders were killed by the Ukrainian patrol in the Asian Sea
The Donetian militia killed the Ukrainian patrol in the Asian Sea, reports ITAR-TASS on 31 August.
According to the data available, this occurred in the Taganrog River near the settlements of Shirokino and Iberian (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports the bombing of two coastal shelters.
It is estimated that the incident occurred today about 16:20 msk.
Poisons on the vertigos with the Deep Mountain
A two-year-old boutique was transported to a safe place after they had spent the night in the Deep Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy were on their way shortly after Wednesday at Govets Lip in Black City.
Concerned relatives called the police about 8 nights before they returned home.
A search group was sent to the local police and rescue teams, and a couple were found about 11 evenings around the Bridal Way.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and killed her head.
The officers stayed with the couple at night, and raised them on Monday morning.
They were rushed into the car to help in a stable condition at Blu Mountain Hospital.
Two Unions met
High-level negotiations in Minsk did not solve the problems that had been raised but gave birth to a new format: the first members of the European Union met with the first members of the future Israeli
Let the situation (the situation around Ukraine does not endure), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union first discussed a number of "heavy problems".
Whether such a structure is able to work effectively and smoothly, so it is clear who has taken the slips from this summit.
The issues of this account were raised on the evening of 26 August, when the Belarusians followed, and after them, other Europeans and Europeans appeared on the televisions of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader was an example of outstanding education, a human behavior that was just a jackpot, and plans a decent age in a higher society.
As told by Maidan Lukashenko
The arrival of three key European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak on behalf of the final briefing - not just the legitimization of the President with a 20-year term.
This is a request for the recognition of Minska as a full European policy entity and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analysis of the Belorussian Institute of Strategic Research, Denise Meliancov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak with Minsk the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Eston met a aunt with Lukasenko gives the reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to deteriorate," he said "The Fire".
There is a secret part of this embargo: training by the Belarusian authorities began to take place long before the November Sudan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved and with the EU - successful visa facilitation negotiations and re-admissions, modernization dialogues - are listed by the "fire" associate, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The States even had a few sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, they have only underpinned the process by the Belarus leadership themselves.
The mission, on the one hand, has managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - a sufficient amount of heat so as not to lose heavily in the mutual trade, and President Poroschenko could come to Belarus to negotiate.
The other was a Belarusian leader who did not recognize the accession of Crimea to Russia and called on the proselytism officers in Donbassa to be punished with all their cruelty, and he was not ashamed of Moscow.
Minsk did not leave the Customs Union or the ODCB, but the Russian airport is located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, confirmed by Belarusian experts.
As the Lukashenko movement towards political diversification has been successful, it will often be seen in the EU+TS form in the near future.
In the EU High Representative's office on foreign policy and diplomacy, Catherine Eston could not respond promptly to the questions that Brussels expected from relations in the new format.
The Secretary of the Press, Mr. Eston Maya Kosiyanč, simply stated that the issue of war and peace was not a priority.
It was reported that the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the first persons in the new form could also be held in Kazakhstan.
A statement made by President Nurosultan Nazarbaeva, who acknowledged that he was being called upon personally by the representatives of the Euro-Union.
However, in the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties were not opposed to the fact that Minsk remained a central platform for meetings both in the form of Russia-OBSE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and High Representative of the Eurocommission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" has the status of a fully-armed European leader who helps solve the global problem.
Best friend of the European Farmer
The EU delegation, including the Eurocommissions on Trade and Energy, had already concluded: the summit's main agenda - not the tragic situation in Donbasse, but the economy.
In fact, the planned future negotiations on gas supply and the overcoming of the concerns of the TC countries on the agreement on Ukraine's association with the EU are more important than the peace declarations without specific dates and numbers.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Güht, however, noted: EU representatives "have come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has economic implications rather than the opposite".
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine also "works" in Belarus.
Its consequences - and, firstly, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - are granted to Minsko, who is still experiencing the sanctions imposed on the manoeuvre.
According to the director of the Mission Research Centre, the ex-Candidate in the Presidents of Belarus, Yaroslava Romanchuca, European investors are actively interested in Belarus' ability to supply agricultural products to the FFR in the field of sanctions.
The supply schemes for which Vladimir Putin launched the Minsk summits are being developed.
"Initiators of these schemes, the Romance of the Fire" stressed, not the Belarusian businessmen, but the Russian companies.
They have long developed goods supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
The Russian business needs to be restored, even through the mediation of the Belarusian structures.
Second, the expert continues to believe that many Ukrainian companies have not yet established production in Belarus from the Ukrainian market as well as with the Russian market orientation.
The Ukrainian producers had a net export of $4 billion in Russia, and the Belarusian production and trade schemes could now be very expensive."
In the view of Romania, the role of the EU and the TS field industry is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalled that the EU agricultural sector's losses from Moscow's sanctions were estimated at EUR 5-10 billion, and the Eurocommission has now offered only EUR 125 million compensation to the farmers.
The President of Belarus may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact of Eurofarms.
This may undermine the authority of Lukaschenko in the EU at an unprecedented level.
Non-initiative hospitality
Catherine Eston thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk's active role in the birth of the TS+EU format is open, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the new form was the initiativer and the whole of Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any discussion, not with the boutiques to decide, after the signing of the EU Association Treaty, to discuss the situation that was currently in Ukraine," he referred to the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.
On the other hand, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, in the hearing, was significantly opposed to the media of Minsk, which strongly increases its political momentum.
In the Belarusian diplomatic office, Belarus emphasizes that Belarus does not pursue useful goals in organizing EU and TC activities on its land, but the ultimate aim is to establish a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, particularly in the field of security, are driving and moving towards the leadership of our strategic Union, the Russian Federation," said the "Hogong" in the Belarus MDG, a agency that has recently sculpted words.
In Moscow, there can be areas with paid entrance
The Government of Moscow looks at the introduction of a zone with a paid entrance as a method of combating overloading the central routes of analogy with other major cities of the world, transmits M24.ru with a reference to the Moscow Summit on Transport of Maxim Lixutova.
One of the options that successfully recommended himself is a payroll.
That's an expert opinion, we're obliged to study it, look at all the minutes and plus.
To mention that some decisions have been taken in this regard so far," Lixusu said.
Zammera stressed that for the capital authorities, the experience of Asian cities that resemble the structure and loading of Moscow is very important.
One of the decisions taken by these countries was already being implemented by the construction of the central road road, which was added by Lixuto.
The recent construction of the Central Carway is an example of the fact that not all traffic is required to pass through Moscow.
If there were enough traffic infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," he said.
Maxim Lixusuto also stated that the introduction of the parking lot had significantly damaged the capital streets.
And, he said, the capital authorities are not planning to stay on what they have achieved.
Recall, on 26 August, the Russian capital, Sergei Sobayin, participated in a memorial ceremony for the construction of the first pass of the Moscow Central Road Road (CCD).
Error Parsing
The film Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, "Hord of Sins-2: A woman who deserves to be killed," did not make the revolution that could have been expected of him.
The first "Gold of Sins" (2005), which was removed from the minimum, but symbolic, participation in Quentin Tarantino, made a revolution in relations between cinema, comics and literature.
Sikvel is also more revolutionary: in the sense that it breaks down the fundamental for modern thinking of the "tesis-antithesis-synthesis" (if it is understood under thesis of the universe, and under the anti-aesthetics of the comics).
It should read "thesis-antithesis-haos".
"Gold sin-2" is a haottic and a playwright, and at the philosophical level: both times he is a hatastic in a foolish sense of word.
Yes, part of the hero's name on the first town, though, here, Marv (Micky Rurk), will remember, he finished his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing but succeeds - in the role of such a people's friend - from the air of a knife and other tortoises.
But the old are literally breaking up with the blogs of the news that hit the city from some other film about the meaning and context of which viewers ask for nothing to worry about.
Yes, his story, which was badly loaded by the authors at the most interesting place, is in the superintendent of Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levittt).
It's got a hot-frequency Eve Lord (Eva Green) and something dark about Duyta (Josh Brolin).
But this pultanist, in which Duyta, we say, does not stand out from Johnny - more than people like other parts of the body, suffer from irregularity, not trouble, nor even loss.
It's not people, but we understand that it's a nude archipelago: a year-old bitch, too confident in itself, a game that agreed to a "medie hunting" sex detective, a corrupt super-sanator.
Well, when the archipelago's walsing with the archipelago and the archipelago, it's not a movie anymore, but it's an abstract novel.
And to ask the abstract script questions about the logic of the mixture is simply funny.
Moreover, even in this troubled world, there are things that are not only permanent but also lasting.
The warheads of the first "Golda" continue to protect the circle from those who are under the influence of their own domestic darkness forces.
Yes, and the look of Detective Hartgina isn't, she's looking at a gun, and Bruce Willis's always nice to see.
The main problem of the "Probation of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was well aware that as a dancer, he had a talented combination of comics and neurons, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comex and zero are two aggressive anti-realities.
The phenomenon of comics was born in modern times at the end of the 1920s, when the Roman Dischyl Hammeta, the "Currade of Blood" (1929), the "Maltie School" (1930) and the "Strengthening Key" (1931) created a canon called hard-boiled school, which was then called the "Hard-boiled school".
Come on, pop fiction.
The commissions gave Hollywood dozens of heroes: from the Popaya Sea, the fuel of the spina bonfire that gave him the rich power, Superman, Batman and the scourer Dicka Tracy to Halca, Tora, Chelveska-pouka and other "hires".
But any film on comics was something harmful: the painted personnel did not deliberately want to touch the screen, remained trapped in their wild, "real" world.
I'm just saying, they've been completely deprived of "existence."
On the contrary, the most existential generation of world literature.
After the world war, the traditional novel, with experiences, characters, family scandals, and historical background, lost all confidence.
What Forsyits, which Tybo and Rugon-Makkari, which even the Bolconies and Plants are generally thought to be after Verden, Osvencim and Hiroshima?
Such a novel had a peaceful mood in the form of a fine operation, and the criminal was to determine the marginal -- the novel was elevated to the level of philosophy.
Hammett on his skin knew he was working as a sanatorium on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, they were, at least, close to the company and the columns of the genre, such as the writers Horas Macko and Jim Thompson, director of Jul Dassen, Joseph Louzie, Edward Dmitrick.
That's why the nuance that they gave to the architects, the first, the rough and the Chinese, and the second, is very social.
It's quite an American choice of socrealism.
The first "Gold of Sins" was noted for its opposite nature, but it was organically combined with a nuisance.
At first, the comic book came alive, not with its graphic nature, but with the "current" film.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered a wonderful son-in-law, was quite worthy of the Hammet.
And the vivid details of the kind of cut heads that the farmer deduces his nest, by the genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best - is a declaratively sharp - the neonura.
"Crimson-2" is not even a waste, but the capitalization of the radical style of Miller-Rodridges before the tradition of comics.
Probably because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second "Gold of Sin," you feel trapped in a glass of glass in which the snow covers the playing block.
Besides, it's not always snow, it's blood clots, but what's the difference?
Let's talk about socialism and say something.
It is only when it is possible that somewhere where we sometimes have, let it be on the face of a terrible storm, but there is a normal world where you can go back on the wrong path of a girl or say to your unhappy parents that she is being punished.
When sin entered into the city, and sin entered into the city, and the sin entered into the city, and the law became known.
It's as sweet as any rule.
The House of Sin-2 is just broken.
The justice of the father-in-law contributed to this gross sin a little bit, but a little bit.
The titres warn: there are harmful smoking scenes in the film.
As for the plant, in the very vegetarian episode where man's fingers are cut off, it gives him an adhesion.
The Hammeta would be happy.
French socialists must "stop and bring France in," said the key Union of Frasua Holland
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to “show a warm relationship” against the incoming attacks of the presidential socialist, who had not received approval from the ruling majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty-- stay with him," he said, calling out applause.
As a sincere reconciliation, the Prime Minister was convinced that his Government would not raise the issue of a 35-hour working week in France, despite the ongoing conflict of proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Olland urged his associates on the Socialist Party to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tober, the minister of justice, introduced the ballasts into the classroom, attended a meeting of members of the Socialist Party and criticized the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost faith in the future”.
Marin le Pé, leader of the very right National Front, expressed the view that the ongoing internal conflicts between socialists were not expected to last longer than a few months.
France Holland is the king's head, but the head and prince Manuel Wall, who was forced to collect a new government when it had not been in the past.
"And the new one won't stay dry or dry," said Mrs. Pen to the reporters.
She repeated her call on the party to launch a parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and be ready to run.
France's ruling party has survived the march of municipal elections, and the final right of the National Front has come first to the EU elections in May.
The resurrected Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of French people believed that the Socialist Party was at risk of surviving several opposing factions until the end of the presidential term of Mr. Holland in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician from the University of Sean Po, warned that the French would lose their patience if the new socialist government could not fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has a little time, but the public opinion needs to feel like something changes quickly," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
"The town without drugs" is gone.
The Federal Court of Arbitration left without consideration of the request for the Regional Ministry for the Management of Gastages to the "Gold Without Drugs " fund.
It was intended to raise over 7 million rubs from the organization as rental fees in Ekaterinburg.
However, the defendant did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Arbitration Court of the Sverdlov region has left without consideration of the request of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry for the Management of State Property of the Region (MUGISO) to the Fund for the "Gold Without Drugs" (one of the foundations is Mr. Ekaterinburg Evgeny Roseman).
The representatives of the regional authorities intended to raise 7.3 million rubs as rent payments to the building.
Today it has been known that the defendant has not appeared twice in court, for which a decision was taken to refuse the review.
The lack of representatives of the MUGISO Directorate was unable to explain, and the Chief of the Legal Division, Maxim Titov, did not answer the phone calls.
The Fund was also unable to communicate with representatives.
We remember the fact that the fund was held in the city centre on the streets of Berlin, 19 on a freeboard basis since 2011.
Such a decision was taken by ex-government Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Director of the Ministry of State Management of the Sverdlov area requested the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to remove the building fund.
According to the request, the Office had been required by the court to recognize the inalienable treaty for the free use of the memory facility.
In the opinion of the MUGISO Directive, there were no significant conditions in the agreement for the rental of the cultural heritage.
The Supreme Arbitration Court rejected the search and appealed to the 17th Arbitration Court, which was satisfied.
The same court then filed a cassation appeal against the decision which remained unconstitutional, after which the decision was appealed by the Foundation in the High Arbitration Court, but the court had adopted the direction.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, with the fund reimbursing the rent, which was discussed by the head of the city of Evgeny Roseman.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubs a month.
The previous administration of the area transferred this building to free use, recognizing our duty to combat drugs, in a sign of respect for the Fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatyana Dragaeva, Ekaterinburg
Why Mr. Ekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, Alexander Kosinzev, a member of the Ekaterinburg pride delegation, proposed that the mayor of the city, the speaker of the pride of Ekaterinburg, should go away.
The cause was a criminal case against a suspect arrested in the murder of a retired member of the pride of Olega China, who was considered a partner of the mayor.
How Evgjan Rosman found a criminal case
On 1 July, a criminal case against the fact of "clash" (page 128.1 of the FFR) was heard in Ekaterinburg, Evgen Rosman.
This was reported in the GU IMD on the Sverdlov region, which addressed the relevant statement by the legal director of the Centre for Protection, Anna Filatov.
In her statement, Mr. Roseman accused her in his blog that she was involved in crimes committed by her ex-wife.
Mr. Ekaterinburg is convinced that "it's a real attempt to deny the truth."
iPhone is turning into a shell
In advance, on 9 September, when Apple had to submit its new drafts, all new reports were made on what could be expected from the presentation.
With reference to American media sources, it is reported that the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile shell as a result of the joint Apple project and the Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet Re/code, Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express on 9 September on new products, which will result in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
Companies themselves reject any comments in this regard.
This function enables you to pay for the store casse by using the smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be performed by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will first set up NFC (ner field communication) technology, which will allow for a wireless payment using the smartphone and the appropriate cassette device.
NFC will itself be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
The first NFC function was presented in 2004 in cooperation with Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than one hundred other companies that came into the so-called NFC Forum.
The first telephone with the NFC was issued by Nokia in 2006.
Android's first smartphone with NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet system to enable users to link bank cards to their Google account and to pay with the aid of the Android smartphone.
In addition, American experts point out that, despite large investments by high-tech companies in NFC technology, American rivalries are still cautious about innovation and do not spend too much money on the equipment of their stores on such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple’s entry into this market will make it easier and more effective to implement this technology in its trading points.
IMD France: Paris’s position on supply in Russia “Mistriary” has not changed
The official representative of the IMD from France, Roman Nadal, said that Paris had been in constant position on the supply of "Mistral" helicopters to Russia.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (France) in the newspaper Le Monde of 20 August: "The level of sanctions today is not a barrier to supply.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France," Mr. Nadala "RIA News".
The representative of the French Foreign Policy Office thus answered the question of whether the situation in Ukraine had been reduced to a change in Paris ' s position to implement the contract.
For more information on the shipments of helicopters in Russia, please read the article "Ogonek" "Mistral" in the magazine almost ours.

Norwegian Cruise is close to $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
The Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the end of the negotiations for the acquisition of a similar Prestige Cruises International Inc company of approximately $3 billion, according to the people who are aware of the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cross-border courts and Prestige Cruises, as it competes with larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (CL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement may already be announced this week, the sources have been notified in the resurrection, warning that negotiations can still be broken.
Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
The sources were asked to remain anonymous, as negotiations were not open.
The representatives of the Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not object to the request to comment when the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, manages 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.

Advance companies are trying to position themselves as cross operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered in the United States governing bodies for the first public place of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the major shareholder of the company after the $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000, as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and casinos under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.

In Mincomas, Russia proposes to allocate 250 million rubs to the State Telecom Company in 2014.
According to the Mincomas draft resolution on the single portal for information on the preparation of regulatory acts, the subsidy is planned to “depend on the cost of creating conditions for the wide-ranging awareness of the social and economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.

Activists of the Democratic Movement of Hong Kong violate the statement by the Chinese representative the following day after the election decision
A group of citizens, loyal to Beijing, stood near the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the Council of Peoples of the Swiss Confederation on the Day of the Resurrection defined the procedure whereby two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the elections of the Hong Kong leadership in 2017.
All candidates should begin to receive support from the majority of members of the Committee on Migration, which is likely to be a pool of Afghan loyalists.
The decision made almost impossible for the democratic opposition to the electoral budget and forced the democratic movement activists to promise again to stop the Hong Kong financial centre by the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of pressure in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will be extended to other cities.
Following the publication of the Beijing document describing China's control over Hong Kong, in June, democratic activists conducted an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands entered the city centre and set up a seating stop.
Bryfing Li is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Association of Peoples of the Czech Republic, Jung Rongson, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Office and the Feng Wei State Council, were also required to address the briefings during the day.
Activists said they would meet at the head of the Government of Hong Kong in the second half of the day.
Britain has not forgotten the democratic governance of Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 grams of land belonging to the Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities declared their intention to join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, which belongs to the Palestinian autonomy.
According to Bi-bi-si, the decision to join South Wi-Fi is related to the desire to pay for the theft and murder of three Israeli adolescents in June this year.
The Ministry of Defence of Israel announced on the occupied territory in the resurrection and instructed the military to establish administrative management on the west coast.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip Saiba Arica, the world community should call Israel ' s response to the “continuous activity in the West Bank of Jordan and in East Jerusalem”.
Putin calls on Kiev to start negotiations on "State" in eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the Ukrainian Government to stop fighting with the separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately to start negotiations on "statement" in the region.
His secretary, Dmitry Peskov, explained later that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be revised in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, the call for Putin to the Kuwaiti Government to start negotiations with the proselytism rebels was equal to the obvious strategy that it should start bleeding five months ago: Help the separatists remove the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly announced territory of Novorossia an actual independence to approach Russia rather than to the West.
During the State First TV Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the occupied separatists to the eastern Donec and Lugan areas, which were held in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Kram 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territories of New Russia, or New Russia, as the name that leads to the revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peaceful negotiations will occur in the near future when Ukrainian policies launch a campaign to parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in the occupied separatists, the “Aluminium pillar” reported ITAR-TASS.
“We must immediately start substantive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political system of society and the state of South-East Ukraine, in order to comply with the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that the words of Putin on State had been in the context of greater autonomy, which had been discussed for months with the leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fear in the Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the East region the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The involvement of the Secretary-General of Crimea to correct the word “unbeliever interpretation”, Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to commit itself to separatism in the east in a way other than the open arrest of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to hold a much more difficult fight to join even the Danube and the Lugan region of eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants were non-Russian, and discussions had shown widespread support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine before the start of the conflict.
The autonomy that the Russian diplomats had discussed at international forums would give regional Governments in Ukraine the authority to define trade agreements and foreign policy, in fact, by transferring the Crimea actual control over the territory that would unite the main territory of Russia with the Crimea.
A major Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime agencies and historical maritime corridors, is located on the Black Sea Peninsula, joined five months ago.
In the regions between the Russian Russian area and the Crimea there are also shacks, factories and lithiumes that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Pedro Poroschenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, following the new elections, should bring about amendments to the constitution allowing regions to have greater control over their finances and the status of their languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from the view of Kremlin and the rebel separatists, in the arms and in the attacks against Moscow.
The last call for Putin to Kiev to agree with the separatist leaders, as well, followed by the new arrivals of rebels last week after the Russian army and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from before the peaceful area near the Asian Sea.
Russian-supported separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk as follows by Ukrainian security officers saying that it is the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea itself.
This has resulted in large civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between the Novosova and the remote crossing of the Crimean Peninsula.
The meeting of the leaders of the European Union in Brussels was scheduled on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was 23 years old.
"We're approaching the point of non-voting," Poroschenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be taken in the event of a Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovakia after two columns of Russian bronchiologists and 1,000 soldiers had arrived in the Danube region last week to support the challenges experienced by the separatists, Colonel Andri Lisenko, Secretary-General of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, reported to the reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers who, according to the evidence, were detained in Ilovakia as a result of the Russian invasion, were replaced by 10 Russian planes caught in the Ukrainian territory last week.
The scandal with the alleged photos captures Australian dignitaries and Gaby Greco
Jeffery Edelstein expressed his rejection of the hackers who may have stolen his famous photos of Gabi Greco and the entire list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood, after a number of opened photographs on which Jennifer Laurents was exposed, was exposed to the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with nominalities.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 open photos of the Golden Games star Laurents and superstars, including Kate Apton and Kara Delevin's models, Rianas, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and Kirsten Danst's actress.
The Australian actors Terez Palmer, Emily Brahn, Ivonn Strahovski and the residents of Melbourne Greece were also alleged to have stolen photos as a result of the iCloud escape.
In list 101, name of the nominee.
Edelstein, who made a Greek proposal last month, told Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private records and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greece, which is located in New York, said the news website that the hacker attack was "sustained" and that those to whom it was sent " feel that they have entered it."
It is estimated that there are 30 photos of Palmer with an ex-Bifred Scott Speedman, including two frames, where she is in the pool with a broken chest.
Palmer's work in the movie includes "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chack" Strawovski and the actress of the "Conventional arrest" Brajn yesterday didn't comment on stolen photos.
The representative of Laurence said to the TMZ: "It's a forced entry into private life."
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his disappointment at the hacker's address, writing on Twitter: "To print photos stolen from the mobile phone, in fact, nothing is different from the sale of stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't wait to publish stolen photographs.
Found a potential way to steal the photos of the entitled enigma
The mass flow of the star's accounts may be caused by vulnerability in the Annex to the Find My Phone.
The potential scenario for the development of events described the resource The Next Web.
The Github resource has been published in the Python language script, which allows you to choose a password for the Apple Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the iPhone location.
The same login and Apple ID are used for accessing the Apple iCloud cloud, from which they were stolen by name photographs.
The script enabled a test method to detect the password from Find My Phone.
In this way, possible combinations of symbols began with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the number of password options entered was unlimited in the Find My Phone service.
In the proper organization of the security system, after several failed attempts, the account must be blocked and reported to the user about the breach.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to pass the password to their account.
Hackers learned the Apple ID password and used it to access iCloud.
According to the Twitter user Hackapp, vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a written password selection program was written to it.
At this point the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource was linked to the user Hackapp and he noted that the above vulnerability was characteristic of many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability was used for access to the "star" account.
It's not me, plz RT.
In Twitter, the Prime Minister's foreign records appeared on a regular basis.
Although there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability to the film was used in the Find My Phone, it was already very harmful to the use of this service.
The hackers reopened the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In the case, Apple claimed that in this case, cloud security was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, too, the Prime Minister of RF Dmitria Medvedev had also been injured earlier.
If the offenders had access to the iCloud described above, the password could also be stored there for the account of the Head of Government in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource failed to obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability to Find My Phone.
Putin granted the Russian citizenship of the Ukrainian Five Borough
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted the Russian citizenship to a known Ukrainian sporter, Anne Burjak.
The relevant order is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, sport moved to Russia to a permanent place of residence and called on the Federation of Contemporary Friday to allow it to speak for a meeting of the RF.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won a silver medal for a European champion in private and became a champion of peace in a mixed estaphat, which is one of the new types of sport.
It maintains leadership positions and in the current season.
According to the rules for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, it will need special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian sportsman to change citizenship.
In July Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to the Chachamatist Ekaterine Lagno, a levo, which is a two-time European champion (2005), the world close to the 2010 and fast chess (2014).
As a team of women, Ukraine became the winner of the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the World Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Championship in Warsaw (2013).
SCR terminated the investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Vukovo
The next Committee of Russia (SCR) terminated the criminal case because of the accident of the Tu-204 Red Wings aircraft.
This is reported by the press office.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the command of the aircraft and the shipowner.
The judicial expert showed that the cause of the disaster had increased the rate of landing, the failure of standard landing procedures, and the unintended output of motor vehicles to high-speed traffic.

Alexander Emlyanenko started training in SISO
A well-known Russian combater of the 33th-year-old mixed-style, Alexander Emlyanenko, who was in SIZO on charges of sexual violence against his or her employer, was completely relieved of the injuries and started training.
That's what "Campionat" reports about.
In May this year, the Russian Follow-up Committee accused Alexander Emelianco of rape.
The above-mentioned investigation revealed that on 9 May, he was detained in Tambow after a road transport incident that resulted in the outbreak of the plague.
Emeliyanko-youngs was arrested until 31 August and was sentenced to trial on 1 September.
However, the court was transferred, resulting in an extension of the term of detention until 30 September.
In case a sportsman's fault is proved, he will be sentenced to six years in prison.
What power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emlyanko's career.
His last unit was Emelianenko in January of the current year, losing Dmitry Sosnovsky's technical nephew.
Alexander is the younger brother of a more famous fighter, Fedora Emelianenko.
The last is a four-fold world champion on mixed war experiences, a four-fold world champion, and a Russian semi-arid champion on the battlefield.
Violence was the most universal and functional human emotion
The person's heart expression is biologically universal to humanity, and not everyone involved in its creation of a body and a group of muscles is present, but is an additional means of expressing power and threats, explained by Australia and the United States.
They have discussed their findings in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavio and can read about them in the press release of the California University in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the person who was shot and shot down in the bottom of the thick line of the cave, which was thrown out of all cultures, and made him even blind from the birth of a child who had never seen him, was noted by the leading author of the study, Aaron Sel.
Within the framework of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has emerged for the effective conduct of conflicts during the conflict.
The more physical damage a person can cause to another, the more he is able to dictate his circumstances, the more he will bring it to the offender with the help of anger.
Researchers have also found another of their hypothetical assumptions: physically strong people are more concerned and more prone to abuse, feel themselves entitled to impose other adverse conditions on them, and prefer violent ways of resolving conflicts peacefully.
Apart from the fact that anger is, above all, “the emotion of trade”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that create a hearty expression of the person should represent the more powerful and dangerous person in the eyes of the spouse, and thus allow them to act as quickly as possible in order to avoid conflict.
In order to verify this hypothese, researchers modeled on the computer of the person where each of the seven elements of the angry person was present or missing and showed them to the informants.
Although the injured limbs or the victim's injuries were not necessarily a person of evil, the more powerful physical participants in the study were unanimously recognized by the person represented by such persons.
Man's anger, as in animals, poses a threat: an overexpression of his own strength, which forces him to accept and obey.
A man spreads his noses and raises his teeth for the same purpose as a lagoose who hopes, or a queen who demonstrates her feelings.
"Genov " is abandoned by the spouse's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately accepts the form that will demonstrate the most effective opposite side of the effect of the rejection.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same," notes anthropologist John Tuby.
