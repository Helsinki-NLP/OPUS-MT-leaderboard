He's already a hundred.
It's about life and death.
Surprisingly, the Iranians, who had the Islam defeated the Arab military route, became his most violent observers - forced to cross the Zoroastris, although it was their father's religion. Something like Stockholm's syndrome in the entire nation.

It's their only choice.
It's for drugs.
It's too hot for me.
It's true he's young, but he has a lot of meaning.

That's better.
It's great to meet you.
It's hard to believe.
It's hard to eat just one piece of cake.
It's hard to say what Tom's going to do.

This isn't just about money.
It's not my fault!
It's not sensitive.
It's not like I don't like to play, I just don't have time.

That's up there.
It is very easy to play naturally in your native language and very easy to play in a native.
In the event of an emergency, it is important to maintain blood.
It's nice of you to help me.
It's very likely to be chosen.
It's unlikely he's the same man you met 10 years ago.
It's pretty likely you'll see the horse here.
It's very unlikely.
