Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will be involved in Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American President of the history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
It will be reimbursed for its extraordinary efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House as well as his wife Michelle will be landing in the Norwegian Metro tomorrow and will have a programme.
He will first attend the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee chosen in October among 172 persons and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will find its sum in the afternoon at a Sunday ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth American President to receive it, but only the third to see the price falling within the Committee's own indent.
The White House announced that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the time of the award.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he receives this price by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the present time.
It reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of its critics would forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million euros).
He is responsible for giving charity works, but he has not yet specifically decided those.
Her program was then held by her husband at a banquet including the king and queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reticent at this price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, that he did not feel worthy of it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he said it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defendant of the accused nature of singing
The Litomérice Police accused the president of the Litomérice Association of Protection of the Nature of Litomérice.
Several times in the last year, he called for several construction singing procedures and demanded the money from the investors for his personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, the police spokesman of Lithuania.
The President of the Society for the Protection of the Nature of Lithuania is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk of imprisonment for up to three years.
Three-thirds of waste are not in perfume in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks packs, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on triangular lines to each side of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before you find the right legs.
I don't mean we wouldn't choose all the wastes in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the age of stone of three wastes not only because citizens can still choose only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of bees devoted to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It's all a science, which requires especially time and oxygen nerves.
The only place I found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Portefena Husa.
That Mr. Anderka and his colleagues don't want me, but I don't think so.
Without talking about the fact that in other districts of the city it's not a non-synecure anymore.
So to end, many of my friends don't take their losses.
Looks like it.
It makes them proud to reach their knees.
That's not surprising to me.
I myself, after a party, proposed to throw some bottles of wine and PVC.
Except I didn't see any color line Kounicova.
Fortunately, I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That's what the wastes were going to go through.
It's after all the center of Brno, who's supposed to be the best city, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and a claim to aesthetics are not of much interest to the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy in the city a place in the first hockey link that honors the city all over the country, instead of buying some extra beers and offering the three-fold increase of primary materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after having spent some time on the Internet.
According to ECO-KOM company data, Brno is really the worst in the South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has benefited from pensions and sickness leave
After the left has increased, despite the Government's opinion, farmers or officials may lack money for retirement, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest in the debt of the State or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of the next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social-democrats and communists imposed an increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive expenses, retirements or sick leave. "It is only to solve the problems later, reduce the land," Janato said.
It is important to know that the interest paid on money is higher and that it will need to be repaid sooner or later.
The State does not really have the choice to know where to get the money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those on the left has now increased: pumpers, institutes, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and have no fear for their withdrawals or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a bigger state - the next year it will not miss 163 billion in cash, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janotota, the debt will grow faster and with it, expenditure related to interest.
The State will need money to repay it and it will no longer be sufficient to gradually increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficiency package.
It will also lack five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to some electoral groups.
This is mainly due to already decided and estimated trends which cannot be modified to reduce any costs.
As a matter of fact, it's not free anymore.
This means delay or halting 30 large cities, and the removal of European funds is also in danger, according to the maintenance of Karel Hanzelka, the port of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD proposed to address the financial deficit very rightly - it will be put in the ČEZ dividends (Energy Supplier and Distributor), which the State has most of it and will feed the transport funds.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it does not happen in any case without a background.
Last year, this is 18 billion which have been sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to complete retirement accounts, or to reserve for the reform of the pensions that they are preparing.
In addition, this deficit increases the actual deficit of the budget of 5.7 per cent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from being the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crimes, including housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we forgive an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save the department's side or, in the worst case, touch the Government's budget reserve.
There is also a lack of 100 million in the State cache project of a value of two billion, which must be made available online to monitor the expenditure of each administration.
The first stage will take place in January.
If the Minister of Finance had no money, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are looking at a mobile phone that will allow the user to pass from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that were revealed appeared promising.
It's enough for a button and you pass Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely this opportunity that is the objective of the American company VMware, which is primarily involved in developing virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can change between them, you can distinguish them personally and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware company in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of the last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones does not reflect any of the fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the above-mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is very serious.
VMware now cooperates with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices in 2012.
The snowfall in the mountain tracks the hotel
The desert trails pose no problem except for the foot-and-mouth operators.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their stay on ski in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to detonate free rooms for all winter dates, including Noël and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our website.
Internet users cover offers, asking for prices but are not obliged to book for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or snow in Noël," said Martin Jandura, exploiting the Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of its dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate to book.
If it is given priority to the economy and the quality of the accommodation is only followed, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hotels offer only one week's stay for the New Year.
I think they'll try again for a while to please them, but they'll also cut them and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly decrease," Jandura loved.
The Intours Tourism Agency of Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Noël's week is most interested in us for the moment, it's not completely sold.
It still remains free, say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared a few days of Christmas for the last minute less expensive," said Ingrours Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also propose the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The fourteenth days of February are going well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter days was negatively influenced by the fact that there has always been no snow in Krkonoše.
People expect her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the snow-free mountain.
If the tracks are recovered during the week, Noël will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
On the contrary, the employment of the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Snžkou is slightly higher in the last year.
We have an improvement of almost five percent.
It remains a few last places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of Janvier des Polnais and February, too," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the central park of Jánské Lázní is also full of twenty-five percent during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain alive in Noël in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázní.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already had six percent of employment at the present time.
February is a little lower for the moment, but since the snow is falling, interest for the stay in the Krkonoše will still grow, of course, indicated the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkonoše hotels, however, do not have to expect more snow.
Thursday will make it more expensive and if there are any precipitation, they should be naked in the mountains.
However, the time should then be reduced, reports Jirí Jakubský of Hradec Station of the Czech hydrometric Institute.
United States: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
He also became a comical character, the one with which Barack Obama, President of the reputation of wisdom, re-produces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which he considered to be very simple.
When he finished leaving his doctrine to pass on to him, he found that he had collected it in the carbon paper since the Iraqi Bush scenario three years ago.
It is not happy to use the phrase "as in Iraq" in the text several times, it is not reluctant to use the title of the speech of Bush in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new strengths into a civil war-consuming Iraq as "responsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
However, the following months have shown that Bush's strategy, which followed the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely success in that the current newspapers do not speak of all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that is, objectively speaking, left his successor a much more favourable final situation than we could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will be played
This is again the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even strongly criticised the trends of the White House despite the subordination habits.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The President was angry for three months, but, in the absence of a better option, at least the general of 10,000 soldiers was excommunicated.
It has succeeded in eliminating the promise of 5,000 additional Europeans, even though it initially accounted for 10,000.
What brings the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw Afghanistan's armies 18 months ago and end all of this process for three years. Obama's doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase in half will bring the same results as progress in Iraq.
Despite the brutal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders respect the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - it cannot be relied on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their leadership day by day according to their arrangements.
The political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only in the dust behind which ethnic patriot relations will be extended.
It is simply difficult to balance the interests of various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complex by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "promoting state", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy makes its volunteerism very popular.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made use of and is currently on the coast of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be assured that the little soldiers sent to the battle tower for their "prompt return to the house" will come here with a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible because the Taliban will consider it to be the indirect possession of the American deficit.
The latest NATO summit showed that the desire of Europeans to participate in the military operations in Afghanistan is a negative one.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iranians, Americans will face the most difficult issue of a solution to the problem by resorting to military force.
For example, it will have to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will return to the victorious retreat of the Afghan troops.
However, each such solution will result in a dramatic return to the Afghan situation.
The only Russian for Obama is that he remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore he still has enough time for him to go on a new strategy, where he would be a total gasco.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers will no longer receive cash prizes
The high-ranking employees of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premiums in species.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticisms about its wage practices.
The group of 30 main leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to repay five years ago.
Actions may be withdrawn from the leaders if they take too much risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus in charge of the effort to link returns with long-term performances in Wall Street.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning it has to take, said Douglas Elliott's former investment banker from JPMorgan.
The concern is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the target of criticism after it has been set aside nearly $17 billion for prizes on the first three trimesters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the coming of the financial crisis, the strong premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
The United Kingdom announced Wednesday that it would affect a single rate of 50 per cent of the bankers' bonus over 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have received Nobel Prizes in all areas of physical harm
These are five women, a number of records, who have received today in Stockholm of the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave Nobel Prizes in technical and literary disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, received with their partner Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical price was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonathan with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to clarify the structure and function of the ribsosoms
The last laureate received the Nobel Prize for Economics, American Elinor Ostrom and his partner Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that wasn't fun this year was physics.
This price has been awarded to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD puzzles, which are currently based on all digital cameras, fax or astronomical moons.
Each laureate received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the financial reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (about EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them bears several laurels, they will share the reward between them.
The so-called Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the nature of his reward because it was only at the beginning of his course and that he was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
He added that in some situations war is necessary to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited her to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janato tomorrow, who will take his seat in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for the next year as he was voted by the House of Members
We believe that the budget and perhaps Janota's position at the office will be at the end of the day of your meeting on Friday.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the crisis of public finances.
This is the speech of President Radim Ochvat, who informed the meeting.
Janato wants to discuss his work Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget that will be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the House of Members validated the proposals for the right to money transfers and increased the remuneration of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the proposals made by the democratic society that they would indirectly increase the deficit of the budget.
For this reason, a violent misunderstanding was born between the right of one party, the government, Klaus and the right of the other party, and the disagreement that resulted in the future of the Fischer Cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Greens Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by the Members, deletes the package of economic measures passed by by the Government of Fischer and that it is expected that the state will end.
Klaus, who is able to ratify the State budget law but is not obliged to do so, said today in a small day of discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long ignored the "severe problem" of the "repealable deficit" of public finances.
Now there is no favourable solution, he says.
Only a strong government could bring about improvements, if it could support a consensus of larger political parties, according to the President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget was in decline and that the government should re-exist on account of its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is no longer evident.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "strategic Verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolanek, saying that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by the former Government of Topolanek is rising and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already, the ČSSD has successfully ratified the State budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the major roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu will show the world a lot of things about the country, its battles and its winners.
The story speaks of sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor who won the Oscars, filmed the life of Nelson Mandela, who fought the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it was a Mandela, a 14-year-old woman who asked him to take her to the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to take you in, I should be able to see you personally..
The age-six-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in the play Million Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of the box, for example, incarnate the leader of a movement against slavery became his own slave, a president of the U.S. fiction, even seeing God in the film Evan All-Powering but never one of the more alive and so important for as many people as Mandela is.
The former South African state man has been imprisoned for 27 years for his work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invasive and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henry published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true history of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and of the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The president Mandela has recently chosen to know that his country remains and is still divided racially and economically after the separation.
He is forced to unite his people by sport and decides to join the Ruby players who are among the world's outsiders.
The South African team will end up making progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to get Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in approaching it most of the reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be in college before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to close his hand.
I realized that when I shut your hand, I'll get your energy back, she'll deliver it, and I'd have the impression of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the capital of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the middle of the rugby.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I dreamed at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, "I've got a lot bigger in the film."
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus, under the lead of the Eastwood realiser, received positive opinions and it was even talked about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very real film."
In film evaluations on the Rottentotoes.com site, Invictus received 76% of positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians were trying a merger
We have been able to observe a strange strange phenomenon of origin unknown above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized that yesterday had tested an intercontinental intercontinental ballistic fussis not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" kind of mission, which had to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the cover of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in the merger tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the pilot flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't get involved, or she got in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as a "missile that doesn't want"
A mystery that doesn't want but that shines
This 13th test was usually started.
It's only at the end of the flight that there's been another drop on the device.
It is clearly the engine of the third stage of the fusada that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" was involved in the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can only be used to fire a ship in motion and mixed
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by a flying object not specifically identified has certainly been a defective "Bulava".
The rest, the Norwegians have not doubted the fact that it is a Russian fuss.
The generals argue that this time, we can't speak out of shame.
The first two stages of the fusion were resistant, and the ovaries were affected only by the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were aware of failure on the first floor.
Although none of the attempts have been made without delay, the Department of Defence's management considers that only six out of 30 had failed.
This rate of success of almost 50 per cent is therefore complex with the generals of optimism and therefore they always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear waves of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a contract for a year at 51 years with the Moscow CSKA
The legendary advocate Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a 51-year professional match.
The former champion of the world, the Olympic champion and the Stanley Cup holder will hand-in-hand his team of the Moscow CSKA in need and will probably make his entry during the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fatissov, who completed his career in 1998 at the age of forty, is the President of the CSKA for the time being.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we need another defender.
Fatissov regularly enters and is willing to help the team.
We still have to sort out some details on the form, say the team's coach Sergey Nymtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified if the comeback of the hockey player's legend is only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nymtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and received 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous fifth Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union, he twice spent the gold on the Olympics, seven World Championships, he triumphed on Canada Cup as well as on the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected the Homages in NHL where he twice held Stanley Cup.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the temple of the renowned hockey.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all extra hours
The management of the Nošovice Hyundai plant agreed with the unions to cancel all additional hours.
This is precisely because of the frequent extra hours the unions have declared a state of emergency Monday.
Peter Vanék's speech from Hyundai's village confirmed it.
However, the management wishes to continue to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday that still worked this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, it is essential, because additional additional hours have been proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there were two teams, Vanék said.
The website Sedmička.cz indicated that the company proposed 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be assigned to the post office for the day of work on 28 November.
The company, according to Vanék, decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Whether they receive the supplement for the additional hours, or they can put a replacement leave on December 28th, and extend their final holidays of the year indicated by Vanék.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for breakfast.
Given that additional hours were the hottest and hottest point in the comments and applications of trade unions as employees who had suddenly stopped production last week, the Director decided immediately to cancel all additional hours for December, Vanék said.
Up to the last week, the car's employees were forced to work almost two extra hours a day in addition to their eight hours.
The trade unions shall cancel the strike status after signature of the agreement.
The following negotiations between the driving of the vehicle and the trade unions must take place after noon.
The union leader Petr Kucharí said that they were ready to cease the strike if they agreed on their claims and signed a common document.
The situation in the vehicle ended last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees were spontaneously injured because of insufficient extra hours.
They also protested against the bad conditions of pay and claims to be taxed.
The direction was defended by the fact that employees had to work in addition to complementing car production imperatives.
In the announcement of Monday's strike, the unions also requested that employees who had ceased production be subject to no sanctions.
The trade unions call for the company to reduce the time spent in additional hours at least.
In addition, this year they want a refund of 5 000 crowns (209 € about) for them.
The vehicle Hyundai de Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It launched the production in series last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles up to September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that works on HIV "permanent" viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists tested new combinations that can slow the proliferation of HIV virus in the body.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also applies to viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This fact, in some cases, is based on the fact that the combination does not affect the current variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
However, the life of patients can be radically extended through a combination of medicines that prevent the proliferation of HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption has a number of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has led to the development of what is called resistant viruses that no longer have any effect on drugs.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to face the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that metallocarbon substances act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are a mixture of wood, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of viruses in a different way from all medicines used so far and is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
Researchers are working to discover new "improved" substances based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their links to the proteins of the virus.
The metallocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two layers of multiple pairs are formed by wood, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A treatable and resistant virus.
HIV protein is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV virus caused by HIV protease, there would be no birth of infected particles measured by the virus.
If HIV is stopped, the spread of virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, explaining the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of boxes (cf. table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A bit weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in trials as well as in its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
In the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarbons is not as strong as clinical medications, but it does not decrease in resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
The metalocarbons, with their unique action mechanism and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to consider further to guide themselves towards the development of effective anti-AIDS medicines, says Pavlína Rézečová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the organic chemistry and biochemistry Institute and the molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS takes them to Fischer, which defends themselves.
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek, has appointed the budget ratified for the following year and he says that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should re-examine its existence.
The Prime Minister qualified for the ODS for drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyze.
The ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens Party was not clearly functioning anymore.
According to Nečas, the head of the Government should decide to take part in the House of Members in support of the minority who are concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in his office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the democratic society in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Members has ratified the budget for 2010, however, with proposals for changes of up to 12 billion lines including the left.
The House increased the money allocated to employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's response to the proposals of democratic society was the fact that it was indirectly increasing the deficit of the budget.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion dollars.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the Government's will as a modified budget is a smaller variable than an interim budget.
Deceptiveness and inefficiency
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a feeling of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
It is not surprising that if Janota threatened to leave his functions in the event of ratification of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota took your first day with the Prime Minister after his visit to the government:
He indicated at the same time that he was asked if he would remain in his duties.
Its rejection of the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decided to continue to fight budgetary deficits, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed budgetary changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly that he will be released if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness insurance, retirement, or the reform of the service law.
Topolanek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in charge.
It's the case of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, highlighted Topolanek in a text communication from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of some departments claim to be TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decided to give up his resignation in the fight against public finances deficit, "it is all logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in the House."
This is not to expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and once it's on the agenda then I'm going to confess, I've been told from the House to the journalists, Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
First Minister Fischer sent in the afternoon for a debate by the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS took a step back to the Prime Minister's request.
At the same time, it was pointed out that the ODS would probably have voted in favour of the modified budget if it had not specifically requested democratic Members to allow the vote on the budget.
We have no feeling of being orphan, we are not small children, we have an answer to the question of whether the ODS had not been brought up by the President of the Party to the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I didn't notice that my vote would have failed.
I knew already when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the months to come would be the House's bunkering and the destruction of everything that was positive, Topolanek would react in person.
According to the new hours of the ČD, there will be less trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December some of the less-charged or regional trains and will strengthen them against some others.
The total coverage of transport will be reduced by the date of entry into force of the new two per cent hours compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic rates and the tariff will be reduced.
These are, for example, the residents of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the ways of making a pendolino branch will run.
On the contrary, an expression ceased to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less quick trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transport concerns Hradec Kralové region of eight per cent in total, in contrast to Prague and its environment, can result in an increase.
Two nights trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the movement of some trains expressed on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to just a few days a week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct Milovice line in Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko bathing system, whose opening is possible through the completion of the electricitying of the line between Lysa nad Labem and Milovice.
The remote lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nadraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains for Šumperk/Jeseník will start at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13th.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million additional rails.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Department of Transport and will be sent to the Roads next year in any four billion lines to manage visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion in the next year, knowing that the State will participate at least three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have again signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration has always been one year.
The Roads of Action appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not benefited from an increase in the price of the vast majority of transport titles.
The changes will affect only the tickets of a day ČD Net and the internet tickets reduced eLiška.
For passengers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the road trajectory, while until then it was valid among the cities of a chosen region and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
The Philippines's rebellion continues to hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels took 75 people to the south of the Philippines today, including some students from a primary school and their institutes.
It's the AFP agency who informed it, but spoke to the 65-day source only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the institutes.
The arrest took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human buggers in an escape from the police.
Local negotiators were now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Philippines Communist Party (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first continued the prosecutions due to violence in a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The marriage law was declared in the province of Magindano in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre, there were 30 journalists in the government's elections.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Apatuan, patriarch of the influential line of the Apatuans.
The Mindanao island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they have renewed peace talks with the government of the Philippines on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns the whole world, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film at Clint Eastwood arrives in American rooms in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech title is Invictus: Neporažéné), and it tells a part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the combatant against the world-known apartheid came back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to take it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the rooms, the returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
He was born on June 18, 1918, in Mégéu, South Africa.
In 1988 he obtained Sakharov's prize for his freedom of thought, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize at Klerk's side.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is fully prepared for the collapse of the football world, and on the other hand because the media are alarmed by new concerns about the increase in racial conflict and discrimination among the people of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are currently rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations expressed to the main roles of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film by renouncing his own terms.
I've been dreaming of this role for years, and I've been well prepared.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally this evening to be able - as it is said - to recover his energy, he indicated during the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remind ourselves through the film of Mandela's personality and message.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but that is what each individual wanted.
Import the email from the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin is the title that is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the part that gave his creation to the people, he represents the South African human rights defender during his presidency.
Thus, Morgan Freeman is trying to collect two racial groups of a long-term divided population, as well as Nelson Mandela, in 1995 he was among the national mail of the South African team on the world's football field, which South Africa had then won.
In order to be shown about the powder in mellot, which is considered to be in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long ovated for fourteen years mainly from the white public and was recognized by the white people.
We hope that the football champion will be able to reunite people in one nation, said the rugby Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to see whether the situation in South Africa is going to improve.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical as has recently been entrusted with an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a fan of rugby who has gone to Great Britain.
The campaign begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of flames in the Louny region
A fire included a transformer from the company Čeps from the distribution centre near the municipality of Víškov in Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the port of the Ustí pumps, there are six units operating on fire.
They wanted to let the transformer consume themselves, but they revised their opinion and invented fire with a mixture of water, mouse and special substance.
The cause is a technical deficit, an internal circuit of the transformer.
No one has been hurt, and according to Paula Mandátova's spokesman, the incident does not endanger the safe functioning of the whole transmission.
The damage is estimated to be a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact number may be known once the fire is burned.
According to Mandátova, the destructive transformer will have to be replaced by a nine.
It adds that in ten years of activity, the company Čeps has not known anything similar and that the incidents of this type are isolated.
The supply of electricity has not been interrupted, saying ČEZ's spokesman for the North Boheme of Sonâ Holingerova Hendrichova, the operation of fires, administrations and industries has not been affected by the fire of the transformation station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator on the Czech territory of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission sets and electric lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution posts with 67 transformers transferring electricity from transport to distribution sets and line tracks of a length of 4339 km.
Jančura will complain for diffamation against three prefects of ČSSD
Radim Jancura, owner of Student Agency, will present today a complaint against three democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Haszek of the South Moravia region, Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region, and against the chief of the Olomouc region Martin Tesarík.
Jancára indicated it in the Dvacet minutes of RadioJournal.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to exploit regional railway routes in some regions.
However, all regions have ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked and claimed that we made the ends of the mouth, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more loving than the ways to make Czechs what is not true because we know the prices of Czechs that have been signed last week.
So he's more than just defending us.
It is in exchange for the colleges on the Student Agency, Jancura said in Radiojournál.
He also indicated that there was evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We will prepare a complaint for this for the European Commission.
Haszek believes that Mr. Jancura's complaint deposit is the result of his media show that serves him for free advertising for his company and for his person.
I am very willing to defend my name and the name of my region and call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be the opportunity to make it clear that it is just Mr Jančura who manipulates the public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Haszek.
Jančura has already reported last week that he will invest a few million crowns in a publication that will mention the disadvantages of the regions.
He said to Radiojörnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he would take it back after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign would mean corruption in a broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the region agreed to entrust the Roads to Czech railways with a command of approximately 150 billion railways without issuing tenders.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to the threat of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop it, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, and I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name, Jančura said today in RadioJournal.
Vaccination against pneumococals will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococals will reverse the old habits of January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voting is already taking place, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals occur.
The pharmaceutical institution has already defined the maximum rates for vaccines that will pay sickness insurance.
Specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococas.
The condition is that they have not been vaccinated yet.
If vaccination has begun in the last year or earlier, the following vaccinations must be paid on their own.
The first vaccine dose should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year a quarter of families have voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumonia.
While parents paid 1600 crowns, they wanted more for a dose.
Vaccination of younger people requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that each year health insurance costs 300 to 450 000 rabbits at vaccine doses.
However, they are based on medical care that non-vaccinated children would need.
To date, the State has spent some 500,000 crowns per year for the entire vaccination of children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of central urea inflammation, but also serious infections such as manoeuvre inflammation and blood clotting.
According to hospital surveys, there were only 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation for the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovskiy Association indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long been promoting vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we had optional vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to have at least this.
I think it's a guide to follow now that Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to modify the vaccination process against pneumonia.
We do not think of it at all for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Vaccination optional to his or her incompetence, says doctors.
Hannah Cabrnochová, President of the Specialized Paediatric Society, recognizes that a vaccination based on volunteerism is a failure.
However, if all children were vaccinated, a decrease in the renewal of vaccinations could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination optional", said Cabrnochová.
Experts estimate that in the next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will be vaccinated by their food.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also a violation of the fact that it is the first vaccination of children financed by insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should free funds for prevention, thus saving future medical care.
Doctors should buy their own products
However, this is related to the concerns of practitioners, who are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the State.
Some Members feared, however, that this would allow insurance to "depend on sickness insurance".
In this way, doctors will have to buy products and expect insurance to pay them.
According to estimates, paediatrics will have to invest nearly 40,000 rabbits per month in vaccines, which is an important sum.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de musée"
The son of Frank Frazetta, a well-known illustration, was accused of trying to fly tables for a value of $20 million (12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interpolated while he was loading 90 tablets in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to it, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical leather to force the entrance of the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his design of personnel such as Conan le Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reporting the Associated Press (AP).
The AP cited a police officer who said that young Mr Frazetta might have been motivated by a family circle.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Frazetta Jr, claimed that his father had been authorized to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the tables into a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta Senior said that he had no such authorization.
The Labour Office defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in the tax and expenditure reductions announced in the pre-budget report, despite the criticisms of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "was missing" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by reporting his decisions to the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the dust by attacking the low and average wages.
Among its main proposals, there is an increase of 0.5 per cent of social security and a 1 per cent ceiling on public salaries since 2011.
The Anger of Social Security
The unions protested that the low wages were penalized by a recession that they were not responsible for and kept in mind that "problems" were announced.
The reduction in social security - which will allow about 3 billion GDP per year - has put the world in a state of anger, because it says it is a tax on employment while the goal should be a slowdown in the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
FINAL PROVISIONS OF THE REPORT OF THE PRE-Budget
Social security will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will be reduced to 4.75% expected this year.
New 50% rate on bankers' bonus
The increase in the tax on the benefits of the company for small companies has been abandoned
Rebates of electric and oil cars
Retraction increase by 2.5%
According to Tresor's estimates, a person who wins $30,000 will lose $90 per year and a person who will earn $40,000 worth $90 per year, while a person who wins $10,000 per year will gain 110 more.
The ministers said that their objective of reducing the deficit by 2013 was "hard decisions", but stressed that 60 per cent of the additional charges would be imposed on the first 5 per cent of employees.
Stephen Timms, Secretary of the Treasury, rejected a tax increase and stressed that a decrease in expenditure was a "water shortage in the ocean" relative to what was necessary.
"These figures are important. They will enable us to divide by two deficits, which will be absolutely necessary in the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that the growth of the economy would increase by the end of the year.
However, the Labour forecast on economic growth - which will influence the amount to be used and the speed at which the deficit will be met - was questioned after the Chancellor was forced to review its first figures.
In his statement, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline in 3.5% in April - while the empire would be 3 billion GDP above the previous estimate.
"No Opportunity"
The Conservatives who will launch this Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of the Labour, stated that the project to borrow 789 billion GBP over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to pay, they added, choosing "synically" difficult choices until after the elections - which should be held in June 2010.
"They did not make any significant statements about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, the Chief Secretary of the Fantem Cabinet Treasure. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after election, whatever the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour stresses that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further reductions, contrary to the proposals of the Tory which would lead to a faster and more important reduction in deficits.
However, the Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through the increase in taxes and the reduction of expenditure would be used to support the expenditure of the next year and not to reduce the deficit, supporting the plans being "constructed on wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC Political Editor, stated that the announcements calendar - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April next, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, the Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people are most in need and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Faux budget"
Although the ministers had not published the details of expenditure beyond 2011, the economists stated that it was clear that the restrictions on public expenditure would only be made to feel at a medium-term level.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies stated that the figures of Chancellor involve, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is not actually reported," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accounts.
"This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are well accountable."
The FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested on a raid at a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US Embassy in Pakistan announced to the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the US state of Virginia last month.
The Department of Foreign Affairs of the United States said he was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as being Pakistani descent, one of Egypt's heritage and the other of Yemen's origin.
If these are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what charges they have found and what conditions they have been held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesman, said that the agency had knowledge of arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they are really the students who are missing," she said.
Pakistan's embassy in Washington claimed that men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them.
It said that the house had already been monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, rejected any comments on the arrests, reported the press agency Reuters, but said that the United States needed to "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan in order to try to develop the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been expelled from their home by their families in Virginia, north of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as low as ever, according to Amnesty International's report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
A man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes and another said he had been threatened with violence.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms regarding its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the greatest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
A dozen were sentenced to prison sentences and the prosecutors claimed that at least five persons were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, corresponding to BBC in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of protests, the superior leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our competitor said.
"Fause confession"
Amnesty International referred to a 26-year-old computer student, Ibrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of "Traviling with Facebook's networks" and protesting the results of the election.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humbled me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and in half conscience, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate for the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that after the election demonstrators were tortured to death and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities filed charges of violence, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of an old prisoner who said he had been buried in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary would create a committee to investigate the difficult post-elections and the Government's response, but it stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested during the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski tracks built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform Bristol's site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for species prices.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small tramplin preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, studying in the fourth year of medicine, said that the look at the top of the track was great but that it was rather scary.
It's a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city cintilant in contrast.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talent," he added.
Prices have won the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday evening, the snow will be abandoned in the spring.
Every day they and us
Can Islam be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a Lao State.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the folk" (2006), an excellent and well documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
The last book by Mr Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious frame.
He does not just want to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent months in museums, schools and institutes that are now providing in France what M. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well to listen and repeat the discussions between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the Mary (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical issues, he says, which are the other day, rather than political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the great public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern Latin society.
They don't stop the debate until the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers of a Sunni Puritan Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today is a small part of European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the laity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with each field's efforts.
It asks what the French politicians (and the Guardian intellectual elite so virulant of laity) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been punished, in relation to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also made historical compromises with Latin republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "secretity of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tried to say "yes, but not yet."
The View of the World’s Darkest
The Arctic changes faster and more dramaticly than any other place on the planet.
The ice that the composition is based on a alarming speed, bringing a life that cannot survive any more.
Petroleum, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their seal.
In "On a soft glass cup", Richard Ellis, writer and illustration, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
He describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved them by throwing their white sand.
The meeting of Amiral Nelson, then courageous for 14 years, who had to fight only the point of his musquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
Young bears, captured while they were on their mother's side, just killed, were captured and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show was gathering 75 hours at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually a millionth of the surface required for an adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar clock living in Singapore has become green due to the algae that were put in its space.

Mr. They told the stories of other writers and historians and often referred to the threat posed by hunters on the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Motoski Indians use powerful hunting rifles to hunt their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters that are in the north of these two countries of the chaos that the ice will remain longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, an old editor in the head of New Scientist, offers a clear and exciting summary of Arctic science and a captivating view of what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherics nor oceanographers can directly relate to the speed of change.
It's not necessary to try.
At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th, the pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen provided the first information on the source of the glacier.
The Cold War sub-margins then mapping the changes in sub-cellular relief.
Satellite surveillance and the sound on the icebergs are a great help, but the biggest part of the work is done by men who are tired, campaigning in the cold.
Mr. Anderson is the extraordinary and small world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by the hydro-pressed steam pumps.
But from the sound mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.

From the Marines, among the 6,000 people who have deposited graves in Arlington
The first class of De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, made a seven-hour bus trip to place a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, in the Arlington National Cemetery Center, this day was devoted to welcoming men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, where we'll be sent, we'll risk being in their place, said Robinson about dead soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, that's why I just try to show respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered on Saturday morning to deposit corrons on veterans' graves in different sections of Arlington Ceremony's cemetery.
In 1992, Morris Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the memorial and others decided to rent several hundred graveyards in Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a 18-year-old tradition, Morris and his wife, Karen, travel every year, stop in different cities on their way, organize memorials in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the summit graveyards of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, on the Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorial site for the victims of the 93 United Airlines flight to Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation provided more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charlene Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a retired career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who were sacrificed.
It's a little management that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmetouufled in a number of hot garments, volunteers traded between the poles and the columns extended from the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen old graves, since World War I and World War II, as well as Vietnam's war, because they are not as often visited as new graves have declared the organizers.
The humor was optimum, while the children were playing and the shoes were held by hand, carrying the pin crowns on the gray beds.
Each round crown had a green background color, with a little red paperboard on the top.
Closely, the silence was planned for Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhumane.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to draw the section, but the shadow of the current wars covered the area.
Individuals wept without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends stood in cold air.
Some read aloud the names recorded in the stone while others thought of seeing the small black and white information cards, focused on the cold ground for those who had not yet finished the tomb.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears, on her son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield, Ohio, and she had been driving eight hours to come to gather at the grave of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, dead in July.
No one should ever forget about what we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
" long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
A U.S. resident arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government has arrested an American resource that distributed mobile phones and portable computers in the country, confirming the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States.
The source, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana tried to have access to the detention that was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made publicly, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for “dangerous”.
All activities are revolutionary, including moderate protests and critical writings, leading to the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of more and more bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husband and are followed and angered by government officials.
Sanchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but his authorizations have always been rejected.
The arrest of an American resident may increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which continues a "duce" approach to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government move forward at concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and portable computers are allowed in Cuba, whether these are new consumer goods and desired in a country or the average wage of a staff member is $15 per month.
Only this year has the Cuban Government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press associate with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be authorized -- freely distributing mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Human Rights Watch Group program, recently published a serious report on freedom in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often triggers a negative reaction to the United States, when both countries start to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a deal from sending men to Afghanistan
Sadie, the Pakistani authorities said that an organization proposed to prepare a deal to send five people from Virginia to northern Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would provide an important network of terrorists recruiting the Internet for the search of young radicalized men.
The investigators claimed that they had a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Upon arrival in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them join the region of Pakistan's tribal headquarters, al-Qaida camp and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services reported on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA's mission to filter the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargotha, far from the forbidden mountains in the north-east became a refugee of terrorism.
They were regarded as infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed his intention to maintain anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men had been determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to enter the camps in al-Qaida when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are questioned by the FBI -- focuses on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people in whom they trust.
Since the September 11, 2001, U.S. secret services have given priority to filtering men in the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing to enter those who do not show a serious commitment and who may be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits have been studied almost by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American goals and their value of preaching.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups should also be more careful in recent years in the choice of persons they accept because American secret services became experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many others have already followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is the one that is more and more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen demand a "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of protesters have gone to the streets, here on Saturday, asking for a more important action on the climate of the negotiating party working in the Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of exhibitors was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 were estimated by the police.
This event took place relatively slowly, although a small number of masked activists discovered some explosives near a set of government buildings, in the city centre.
On a day when little was done during the discussions on the United Nations climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists were marketed from the city, distributing maps in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says it's enough."
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to his mother's native country, Peru, opened his eyes on the emerging problems that the country must face because of the impact of the climate change that has already taken place."
That's one of the reasons why I decided to join the big market -- to pass the word and launch an appeal to the world's leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the center of Bella and said that she had arrested 19 people because they were carrying a mask or they were holding pockets.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the center of Bella and said that she had arrested 19 people because they were carrying a mask or they were holding pockets.
According to a passenger who asked for anonymity to be kept due to its involvement in climate discussions, activists carrying masks and black clothes have raised several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by some departments.
They threw them near the furniture, he said, adding that they were all in front of the fussies, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Congress Palace, people were gathered around TV screens to follow the course, all along the afternoon.
But it seems that demonstrators have failed to raise the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, representing China for climate.
When he was asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he answered in English "In fact, it was something I didn't know.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "The event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that the course might look negative or useful according to the perspective.
It shows the interest of the great public and the different sectors in the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or that they undermine the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal a sharp distinction between race
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics brought good news to the public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the District remains far behind the headquarters, the report shows that Grades 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what comes from the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Education Progress) is the continuing gap between the results of Africans and whites on both local and national plans.
The average results of white children from grade 4 (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased from 3 points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009, ranging from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Africans in grade 8 (4th) is generally constant, ranging from 245 to 244.
The mean white results were not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view of a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results of the two groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58 points.
The last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase in the instruction group director Michelle A. Rhee and the Mary, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were promoted by white students who were already well-known.
This would mean that we raised the assembly by considering the elements above the scale, which is problematic and ginful, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not welcome one or two winning points, said Kwame R. Brown (democratic appearance), a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, in Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the test results message is that the city's middle schools (colleges) are desperately in need of attention.
Indeed, you always want to see positive signs and I respect them.
But what makes us afraid is that we do not spend enough time and energy in our secondary schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty.
For example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of classes at the end of the elementary school and starting college who have not integrated the basics of reading earlier in their school courses and who are slow enough in relation to their friends.
Every day, the math program for the Kindergarten (mother) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real life games and experiences, as they have been put in the District by the former responsible Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students at a level lower than that of the class, says Rhee.
Another view is that the results of the NEPAD raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest areas of Washington.
It may also have political implications for this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that, like the other superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We concentrate on the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, whatever their origin, will be able to obtain excellent public education for their children.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to reducing the gap of success was that of the traditional public school, today 180 days in Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher's union last year to get 185 days, that he considered a "start point" to get an additional increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long simple stop.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, comes down and looks a moment in the eyes of white columns, bristles and verdant polos.
Graciela's parents could only finish school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never put her feet on a university campus.
Also, while she and other students from grade 8 (4th) of the group studied Gettysburg where school costs were $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of a new impressed student than a enthusiasmist.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela was excommunicated who would like to study the medicine, while the guide led them to the entrance of the scientific furniture.
Youpi, really? she said loud, when she was given the low ratio professor of law -- student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery trip and now they have fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widely posed for the large number of American children born to Spanish immigrant parents who have left school where they have become parents at an early age, they are also hundreds of thousands of students to receive university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Spanish of the "second generation" on five-fold study in the school -- a remarkable success if it is considered that both their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without finishing the school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they are opening the way for the following generations who will play an important role in the country's work.
Researchers who study combatants claim that they have a natural disability with the school and a need for success.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Menorat programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who have no experience and skills to help them navigate the system, no intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from mother to child.
The federal program that financed the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared for you), it provides over $300 million per year to local school systems to organize the preparation programs at the university that begin when students of low-income families are in high school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Petroleum Ministry receives agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has succeeded in attracting important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two Saturdays.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggested that oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are in the process of playing a major role in the restoration of the oil industry in Iraq, which has been invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are repatriated with a participation in only two of the 10 fields assigned to the encherries.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second round that started Friday.
The only one who put a knife was lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for the fields set up in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American societies, they were Asian and European companies that opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraqi Oil Forum, a website on the Internet.
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The security concerns, corroded by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability, as American military troops withdrew from the American oil companies, preventing them from entering more strongly in Iraq, which has the world's third largest gross oil reserve, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and were more likely to take risks because they did not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have enjoyed strong ties with the Ministry of Petroleum and have provided him with their technical advice, are restored.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two contracts assigned this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has more research on contracts than other companies and is divided with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will meet its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-elected companies have made offers that were then compared to the price per barrel that the Department agreed to sell to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American mission, which had hit the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared to be Friday by the American anti-Speech authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorists' leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a couple of missiles launched in their cars, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to the American sources and the Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They drove a white car, headed to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, declared a member of Pakistani civilian secret services, speaking on the telephone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority stated that suspected local militants were premeditated on site and quickly confirmed what remained of the "completely decomposed bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American anti-terrorist representatives gave no specific evidence that Somalia was part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of Al Qaida ' s military organizers leading terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize summits around the world, one of the authorities who wanted to keep anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside the Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the US authority stated that Somalia had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known by the great American public, but this does not reduce the threat he poses for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If her death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second important person of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a group of soldiers in the tribal centre, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups who have advanced to reduce their vulnerability while also impotiably killing suspects, says the site.
UN Special Envoy to Kaboul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would resign from his position in March, at the end of a mortuous mandate for allegations of corruption extended during the United Nations presidential elections.
The Eide Department intervenes when Obama's administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations Ambassador said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States calendar for a withdrawal of troops that would start in 18 months and that would require other NATO Governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to Afghanistan and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide stated in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international officials by helping political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not give up, but that he would simply respect the commitment he had made to his family in March not to spend more than two years in Kaboul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives state that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been mentioned; it is a citizen of Italy-Switzerland who has recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who has previously conducted United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been tested after his former associate, Peter W. Galbraith, accused of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and disseminating evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide did not object to these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's allegations -- which were appreciated -- "have been detrimental to the mission because there has already been a good dose of scepticism on the international observation of elections".
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the support of the American forces in Afghanistan.
It also urged UN officials to allow their successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he was assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed his frustration about the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations procurement regulations had given him the opportunity to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person ever since, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran has to face additional sanctions
The Secretary to the Defence, Robert. Gates, said on Friday that the great powers of the world would soon impose on Iran "relevant additional sanctions" because of his inability to engage in nuclear ambition talks.
Gates, speaking in front of a party of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, detached the possibility of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a defeat.
One of my greatest concerns is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side of the war.
Obama's administration considered a set of sanctions that would refer to Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He stated that a "a set of motivations and punishments" could be necessary to convince the Iranian Government that it would be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "the people would suffer enormously" of these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement of the White House's speech, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran would face "problem" consequences if it did not complete its nuclear programme in accordance with the United Nations Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In his speech in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his urea stockpiling in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has promoted such an agreement to develop confidence on both sides and to make time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have been far away from the attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage or not with the United States.
I believe that Iran's rejection of some of the international community's proposals for which they had agreed at the beginning of October prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to agree on what they had not considered, in the light of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as a limited date for Iran to respond to proposals, before turning to other options, including the continuation of what State Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "improved sanctions".
In a statement made yesterday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations announced what it called "unfounded allegations" of certain members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it was agreed to continue talking with the United States and five other major world powers, "to achieve a long-term satisfactory solution".
Gates, who had to go back to Washington late Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before taking the plane for Kurdish's rich oil region to meet the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are persistent tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delay in American plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115 000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to ease the concerns of the Kurds about the suspension. The American authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We won't leave you."
In ageing China, a change in direction
Wang Wejiia and her husband had grown up around advertising them, saying, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "A more baby, it's a more grave."
They have learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient rate of birth of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed this condition and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their response has been instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
He told us no second, he said 31 years old, Director of Human Resources and who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of the only child in China, creating two generations of single children with good toys and cats, especially the "little emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents of 60 years and more will be exploited, will be 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in coastal rich cities with a very educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and more represented nearly 22 per cent of the population of the residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Committee of the Municipal Population of Shanghai and Family Planning) stated that fertility couples should have babies in order to "help to reduce the proportion of the elderly and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is on the point of becoming "as old as - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
A progressive detonation
As stated in the 1978 Constitution, the Chinese policy of the only child is now the most controversial obligation introduced by the Government of the Community.
Couples who violate this policy are likely to have to pay for Colossians's fines - up to three times a year - and to face discrimination at work.
The Chinese authorities gave the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced women from a second child to abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys - girls normally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population gradually adopted their position on the policy of the only child.
In 2004, they gave more exceptions to the rule -- including for the inhabitants of cities, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they adopted many of their strong slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, Pekin University, said that the authorities of the central government have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families not to have only one child were replaced by detailed copies of regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city's government has provided family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their home and to move forward under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the response was disappointing.
Responsibilities
Although officials in a rural town of Shanghai Bay said they saw an increase in requests for couples seeking a second child after the start of the campaign, the most urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, has always received only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials stated that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010, is still expected to be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, responsible for family planning committee in the commune of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to have their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said they would love to have two children and that they were legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they said that the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners considered it wrong that the policy of the only child is a problem of rights, stated Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months of the first child of the couple.
True, we want the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples mention psychological reasons to explain their harassment.
Wang, responsible for human resources, said that she wanted only one child because she was the same. "We were the center of the family and we were the habit of everyone's taking care of us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it most deeply.
For couples working at two, of the middle class, who are going to lower the birth rate, he says, you must be self-sufficient to succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s have grown up seeing their parents fight in China's first days and do not want to have this style of life themselves, he says.
Even one child demands a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must leave at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "If your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best mother."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too much sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The United Nations climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized offices and mutual crimes -- has come under the fires of the Friday disaster, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations spreading most of the burden over the next few years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final policy agreement to regulate greenhouse gas has highlighted the remaining obstacles, as it has clarified the way to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the ongoing negotiations, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
A United Nations special working group, the text does not say how rich countries would provide the poor to support climate recovery, in the short and long term.
It offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the increase in world temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
He gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited six pages of the document, examined a text of 180 pages to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on the United Nations climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would generally reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions from 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also launched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same verbal changes have been made, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the representative of the United States for climate negotiations rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gas by industrialized countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama's administration becomes more difficult to China than Bush's administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei had said that the major American negotiator, whether "good" or "very irresponsible" to say earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to combat climate warming.
With the future economic strategories of the major world power in play, deficits are reflected both within the Third World and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle concerns the survival of individual economies rather than the saving of the planet, with China and the United States, of their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen of the most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main forces were fighting to know who should rise the cost of greenhouse gas reduction, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony has been developed, Ulate said, which is also a consultant on climate for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries were more vulnerable to the impact of climate change, said they would continue to pressure a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants said that negotiations would lead to a political agreement at least.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which met 43 members, prepared a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Mitzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of the small island states "has placed a political pressure on the full political process", partly because they are now united and ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the problems in the process before the Heads of Government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as Minister for the Environment of India, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of Environment have come from their plane and are scheduled to attend the Bella Center meeting in huis-clos and information conferences in order to be able to make claims that will be examined during the following week.
The real picture of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave from the Palais Congress every day -- guitar players present night shows moving from the countries they call themselves and that proposals are prepared and distributed on paper rather than by e-mails -- are a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the court of the great, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for the World Conservation International policy.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefined the Monday syndrome
At 5 a.m. Monday morning, a couple of tickets will spend the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Great Britain.
The country's first high-speed bathing train will reach 225 km/h, while it will take Ashford, in Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin train outside London.
It is hoped that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will relaunch the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The lost small trolleys will become flowering towns, the duration of business travel will be much longer, and the passage of the plane and the train will reduce the national carbon emissions while reducing the freight on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties joined the project.
But the tens of billions of books needed to build a new iron network, the inevitable planning battle and the environmental threats are likely to freeze the lines at great speed.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to carry out a feasibility report for the Government will submit its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new London link line to the West Midlands will be drawn up in the five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact can be disputed.
In the campaign, the plan will be designed up to 25 metres from the final quarter.
It is also foreseen that HS2 provides three options for a larger network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer the press.
The preferred options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line of anger up to West Midlands.
The line will be separated either in or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west of the Penguins in Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east, to Shefield, Leeds and Newcastle Opon Tyne.
A single line will cross the Ecosex.
"It seems to be the best performance option," said a railway professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced by 2 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a journey of an hour at the moment.
The proposals will allow you to travel 400km/h, making the world's fastest British network.
The initial track is designed to allow 400m long trains and can transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London-Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is foreseen that an existing train will be expanding to receive the network at high speed.
Railway industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offers this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken prior to a general election.
Even if the machine starts, the network will have to be built part of it.
Trains will first be required to run out of high-speed lines on the railways in north Birmingham, preserving the travel periods between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure the passage of trains, which is a reference point for the revolution of the rail.
The taxpayers pay the 75,000 GBP loan for Tory's Orangoriery
Alan Duncan, chief member of the Tory Parliament, paid to the taxpayer of thousands of books per year to pay back the cost of an orange that he built in his house of his subscription.
The party's responsibility, which was withdrawn by David Cameron to complain that the members of the parliament were "intertained", increased its 75,000 GBP premium to build an extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of books per month, to the contributor.
The Commons authorities have received the complaints at that time and have not been questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out control of the expenditure of the members. On the last night, Mr. Duncan said that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, is the owner of a two-star house in a village in his district of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly a million books.
The rent includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the office claims that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
Neighbors describe it as a "viranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in employment during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Communities with regard to its pre-primary rules.
The Committee noted that any non-compliance with the rules had been incurred in the last month following an investigation of its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the 271,406 GBP empire of his property in London to the house of his subscription that he bought in 1991, the year before he became a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately 1,400 GBP per month of interest until March of the last year.
In April, its requests increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the $75,000 loan.
The standard interest rate for RBS variable is 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, with no movement since then.
The latest publication of the Common Authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Head of the Fantasy Cabinet in September, after a cover-up journalist filmed him saying that Parliament's members had to survive "sur-budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "under budget" and you're treated as "from m..."
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't do it."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former position as a oil negotiator, began to have to explain his expenses in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the Bureau of Costs that "may be considered excessive".
An activist believed a £ hole in the pool of M. Duncan, to protest after it was discovered that he had requested $4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the empire, last night Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, both approved by the Office of Costs and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with the development or use of rules or whatever.
It was all clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be more clean or more simple."
Ladies and gentlemen, come and see the Brighton Avenue Calendar.
The Brighton beach cabins have found a new means of promoting the winter months, an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to rent their cabin for each day of December, using Christmas songs as the theme.
The event started on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin from 1730 to 1830 a.m. every day, with dishes and hot wine served free of charge.
Noel's songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-remunerated priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As the Church, why do we expect people to come into an old strange place? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Avent Calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and living place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have expressed themselves to claim an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming through the world and Copenhagen, where the police have conducted hundreds of complaints.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of people, according to the organizers, have fallen into the cold in the Danish capital, within the framework of the United Nations Climate Conference on Friday, with an agreement that can enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate across the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped make a very high "political price" in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the strike, when a group of 300 demonstrators, completely dressed in black, broke down the windows with cuts and hammers, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emeducated police are quick to intervene without housekeeping.
In total, the police announced the interpolation of 600 to 700 people, essentially according to the members of the Blacks Blocks, these ultra-violent groups that were particularly illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, condemned the conditions in which hundreds of combatants were interviewed "without distinction", stressing that one hundred of them "were always held in the street on Saturday evening "meaned and held in position in spite of extreme cold".
The Parliament's party, rather a good child, took the lead in the Bella Center, a negotiation site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without looking to paint it.
A scene was designed to welcome scheduled speakers, before a glance at the channels with the participation of the former South African archival of the Cap, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters had come in and out of large cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for most of them in impermissible blue sky, had formed a first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the Call of Earth's Friends, who wanted to form "Blue Seas" for "Climate Justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for restoration of the ecological debt in favor of the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino military soldier from the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: we've been in time, we've loved the songist Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers in Africa, water courses where we can walk as we had never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the globalist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French Eurodepute José Bové, a figure of globalism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen to "free climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate recovery and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which opened many islands particularly vulnerable to rechasing, had given up the sending of demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, were down in the streets in Australia.
In Manille, a few hundred people, students for most, stood in red, treeing bananas with solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred gatherings of demonstrators have also been held to claim an energy action against climate change.
In France, the exhibitions organized by the "350" network have collected hundreds of people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few tens of people gathered in Geneva.
Abkhazia separatist elected his president, Georgia declares a "fashioned"
Abkhazia has elected her president, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi declares a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first round after the Russian-Georgia War of August 2008 for the control of the South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The voting offices closed at 1700 GMT.
The participation rate was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure, according to the electoral commission's officials Abkhaze.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing President, Sergei Bagapch, have categorically rejected the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the detention of the jury.
These elections are a stage.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michel Saakachvili, "requires that Abkhazia should fall under the full occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, Nicaragua and Venezuela alone recognized the independence of this 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it an illegal part of Georgia occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which has caused thousands of deaths, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new age as independent state, declared to the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the poll office in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with some palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the Presidential Council in this region in the sub-region, on the Black Sea.
A large panel showing Mr. Bagapch on the side of the Russian Prime Minister and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putine are located in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials who come to monitor the exit of the castle.
We, the people of Abkhaze, have said during a small ceremony, in spite of Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, answered in front of a vodka glass.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two business men, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized last year's agreements with Moscow, as the former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and the two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, have been monitoring the way out for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither current power nor opposition.
A 50% majority more than one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second tour must be organised in two weeks.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people around the world have been marketed on Saturday to claim an ambitious and binding agreement to the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the one hand, interviewed almost 700 people in the event of a devastating event.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of people, according to the organizers, were found in the cold on the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosted the 193 delegates by 18 December to an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament's party, the cortage, the overall good child, took the lead in the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center, without looking to paint.
A scene was designed to welcome scheduled speakers, before a glance at the channels with the participation of the former South African archival of the Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the strike, a group of hundreds of demonstrators, completely dressed in black, bristles and marts, broke down the windows, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emergent police have been slowed down and intervened without housekeeping, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interpolation of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, these ultra-violent groups that were particularly illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the balconies by a paddle and four cars burned near a squad during incidents that led to the interpolation of a hundred people, according to the police.
We have the extremist groups, which have prevented the police's speech, Henrik Jacobsen, while the helicopters of the order's forces have returned to heaven.
The majority of protesters, incarceration and training in the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for most of them in impermissible blue sky, had formed a first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the Call of Earth's Friends, who wanted to form "Blue Seas" for "Climate Justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to ask for restoration of the ecological debt in favor of the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino military soldier from the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.

For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the globalist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French Eurodepute José Bové, a figure of globalism, said to the AFP to be brought to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate recovery and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, including Danishman Helena Christensen, former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who should be addressed to the people.
The Asia-Pacific region, which opened many islands particularly vulnerable to rechasing, had given up the sending of demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, were down in the streets in Australia.
In Manille, a few hundred people, students for most, showed up, clothes of red and bushing of bananas, enjoying solar energy in front of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, a number of hundreds of demonstrators have also been gathered to claim action against climate change.
In France, the exhibitions organized by the "350" network have collected hundreds of people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few tens of people gathered in Geneva.
The Geological History of the General Lycese Reform, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "strengthened" by the reform of the general school, despite the removal of their compulsory teaching in scientific terminals.
The first students will now have every four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, "he has to get out of hypocrisy" because, he says, "the profile S is no longer a scientific career" but "in large, it concentrates on the best students."
The EU and L filters cannot continue to be sub-filters of the S, and they continue to stress: "I have not heard much of history and intellectuals no longer escape from the absence of the final history of geography in technological accidents."
Sadie, a study published in the Humanities revealed that nearly seven French out of ten (69%) failed the government project to remove the compulsory teaching of the history of geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this removal, as well as the left and some right-wing.
The Minister further added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of the S Terminal Program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (educators and unions) called for a Tuesday mobility day to protest against the project, which sacrificed the teaching of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will undergo an admission test at the beginning of the year which will bring their discipline, and at the end of the year an admission test that will affect their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will follow stages during the M2 year and will be the first year in front of the students as seasonal teachers.
If you add all the stages proposed before the competition, you will already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, it will continue.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to education, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "from here to 2012".
In Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss issues at Copenhagen Summit: this was the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Upper Normal School of the Ulm Street Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, introduced the first "Ernest" conference, a day consisting of a training of experts, every 15 minutes, filmed and open to the public, found a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and made them want to know more, explained at the Edouard Hannezo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day who takes his name from the one given by the students to the school bass.
Twenty stakeholders are selected among the experts of their discipline and are selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding climate recovery, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with the help of graphics, in front of a 50 people.
This is part of our scientific role, he pointed out, hoping that the auditors would say that "the Copenhagen conference would support a very serious scientific document".
The video released at these conferences will be posted online on the school's website from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bi-mesteral pace.
Payment delay: anger of prison supervisors, planned actions
Prison supervisor unions called on Friday for "general mobilization" to require the release of the end-of-year premiums and additional hours paid in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2the surveillance union) requested staff who would not be in service to appear tomorrow morning before the penal institutions and to "block them", to "declare the flight of their duties".
The Penitentiary CGT (3rd trade union) calls on them to " meet in the general assemblies in different prisons for a strong mobilization", judging the non-payment in December of "additional hours, nights, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first surveillance union, the Ufap/Unsa, "calls for general mobilization (...) to eliminate discontent and anger".
The Prison Administration Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that additional hours have increased significantly in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensures that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery stated at the end of the day that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent an e-mail to the observers' unions to ensure that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this e-mail.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place a set of measures to ensure that this situation does not result in a negative assessment of the number of additional hours in the future, said Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be fair, except for senior management staff who receive famous awards for functions and objectives, disappointed the Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have two good".
It is a scandal, the interregional FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until the new order "all meetings and calls".
The staff will not work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regulated in December, idem for additional hours, also threatening FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
When we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our effectiveness, it is more sad that we should take them to the staff's dens, I consider Bordeaux's CGT Penitentiary.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less bad than others.
However, in all respects the account is not available, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
By Noël, Obama said to offer "more expensive trokes" than those he gets
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas at the White House, entrusted the "paper" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule on gifts: "I give more expensive tricks than those I receive."
In the context of a special issue that will be broadcast on the ABC channel last night, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious stay.
Even Bo, the little mate at four feet of the family will be on the side.
Father Noël also loved Bo, thus said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "surely" a gift, according to the emissions released in advance.
And Michelle Obama was wrong about her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "I certainly didn't offer you nice gifts last year," she told the president.
Certainly, it has been forced to grant before repetitiously repeat by showing duly the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who has offered it to you?".
During this one hour's emission, in the detracted atmosphere, with the famous animator, who was a supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife were also reminded of their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama called out a train at ten speeds, but also a basketball ball that his father used to say he rarely saw him offering Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father came to see us for Noël and where he gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
It's not much later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this balloon.
The First Lady remembered her side of her grandpa's house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I tied up all the furniture against the wall instead of setting them around the road, but I loved this little house of poppies, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reopened, RTL says it's artificial
Johnny Hallyday was reopened in Los Angeles due to important "Lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "controlled" according to its surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed as an artificial to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reopened on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had found "departments resulting from the operation" in Paris on November 26, he indicated to Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "needed a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, was to be assured that the situation was "controlled", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be made available at 48 hours later.
According to the RTL, a partner of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday, however, would have been thrown into an artificial coma to avoid "tribulation and complications".
This is not just that at 48 hours we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when it opens an eye, add RTL.
Queryed by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no dragon would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of the Parc Monceau for this dismal hernie.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, has been practiced by the neurosurgery Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This was not available on Thursday evening to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles for a follow-up infection.
The singer Eddie Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, loved to play on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but made sure he didn't "no worry" about rocker, which is "a fighter".
He just called me before leaving for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a connery because it was twelve hours after such an operation, that's not funny, Eddy Mitchell said.
Wednesday night, the producer of the singer Jean-Claude Camus was curious, saying that Johnny Hallyday "was able to respond in a satisfactory way to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endued".
Mr Camus had also said he had been interested in Laeticia, the husband of the singer, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, in general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had discovered that he had been operated by a "small cancer of the colon", after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer repeated his long "Tour 66", presented as his afternoon tour.
But since then, every health problem has been quite a comment. Fans and journalists have noted the difficulties of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, it even had to decompose a new hospital.
Euro-2009/little bassin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
Frances Frédérick Bousquet, a multi-mediad world-2009 bassin, described Thursday an international title on a distance that he particularly enjoys, the 50 m free nag, in the 2009 Euro-2009 small bass in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time has seen only three world battus records, while there was a delay.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 nags and the other two Russians on 4x50 m 4 nags.
A regret for Bousquet, who was proud of the 50 m-free world record, which holds the brand in large bassine (20.94).
On one of the two queens of the birth, 50 m free is the 28-year-old French that was imposed in 20 a.m. 53 in a final where ten nagers usually took the eight, first at international level.
Bousquet advanced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the global brand (20.30) as he had imagined.
We can always sleep better and in the event, I said that if the world's record was at my disposal, I'd go to try it.
Like Bousquet, the almost total number of Nagers were dressed in polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their episode in Istanbul, which had welcomed the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations has not been used this time in Germany Paul Biedermann, a double champion of the world in large bassin this summer in Rome, world records in key.
The young master failed to lower the mark on 400 m free sail (3:32.77) but was still imposed by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danois Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I'm not focused on this course.
I knew I couldn't fight a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and carry out my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
U.S.: a tarcophage panel belonging to Zola attached $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophage panel belonging particularly to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, just above his estimate, announced the trade of art Sotheby's.
This panel before two feet long over 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "presenting four dionysic scenes in a sophisticated architecture decoration surrounded by satyrs and bats, is a rare part, there are only four or five in the world", explained to AFP Mardi Florent Heintz, vice-president of the arts of Roman and Egyptian ancient art at Sotheby's.
He was sold in one hundred pieces.
The sale is still ongoing, but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers are most concerned so far, has indicated to the AFP a password from Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola goes back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgesese family, then appeared at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his Parisian special hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council prior to the entry into the power of the Patain Marréchal.
There's been a dark zone for a hundred years.
Under the cover of the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola follow-up" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Therèse Raquin" and the freshness of the "Rougon-Macquaart".
Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who saw the rejection of a safe conduct by the Portuguese government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, it seems to indicate that the possibilities for the transfer are not met, said the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
When Wednesday arrived in El Salvador to hire Mr. Zelaya, the Government of Mexico was assigned to its original location, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Portuguese government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "demission" and to ask for political asylum abroad to give him a safe conduct.
But the president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as head of the state in exercise of the invitation.
The Portuguese government "knowed a new mistake by wanting me to give up my burden (...), they wanted me to release," said Jedio Zelaya to the Global Radio, which he has often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis that lasts for five months in Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added a few agreements by the president, who has been fled to Brazil from Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's ambassador presented us with a request for safety, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum applications, the Minister of the Interior of the Punchist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, told the Honduran Radio HRN.
I do not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had responded to an interview at the Telesur chain, where the seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras should take place as the President of the people of Honduras, he pointed out.
Mr. Zelaya's departure rummers had mobilized the delegates of the dehu president, who had come to gather around Brazil's embassy, where the soldiers had strengthened their seats.
The Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the Portuguese government.
This demonstrates the marginal character of this Government in view of international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who was approached by Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, was reconvened on June 28, the day he organized a popular consultation to prepare his election against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he returned with surprise on 21 September and fled to Brazil's embassy.
If he succeeds, he will be arrested to answer the crime of "high trafficking" in which he accuses justice, according to the Portuguese government.
The Portuguese President, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the contested poll recognized by the United States but was challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted in a loud voice against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street mountain, U.S. commercial balance food optimisation
The New York Forum ended on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance testify to the withdrawal of both U.S. and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, technologically dominant, 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The larger standard index & Poor's 500 was added 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There are good news coming from different economies, Judge Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotic, she waited, believing that the market would focus on "the full half-life wine".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which shows that the activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September at $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expected to reverse an increase in deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth of volumes of trade, particularly for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major US trade partners, said Christopher Cornell, of the Economic.com research firm.
On the other hand, new registrations in unemployment in the United States have increased against any expectations of the last week, in order to reach 474,000 requests.
But in the last four weeks, the average of the number of new employment applicants "has fallen to the lowest of one year," stressed Scott Marcowiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The compulsory market has fallen.
The 10-year-old Tresor's good performance increased to 3,482% against 3,423% Tuesday night, and that from 30-year-olds to 4,492% against 4,408% of the guard.
Cuba: hundreds of members of power consist of "white ladies"
Several hundred Cuban officials were married to husbands of political prisoners gathered in La Havane for the World Day of Human Rights and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were interviewed.
A quarter of "white ladies", married or close to political prisoners, were formed in full street by the government's supporters of Raul Castro, while they went to the capital centre to claim the release of political prisoners, found a journalist from the AFP.
Down the Yankees!, "Merzens!", "The street belongs to revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" were scandalized, the rising bridge, the parties of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil servants who came to "insure their protection".
The guard, a similar demonstration was performed against the "white ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
However, in the Lebanese province of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also seeking to demonstrate Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were, interpolated by civil police, a journalist from the AFP.
Police have forced the dissidents who were made up of government parties in civilian vehicles, according to the journalist.
Dissident interactions in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Receipts of the Sakharov Prize 2005 of the European Parliament, the "white ladies" had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200, according to the dissident, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban displaced persons arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain under the shadow.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "merceners" or "employants" in the payment of their declared enemy, the United States.
The Cuban television has taken account of the demonstration of pro-government combatants against "revolutionary opponents".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A force officer kills an octogene on the coast and makes 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-wheeled army killed an octogene and injured five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of fluency, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28, would have been struck with two knifes and for undisputed reasons, an octogenate, in or in front of an 85-year-old Jean-Jaurez, had been trained by police and witnesses.
He was badly injured, the old man, born in 1929, according to a police union officer Alliance, died in the hospital of his injuries.
In or in the same pharmacovigilance, he was then taken to a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged thirty, was interrupted and injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenaire was injured.
The days of the other injured are in danger, and vital organs are apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman was then ill and would have been hospitalized "in shock status", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then be thrown into the street, always bulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have hurt two pasts, apparently in hazard: a 30-year-old and a quarter-year-old, the last cry.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two loudspeakers that he carried behind his back, explained on the spot a leader of the Alliance union in the Highs-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
Several past, including young people, have tried to master the force, according to the AFP's evidence.
I've seen a kind of thirty-year-old with a green dress.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was expensive, reported Alberto, a servant of a bar nearby.
A crowd fell on him, and a municipal cop who broke the poignet added it.
Every day Jean-Jourès boulevard, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, who were responsible, tried to destroy the armed man and were injured by poking, according to police sources.
The facts have been produced in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main artists, where there are many shops.
I've been told that there was someone hurt out there.
I came out, I saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important cry in the abdominal, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmaceutical.
Five minutes later, a second person of a thirty-year-old was arrived, wounded by a knife.
These are the effectiveness of the national police who arrested the person who had been seized of identity papers.
The Nanterre Park has been investigated by the Department of Justice of the Highs-de-Seine Police (SDPJ 92).
The force was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not been heard in his vision.
A police source did not exclude him from being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers failed to master Clichy's police commission, where he was removed.
It was "in an emergency state" as "all the forces of this species whose forces perform under the influence of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again complains about the delay of prosecutions
The French-Polanski film lawyer Roman Polanski once again claimed a new Thursday in Los Angeles, West California, U.S.A., the delay in the prosecution against his client, currently assigned to Switzerland for more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the "Pianist", denounced three judges in the appeal court of the second district of California for serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I claim the absence of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the shower".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has been dead since -- would have discussed, before making his judgment, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski was sentenced to prison -- which is a serious error of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, researched and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared that at the end of September he had "false" to the author of the documentary.
In the case where the court refused to give up the proceedings, Mr. Hummel claimed that he had a trial, which would allow him to provide evidence of his arguments.
The charge was reopened by the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski did not present himself before the court.
The film, 76 years old, had disappeared from the United States in 1978, before its sentence was pronounced, for "unlawful sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He has never given up his feet to the United States since.
The Deputy Prosecutor of the Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself to the audience".
In this case, do you want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, which is possible?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the cinematist "questions a favor to the court, while he abuses his authority."
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed to him that there were other alternatives to escape.
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the withdrawal of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, once more, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being angry at every rebuff of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure has been just.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to stay in his wheelchair in Gstad, waiting for any extradition.
Wall Street finished without direction, frozen by the increase of the dollar
The New York Forum ended without direction on Friday, in a market driven between better indicators than planned in the United States and the increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while Nasdaq, a technological dominant, left 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The larger standard index & Poor's 500 has grown from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, raised Mace Blacksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchange has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend has been supported by the publication of better economic indicators, which "has contributed to improving the market's view on the strength of economic recovery", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second month and much more than planned.
In addition, the US consumer's confidence has been accurately renewed in December, at 73.4 versus 67.4 a month ago, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indicators have been hampered by a new progress in the dollar, at the top of two months in front of the euro, which is "the lowest sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explains Owen Fitzpatrick of the Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost the ground.
The compulsory market has fallen.
The performance of the Tresor's 10-year-old benefit increased to 3,540% against 3,482% Wednesday night, and that from 30-year-old to 4,497% against 4,492% of the guard.
Miss World's Election Again in South Africa
After a month of periple across South Africa, 112 candidates under Miss World are ready to launch Saturday the last right line to achieve their dream: be chosen by the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already broken their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta du Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sports or even Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real tourbill.
Visiting such beautiful towns as Port Elizabeth, Durban and the Cap was wonderful.
I've seen so many things and I've had so many experiences, Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which took place for the ninth time in South Africa, has been sent directly from Midand, north of Johannesburg, from 1700 (1500 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to send my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, points out Ms. Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Australian summer.
For young Russians, his second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with candidates and recovering "the lands to cut the rain in this country".
After a month of gala, repeats, meetings with the press and Safari, the Mission is now focusing on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presented to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood's star.
It's the dream of any woman to be the most beautiful of the world, but it's nothing but appearance.
We are the Ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will focus on this 59th edition.
The candidates will appear in traditional custom and certainly in bathroom mail.
The show will be animated by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a committee member Ms. Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that she was able to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to equal, says Ms. Monde, Julia Morley.
As in last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous town, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who closed their hand.
Not running for a Head of State, note Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will no doubt be taken to Cape (south-west) for the World Cup of football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote a little more the event.
I've had a lot of people I never thought I could approach.
I will no doubt come back for the 2010 World, I am excited to Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallday's news is "very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on his arrival at the Los Angeles airport where he had to go to the hospital's father's head for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, said to the press David Hallyday at his departure from the plane that took him from Paris shortly after 13H00 locals (21H00 GMT).
The son of the singer, the air stopped, made sure that he was going to become "very fast" at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a follow-up infection during the operation of a distal hernie on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was "placing this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to manage his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed as an artificial by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to a follow-up infection on November 26th in Paris.
The singer had to be reopened in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, was taken to the French school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade, to attend a school show, found a photograph of the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatic surgery at the Pitié-Salpétriere Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would return to Los Angeles next week to the singer.
The producer was the victim of Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgery who performed the singer on November 26th at the Monceau International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were gone, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thought Johnny Hallyday was "part too fast for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this online doctor who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and that I was shocked, since I had myself two years of schooling, he added.
Not before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "partless, without anything" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had performed the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a Neully-sur-Seine clinic where he was operating at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematom following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor of sulfate reputation, convicted of several instances by justice, in medically responsible files, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" who continued "regularly" before the Order Council, which is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday by his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "very well off" and post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore didn't require the position of a dragon," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since that summer, seems to be among the parents.
Of course, a resume of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens, dllr) as planned, which seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Association has increased the tone and is no longer using the New Centre
The UDF, controlled by the MoDem de François Bayrou, responded on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the ground of the former gyscardin, while still using it on no support, under trial.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF signal, judging that François Bayrou should not defend his political heritage after he held his hand on the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy before the NC National Council on Saturday.
In support of its approach, he received support from Mr Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP) who reselled the UDF brand for the first time to deposit it to the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, UDF's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to leave their seats, came out of his silence to launch a permanent appointment with the Minister and the Member, the sum of not using the bike and passing them the property of the brand, under trial.
You have multiplied, in recent days, statements indicating that you are willing to propose to your political movement to +retain+ the UDF signal, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also think it's good to follow on your military equipment and on your site's watch page, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the logo +the UDF today+, also features mail signatures.
As you don't know, you have no right to use this cycle, explain the UDF's office that still keeps the NC "soon the mention of the UDF name of any support and (soon) website".
He also asked Hervé de Chartet "to transfer the property of (the) mark to his legitimate legal advocates".
If you do not do so, the courts would be able to comply with the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories would be prevented.
In their e-mail, they state that UDF "is a completely political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF signal (Union for French democracy).
They also recall that the latest UDF conference voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the training based on Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Chartet, the office continued, "when he put the mark," he was not "more adhesion than UDF for three years," but to UMP.
It uses scandalously and deceitfully the lack of deposition of UDF acronym to make it for its account.
This indelictism is being turned into crime, they declare, before ironing on the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more honorable to make a name by itself than to try to get out of anonymity by taking a false name that we have no right."
Case Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The Nanterre court decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier on Friday to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenaire for the splintering of a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime of a maximum of three years imprisonment and a fine of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will be a good trial in this case of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter still rest while holding the lines of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
However, the 15th correctional room also ordered that a medical expert at 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted jointly by three doctors.
The main owner and shareholder of the Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Park during the investigation.
Doctors designated on Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010 including whether Liliane Bettencourt could be found in a state of weakness and during what period.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to him, and he told me that Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kieiman, came out of the audience.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent new... The expert will show that he (Mr. Banier) managed this elderly lady to be protected, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter engaged in criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and touch-up artist, who claims to have benefited during the years of her mother's weakness in order to obtain a billion euros of presents, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master tables.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by the photograph, which she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' complaints sometimes turned into a large family breakdown on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer made three letters sent by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said she hated the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 email, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to speak to him since his marriage."
The Nanterre Park has again considered that the complainant was not eligible to act, so much more than one judge of the guards has refused these last days to grant his request for a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to act in justice, she is not protected and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the public ministry, Marie-Christine Daubignney.
The court finally decided that it would be announced once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have come...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees reminds us of the position of consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about adding employees to "values" determined above, as it was sometimes, to impose on consumers of products thought by the device technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has given rise to market conquistadore strategies in place... although the authoritarian attempt to impose cut-off products from customer preferences is regularly returned!
Demobilization of employees can result in fatal demorrhage.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a much more general phenomenon affecting particularly the frameworks.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, including R&D and, more important, economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE "needs all stakeholders (...) a pro-active approach and a prospective vision" ; it requires employees to make a commitment that the administrative revenue is totally contrary to.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be the focus of the company's concerns on the same subject as the client.
The use of all relevant internal opinion surveys
Internal opinion surveys – how does the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I don't think so.
- First of all, because I've found that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally arrives, after all the deserts, to do priority... what it has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, increases proportionally the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behavior.
In addition to major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behavior theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. neurosciences and widely disseminated, in their opinion, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, suggesting that the "Leviers" (sic) of the framework commitment are possible, a recent Ipsos survey published in the Figaro.fr comforted the leaders in a mechanical governance post, which is not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobility factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution needed for the proper functioning of modern enterprises implies a definitive vision of human behavior.
It consists of incorporating, in any reason or practice of governance, a fundamental statement: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve some of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
Currently, only studies from the Moti-functional Analysis have adopted this concept of employees' motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a standard dose that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, business managers can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and administer human resources "to the place".
They thus create an area conducive to the development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: " just war" worth right-wing praises to Obama
The U.S. right welcomed the speech delivered on Friday in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 had defended the concept of "just war" against the U.S. enemies.
The conservators, who had cancelled the award award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, hailed this time the presidential speech, at the invitation of Sarah Palin, former vice-presidential candidate at the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the daughter of the Republican party's right wing, in USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the subject of the "sometimes necessary" war in her memory that will be published.
The war is well understood in my opinion that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
You have to stop these terrorists all over there, she's in love.
Mr. Obama, who ruled two wars by his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, used Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the president had done the "very good job" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was very good, and I congratulate the former President of the Chamber of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential issue.
On the other hand, I found this historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, questioned on the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former election, considered by some as a possible candidate for the presidential election in 2012, was said to have seen "a left president" remind the Nobel Committee that "they would not be free and could not restore a price of peace if the appeal did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former poet George W. Bush converted chronicler to Washington Post, Mr. Obama said "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting themselves in "world citizens" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a safe hole that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr. Gerson.
Among the rares to be not convinced, a fashion of Bush's age, former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, has qualified for the talk of "tele, ampoule and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
On the right hand of the President, Democrat representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When war is covered in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, it has been preserved.
However, the pressure of the centre-gauch remained high at the position of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that Nobel had been awarded earlier to Mr. Obama, qualified his "super-production" award even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should be used as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression" was launched on the California daily.
Mr. Obama "proclaimed the speech he had failed," said New York Times, judge "at the same time as a shadow and building".
Roads: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
Following three Marathon negotiations, the trade unions in the road sector and TLF, the only parental organization to remain until the end of the day, came to an agreement that ended with the word of strike and the serious threat to Christmas supplies.
At the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoui" of the agreement, after several negotiations, was held on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same if three parental organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting started at 11100 so that the whole world would agree and the text would be signed at 1800.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "he was afraid that he would be disturbed by the end of the year," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At an hour's rate, for low-sales, "it's going from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
It's not a big thing, but some very far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
That's what we're going to tell our fighters that there's no blockades, no blockages of raviling centres.
But we can always have some refreshing things that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "hard to grant increases on the high-paying account of international competition".
According to him, increases will be from EUR 170 per month for the low wages and from EUR 100 to EUR 120 for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for the reassessment of 3 per cent of the travel costs and the maintenance of the general state of road transport by the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the 13th month issue and modernization of the collective convention.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in parental charges" had been made under a government amendment to the draft amending Finance Act for 2009, which was voted on Friday night by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote in the "identical term".
The TLF signature allows the agreement to apply for the first time to companies associated with that organization, and the second time, to all professions, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
She'll be "in the shortest few days," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of parental organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "puppet market", because the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to compensate for a portion of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to contradict the teeth of the next revelation, he disappointed Unostra.
For the other, the agreement could be "to increase the level of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this week-end, inconsistencies of RATP's proposals
The disturbances on RER A, the largest urban common transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on 2nd day between trade unions and RATP's leadership left them on their hunger for their first request.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important week of purchases before Christmas, there will be only between 1000 and 2000 trains due to two trains on the central throne (between the Defence and the Nation) and four trains outside the central throne.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallerys, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, are pleased that "RATP makes efforts to serve large stores".
The RER A through the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP throne is short from Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Friday, about a train on two went around at the time of the point, and almost no frame in the credential hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there was no doubt about what, the French were organized.
So in the early morning, the St. Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much more frequent than usual, especially because of the absence of colleagues and Lycians.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old Jack Nbakina explained that he had been raised "a 30-hour earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not know of satisfaction, said the SNCF, which had provided for a framework of agents and forces in the order.
The A RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Sergey-Le-High arrived or shared from the Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
New general meetings of the Grévists will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will consider the results, judged "magres" by the unions, of a meeting with the direction of Friday after noon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career delay, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a first two, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its first proposals among parents, the CGT was ignored, stressing that the direction "was not designed to solve a problem while in the road and the SNCF was done".
A new meeting is planned on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of exercise of the profession", the RATP said.
What has also been said to trade unions that the company was "moving users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had been assigned to a construction committee in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, which had so far refused any discussion during the strike, suggested that the meeting should be "in an interest in employment".
The conflict threatens to extend to RER B Tuesday, after the deposit of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions claim a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150 of EUR 30 variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to millions of passengers daily.
RER drivers, both in the second part of the career, reach EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 gross and EUR 600 to EUR 650 premiums, for broken hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice comes from the pro-curding party, a heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the resolution of the main pro-Kurde party in the country, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to be a major challenge for the Government, which has just held its hand to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a “study of harmful activities to the independence of the State and its individual unit”, said the President of the Court Hasim Kilic, at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven were required to declare the resolution, said Mr. Kiliç, adding that 37 of the members of the party, including his President Ahmet Türk and Mr. Aysel Tugluk, are behind political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity that Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk had received and the confiscation by the party's Treasurer.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (over 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalčinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) as a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
A number of observers estimate that the DTP is the legal political vine of the PKK rebellions.
The party, however, ensures that it does not have an "organic link" with the PKK but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and calls on the Government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s verdict is that the Government has just handed over to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights to try to bring the Kurds back to the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had stated that a solution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in the South-East Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan have been in force with the police during the past few weeks.
From the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the big city of the south-east was mostly inhabited by Kurdes.
The order forces pulled the lacymogenes and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched molotov cocktails or stones, with brakes.
A hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of the Court would "enforce despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (kurde, dllr) by prohibiting a party, he said to the press.
The Government, formed by a part of the Islamic movement, also deplores the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This did not resolve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total tolerance of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Island.
We can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK to be added.
Thursday, the PKK won an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Braubuer wants is a very strict winter.
However, the administrator of the road degradation and sanding service (FES) makes it clear that this is not to embezzle citizens.
It's just that the agents can test the vehicle technique and learn to master them well.
And according to meteorologists, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and snow.
The FES is following a very well-designed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that since he was on fire in the city of Frankfurt and that the temperatures fell below zero, 20 main roads (known as road A) were covered by large sand vehicles.
This includes the streets with great circulation, the main art, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
It also includes pumping access, common transport tunnels, Pieton areas, and paint streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers start their service at three o'clock in the morning.
Where necessary, the 1040 km of road must be reached with a road background that is well-adjusted, at 3 hours of maximum time.
That is why the FES service starts at 3 p.m. in the morning "in order for the roads to be dropped when the daily migration is started".
There or it gets more difficult, it's when the snow falls at 7:30 a.m.
This poses problems, we are told by the road degradation and sanitation service "because no car driver is willing to let the vehicles pass".
Then, if it does not swim anymore, there are access routes and desert routes - such as the Council-Beil-Straße.
The secondary roads and the lateral roads will come to an end.
Mr. Braubuer knew that this was always a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team is on its way to give priority to dangerous areas and crossings.
With regard to the cycle track, EES services cannot generally take place.
Mr. Braubuer stated that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the status of points between 22 and 430 hours.
As the glass becomes very rapidly on these surfaces, the sales vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
It is also possible for the police to call on this special service where necessary.
The denosaurs' Berry
The Tawa hallae was similar to the other carnivore dinosaurs: this bipede measured about 2 meters long for 1,50 m high, its later members were powerful, its long neck was covered with acrepited teeth, its short arms were cut off by fluffy flues and it had a long neck.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had no exceptions.
However, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the journal Science de juudi, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal was alive 215 million years ago in New Mexico, where it was the age of part of the land of the supercontinent, and was located in the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of the Light Tawa of a new day was the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it tells us about the parentheses, the division and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt took on the website of Gohst Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Natural History Museum of Utah and a member of the team of fools tells them that sometimes they had to find a dozen ossems in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary cup from the Trias.
Scientists are very quick to realize that some of these crops belong to a new species.
The leaves have updated the remaining five species.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers baptized her in the name of Tawa according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs coming from Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bone.
All paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of Bonn University does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, but it does specify that it can confirm certain theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all first dinosaurs.
Experts ask each other when the saurians are divided into three major groups of evolution: theropodes (carnivores) which include tyrannosaure and later velociraptor and which come down birds, sauropodes, long-term quadrupeds, and those who belong to them and the Ornithian herbivores which form part of species such as triceratops and stégosarium.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first therapists.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found indications that the Tawa hall had small air bags in its ears at the level of the skull, as well as birds that are the descendants of the therapists.
These small air bubbles facilitate the breathing of birds in relation to mammals.
It seems that at the Tawa hall, the greens were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest therapists presenting small air bags in his bones.
As the apparent line of the sauropodes immens also had air bags and a slight ossation, it may be thought that their common ancestors already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive migration waves to North America.
As the most famous dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the saurians appeared there.
As a result, the three great lines of development have been divided and separated from South America to the rest of the world, namely the entire emerging countries that formed the supercontinent of Panama.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologist team has also discovered the remains of two other theories that are not particularly relevant to it.
The three species cannot come down from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advance researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History in New York and the assistant of Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three migration waves to North America.
He heard some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silesaura, who lived in the present Poland and belongs to a group belonging to dinosaurs.
This could be mistaken because in South America there are a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while there are practically none of them on other continents.
On the other hand, as dinosaurs have been able to become the dominant tetrapodes of the secondary age while they have a relatively rare collateral line from the spinal cord, still remains a mystery today.
In the days of Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of current crocodiles and many other sauriants.
At the end of the Trias dinosaurs were distributed across the planet to promote the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between Trias and Jurassique.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction in which dinosaurs survived in an alleviated manner, while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or, then, dinosaurs were better adapted and could therefore eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the loss of a favourable metrore of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias, which had since been born in the shadow: it was the Mammifers.
The Solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are global signatures.
There are teachers from Toronto University, Cambridge University, Vienna University or Berkeley University in California.
There are those who are in charge of the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Breme.
The evacuation by the casino police at the University of J.W. Goethe de Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 teachers and teachers at J.W. Goethe University, but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students of the Westend Camp.
In a statement published in German and English, the police intervention claimed by the board of directors of the university is hidden.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in a hurry after walls and works of art had been barbulated from graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories argue that degradations did not justify "a so violent intervention by the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Eviction is an “inadmissible attack” on freedom of research and education.
The fact that focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitize and criminalize protest" and tries to forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The Board of Directors of the University thus held discussions that would nevertheless be necessary.
Course charges require immediate suspension of criminal proceedings.
Most employees did not take part in degrading.
Legislativeization of protests
The youth of the Verdi Syndicat of the Service Sector and the German Federation of Syndicats (DGB) show strong students.
The protests are just the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary of Youth of the Verdi Union.
With regard to the Ministry of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took the initiative of the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the places is totally unacceptable, she said to the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday at the current TV issue.
We understand the sense of protests but do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU member of the regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (the Link) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler from La Gauche (Link)
Instead of reflecting on students' arguments and claims, we evacuate them.
The part La Gauche submitted a motion to the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The New Silicon City
For a long time she had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden by Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a secret weapon research site under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants at 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are installed there.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, instead of French sciences – with universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were mutual meetings and last Wednesday of the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg, which ratified a "Special Cooperation Protocol".
The signatories were Moscow's Vice-President Juri Rosljak and the chief Anatoly Smiv of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific change
It's a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
There is the Institute of Electronics in Moscow, the major Sitronics and Rossijskaja-Elektronika companies.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Ville green") takes his name from the forests in the heart of which the research centres are installed.
Project S21: a bridge for Stuttgart
We can't enjoy the extent of the Stuttgart 21 project.
For his party this is nothing less than a "new heart of Europe".
If you want it, S21 is much more than the introduction of a railway train, more than a colossal construction project that will extend the heart of the Bade-Wurtemberg capital, in a chaos of desperate singing for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The railways, with roads ending in full city, had the reputation at the time of being the relic of the 19th century transport technology, which had an effect on modern rail traffic as it needed a lot of time to pass the rear locomotics ahead.
Come, stop short, start – that's what you have to do.
That's why line coaches have to be fired: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train pass station, located on the midway around the Trans-European Railway Magistrate between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, where the slogan "the heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost, in order to bring the rent into the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavière, was exorbitant.
In fact, line coaches have no more real problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with autorails and driver cars at both ends.
However, the implementation of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched along the new track from the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and Community policies have brought it.
The railway company is of the part because it is the contributor who makes the risk costs of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From a urban point of view, this project is relatively justified.
There is a urban space that – if you believe in computer-generated planners charts – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is unstable.
The passage station and the extension of the section are designed for the traffic of people to whom it was assigned - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was still no competition for good market flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening trade in goods because rail transport is much more respectable than by road.
But the new track, with its hints, is not suitable for marketing trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious than any other railway project.
For example, six billion euros will be included in the Souabe project.
It's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other points of connection and integration in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions in all sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be really urgent to support the champion here.
But the S21 project makes the effect of a freezing satellite.
The interior of the Rhine Valley is about to become the main source of international trade, and this is in the heart of Europe.
The Government reviews the judgement made on airport
In the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government of the Land has called for the decision of the Hesse Administrative Tribunal on the prohibition of air flights at night.
The Minister for Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition was responsible for examining experts from the legal point of view the judgement made by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had reasoned in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction project of the north-west landing track of Frankfurt airport would be carried out.
The authorization to attack 17 aircraft between 23h and 5h in the morning, as the Government of the Land considers, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to bring an action against the judgment made.
The opposition is critical at this time and tries to pressure the representative of the Government so that he can appeal to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The Head of the SPD Parliamentary Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections, which was to prevent night flights. Otherwise, it will be declared as a complete failure to a given word.
It's very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, by giving an address to the FDP's electoral slogan "We have our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch rejects Schäfer-Gümbel's claims that the Government of the Country is trying to authorize even night flights using "the lawyer and robbery".
There is a need for time for a precise legal review.
Coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first fast-pressure".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the declarations of its section on the prohibition of night flights is completely groundless.
The American banks pay for the aid granted
The large American banks, which are deeply affected by the crisis, are from their ties towards the State.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed EUR 45 billion (more than EUR 30 billion), corresponding to the aid provided under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. C.C.T.T.C.T.C.T.C.T.C.C.C.C.Citigroup also considered reimbursing the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to remove the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of allowances allocated to managers and the higher costs regulation.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital through the sale of securities to investors who reported to it $19 billion.
The rest of the sum comes from bank cash that are well-filled through the sale of several branches in other sectors.
Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director-General of the Bank of America, expressed appreciation for the American taxpayers: capital injection has helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capacity by withdrawing Merrill Lynch's investment bank into the strongest financial distortion.
The Citigroup also intends to seek money on financial markets in order to free itself from the State's guardianship.
The U.S. bank could thus launch a 20 billion-dollar capital increase on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain on banking environments.
Citigroup's password did not want to comment on this information.
In June the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had reimbursed the public funds they had received.
Accelerationd selection
Finally everything happened even faster than planned.
Two weeks after the removal of the current editor's position in chief Nikolaus Brender by the German chain Administration Board of ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The Committee wished to vote yesterday to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who led the Berlinese edition of the ZDF, was a great favour.
However, the chain did not want to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
It appears, however, that there was also the desire not to give any greater weight to ZDF Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Governing Council.
Frey, who is the candidate for Schächter, needed 9 members of the Commission vote on 14.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend the five-year contract to Nikolaus Brender, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had been declared favouring the redundancy of Brender and 7 others had voted against.
In fact, the CDU, who is majority in the Governing Council, had already been allowed to hear several weeks before the vote, did not want to re-enter Brender.
This is Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of Hesse's Land, who had organized a link with the editor-in-chief.
He had refused that the contract of highly valued editor-in-chief would be extended by calling for the level of hearing of ZDF's information issues to be reduced under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost to the vote, undermining the growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, there were 35 public law experts who were involved in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was anti-constitutive.
But that won't work.
Peter Frey, who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied the sciences-political, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in the Southwestfunk (Radio Organ of Rhénani-Palatinate) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national port Kuwait).
In 1983 he became a editor within the ZDF at the latest in the journal's journal (Today's Journal).
Then it continued: from 1988 to 1990, it was the assistant of the editor-in-chief of the period; then, corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998, he was the head and presenter of the "Morgengmagazins" (Bimenual Information issue presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then the head of the Berlinese edition.
After Brender's gratitude, while he was just elected journalist of the year by the Specialized Medium Magazine, the Verts announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent to the Governing Council, Minister-President of Rhenanie-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so as not to be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of the political personality of the ZDF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of Brender, had been working closely with the Governing Council by criticising the committee with veneer in his decision to immigrate Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalism, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, as well as the Board of Directors could save it without supporting a political party's position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is ranked liberally on the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partly successful for students: after a year's educational crisis, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Countries decided to show themselves more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors Conference, an agreement was made to provide that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to ease the weight of the examinations: a single examination must allow the selected study module to be closed.
In addition, the burden of work will need to be reconsidered in order to ensure "real and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of studies between universities and abroad.
The Landers are also committed to organizing more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master rows.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulations from one country to the other.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of student protests in last June, the Ministers for Education of the Countries and the Rectors of universities have consistently expressed the expression "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to significantly reduce the number of exams: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single review", read in a document of thirty pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by reducing the burden of exams, the delays should be stopped, which would significantly undermine the studyability.
The "studyability" should continue to be the crucial criterion of the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if we can't avoid this feeling of exacerbation that we sometimes feel in the selection of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to recent knowledge in the RAID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate trumpeting.
Students should "have the opportunity and the margin of work necessary to allow and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will apply to access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "recredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that in 2015 it is only that all cycles will be examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils established by the Landers.
In October, the Minister of Education had put some pressure on the Lands to rely on agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the review regime was not too strict.
In some countries, universities and higher schools have already been heard with their regional departments to take appropriate action.
Rhenanie-Palatinate has so far been the only country to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities are required to organize programmes aimed at strengthening the educational orientation offices as well as the review offices and the service of international relations.
The Länder and the universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wanted to submit to Parliament an amendment to the higher education institutions Act.
It will then need to pass only one review to close its studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, and it must be possible to ensure the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions, and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of the next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and opposition again discussed the question of the study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but the criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Association of Social Students said he would like the organization of education policy to no longer go to the future "after closed doors" of Ministers and university Rectors.
At the latest after the educational crisis, students as persons concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received support from the President of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful" said yesterday when meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Countries with whom HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the union of education and sciences (GEW) decisions made in Bonn will not be far enough. He claims the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduated to enroll in a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks the Länder to provide the Bachelor students today, that there will be enough space for Master studies and conditions of study as well as possible.
The countries therefore have to bear more of the burden of training.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education have not mentioned the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than one bottom note on Herta Müller
It is by these words "He arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." which begins a work of poet Werner Søllner, in which he is thematic in the brebes of confusing phrases, the experiences of a dissident who has come to Germany to gain freedom but has lost his linguistic territory at the same time.
Werner Søllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first German and English professor in Bucharest and then the director of the collection in a youth's publishing house before installing himself in Frankfurt on Main.
Søllner received different literary prices; in 1993 he was the very famous poet of the University of Goethe de Francefort, and since 2002 he has been the director of Hesse's literary forum at the house of the artist of Moussonturm in Frankfurt.
He talked a lot about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, where the theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror that deforms your security files".
Apparently destabilized and génétat, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow Romanian fellow writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer who had collaborated as an informer for the Political Police Security.
Søllner received the German price in 1989 together with some of the participants.
Rotating tests had begun in 1971.
I am, I conclude, Söllner concludes, "so someone who has not had enough to resist the threat of security."
Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
At the same time, close to the respect of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary works with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene is clear and particularly the community of the original German authors of Romania, by a case that clearly shows the ambitions and the decline of a political system based on police surveillance and spying.
Werner Søllner is, as far as we can say according to current knowledge, not only embarrassing but also vulnerable.
In his own security file, IM Walter played a role, ensuring the specialist in the literature Michael Markel after Sölner's confession and he referred to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favor.
"He could have taken it out of all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and was unexpected in front of this audience, however, the existence of an old dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is not really so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reservation for the spies of the Security had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper " Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
It may be assumed that victims would have made speculations and sometimes become real names that were later hiding the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where the consultation of Stasi's files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the security files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been without delay opposed and frozen in the past years.
In 1999 only a national council corresponding to the Birthler Institute was created to work on the Assimilation of Security Archives (CNSAS) but the restoration of files has just been under way.
There has been a law that defines the management of archives since 2005.
The influence of former members of the security in Romania is still very high, confirmed by the interview of an old security officer of Temesvar who, after the Nobel Prize was announced in Herta Müller, expressed three dedependence in respect of the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and at the end of the day, we only asked her once.
The infamilies of power thought they could express themselves here, without any genes, under the protection of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inequitable issues are associated with Søllner's case as often as they are in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been shot? The weighted reaction of the audiences, like Søllner, lets hope that the follow-up of this chapter will be better defined by a purpose of knowing that it is due to accusations and a sense of shame.
On the Genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Tumulants at the League Championships
We had the impression that a representative arrived there, taken to four temples coming to the right of a Christmas festival, on which the sports item manufacturer had placed his goods when the new VFB Christian Gross trainer mounted at least a quarter in a Class C Mercedes, which he just had to call, an orange plastic bag from the supplier's hand.
The man, whose key chest attracted attention, was allowed to drive into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, our fifty-year-old could have taken his own volition – he didn't have a good alcohol and he wasn't no longer happy.
It had been a pleasant evening but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because it's now that it's about to begin.
The words of Switzerland that we were going to undertake three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth end," that is, in the language of the champions by our 3:1 against the Urzicen Union of Romania, but we must not let ourselves be deceived by success. It will be a brutal struggle to not return."
The "great work" awaits us tomorrow.
There, it is about repeating the results of the campaign's daily link to Mainz.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have surfaced after the three expeditions of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sorting
The eighth final of the League Championships (match to 16/17. + 23/24 February/ match returns 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be held in Nyon on December 18.
The joy of the entry into service of the successor of Babel was then moderate.
And the joy was not measured only by the one who had taken the chance, who had handed down to the disabled workers of Stuttgart, a relentless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I saw the players and I told them that they should focus on their tattoos, I advised them to be more courageous, explaining the "flamming of souls" – Gross – the success of the dreaming so well that it no longer had any effect with the owner of Babel.
He started some magic, avoya Jens Lehmann - apartsan of Babbel - "in the foot when there's a new impulse it sometimes happens to things that we would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of rest for pain, progressed to the rank of the best player through his dynamism, tries to describe the "fenomone" found by a proverbial "cost wind" and the working method of the new head: "It's someone who goes through action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babel was missing.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the head yet, keeps the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart has been especially in need of tenacity.
Like Gross, players and managers are careful to make sure that the victory against a completely excessive and weak defence of Romanian guests is overrated.
They had also won at Glasgow before having had four days later a bad revelation in Leverkusen with the 0:4 object Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, notes that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't had a hard time yet.
That Heldt's 40th anniversary was not the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, is the event of the weekend that a television interview of the goal guard Jens Lehmann was rebuffed just before the start of the match.
There are decisions others make and not Jens, against Heldt, in response to Lehmann's criticism.
He accused the head of style weakness and said that he had decided to change trainer under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of release after the match had been deleted.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a purely egoism" enfoça Heldt and annotated the consequences for the target guard.
They no longer risk becoming friends with these two quadrennials.
In any case, they agreed to the rest, that without the team's prior work by the coach replaced, strong sports and combative representation would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “a large part of the success” who returned Heldt and Lehmann to the heart – and even the man to the plastic bag acquired.
Championship your world weights Lords
The hot battle in Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenger won without these words and at this moment the champion of the Vitali Klitschko world.
But after twelve difficult rounds, Ukraine defends its world champion of heavy weight after the WBC Federation's version.
In the uniformity of judges, he shall be subject to points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko maintains its title of champion of the world of heavy weights.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the point of unanimity against American judges Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends with honor his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
The World Championship of the WBO and WBC federations had already won twice before.
Unfortunately, KO has failed so much.
Klitschko, born 39 times in 41 professional battles, has twice reported his failure due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In Arrene de Berne, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to condemn the battle, above its height of 2,02 meters, by its left.
Johnson, less than ten inches [11 cm] long before the darkness, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, successfully avoiding the fall of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from playing his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has been particularly trying to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his boots did not reach the champion very rarely.
He is even the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, has passed the 12 rounds distance with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the battle.
Klitschko insults the treatment of "Zombie Vilain" which "is not really capable".
During the Friday night's plague, the champion could not prevent Johnson from causing him to fall down his sunlights of the nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko has been reintroduced during his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a four-year break, he fought the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "his" WBC century that he had before left without the fight.
This year, defending his champion's title, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez de Cuba and in September against Chris Areola of the United States.
"I just took a break in this fight and was in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Vladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it's British David Haye who, detaching the great Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, wears the WBA's belt.
This year, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was supposed to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotion company is planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defense of Gutenberg of a lie in the case of the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (the Link Day) request the explanation channel.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on Kunduz Air Attack, the opposition called on the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) to have deliberated certain facts.
The Minister deliberately "formed a controversy" on the murder of two tankers in September last, said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the release of information from the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he's lying.
The order to kill was given to the full violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
In substance, the content of the report contained by NATO, which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media discoveries, the aim of the lafrappe was indeed, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to NATO's investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured during the American Air Attack, which had been launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein, Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Gauche asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak in the shortest time before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Greens Renate Kunast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly state whether the target mass strategy is part of the Afghan Government's federal policy if the Chancellor, Army and Information Services have approved this new strategy.
The Government's speech categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery had no influence on the military's intervention in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, the vote was made more strongly to express doubts as to the possible reasons for the resignation of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert, as had been presented by the Ministry.
According to the information in the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had sent to Gutenberg regarding the attack on tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have distinguished the existence of the NATO report and hid some of the relevant details to the Minister.
In the context of the two senior officers, it is understood that they reported to the Department of Defence several reports, including a document on two pages from Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The "Frankfurter General Sontagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have been asked in an e-mail to clarify the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer
Saturday, the Ministry did not want to comment on these charges and referred them to the Federal Parliament's investigation committee, which would be the following Wednesday to bring light on the facts.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, however, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is nothing but mental illness, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As these phenomena occur during the summer, everything's going to be fine.
When we are extended into our bedrooms assobriety, we are able to adapt without obstacles to the most common dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, consciously, makes the experience of dreaming, hears and sees things that others do not understand, has speeded up the reputation in our western world of being mad or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices appear only in mental illness or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is the cause: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint tables or write novels, but it sometimes influences the boundaries between dream, fantasy and reality.
A state of consciousness, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most different forms, in the best of the cases called vision, at the top of the sheet.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the so-called, psychosis and hallucinations are imputable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or deliriums when the balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - first and foremost, dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delicate thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The earth's attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always thought about the relationship between the follicle and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a dream form; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, found in 1861 "a great similarity between the follicle and the dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that make it."
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a design band.
Its body is in two dimensions created colors.
The earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it's about the ceiling.
He's feeling a bit.
Behind him he has ally-like, glamorous devil creatures, the infamous mouth, showing teeth.
They continue to give him feet with heavy flashing boots, he jumps against the walls, he feels pain in the whole body.
Tonnourishing, mechanizing, screaming, coming out of walls and radio.
He can no longer support those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo channel, actually a bottle and attachs it to a crochet attached to the ceiling.
He rides on a baffle and walks through the hole around the neck.
He's welcome.
The hole's falling apart.
That's a lesson for you, the voices cry in a heart to pull the tempan. "Go to a clinic and make yourself look good!"
Today, 40-year-old Henning T. has had six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
She was fired by the LSD.
Diagnostic: psychosis schizophrenia, paranoid, in addition to maniaco-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis, I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffer at least once in their life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics, the most common after depression is the disease.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned are no longer able to make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they are in a state of great excitement, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relative follicles or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are no longer rare.
The person concerned can no longer make the difference between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the conscience is sealed under the senses.
Like the dream, psychosis opens up the exclusions to a marina of ideas and ghosts from the deeper pieces of conscience.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the CHU Psychiatry Department of Heidelberg (General Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrene is located in the center of the situation, all of which is central to its meaning.
At the same time he is in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the ability to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, revealing is excluded.
Once in your life of hallucination.
Unlike dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality which is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved".
Delicate thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alignment of the veins has taken place in a real framework.
Because our brain makes this kind of knights, it's always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose the perception of reality at the moment, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposed to schizophrenia, but studies on gums have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers suggest that the people concerned are suffering from brain damage.
It is assumed that brain neuronal aging is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a mother’s viral infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which neuronal system anomalies occur and increase the fact that they do not occur for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a psychosis trigger, however, if there is a provision.
Halucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our coffee beer.
What's crazy is, we're told by Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medications to escape while others buy expensive drugs to search for them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusions over the past ten years: he published his results in a book entitled "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are part of typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis, but also an impressive number of other pathologies.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsis, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to note that in some cases even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally infected.
They form when the brain areas that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently cold; when our brain is warm but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this whole state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of motivation, stress, love chains or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, at least one third of the participants acknowledged having done at least once in their lives the experience of hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Meckleburg-Pomerania and going to the lake.
A young girl is always normal to say the truth.
If he didn't have the images and the voices.
During the rehearsal, it happens that a young boy, lying, to the long châtian hair, addresses the word to him.
When she answers her friends, she is surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy young girl is a ludicrous dream, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bank.
She can even see her presence right now.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this sympathic youth.
I'm crazy, she's asking you sometimes.
But she knows very well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the appearances are, in general, grueling.
The visions are often heavy.
When she's in class, it happens that she can't follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he's invisible to others and the teacher is obviously explaining equations to the table.
At night the appearances are, in general, grueling.
When, in the dark of her room, she waits for the dream that occurs too rarely and very late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or asleep already, if the images she sees, the glamorous faces or the young girl with bloody arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, call her to these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, they'd take it for a fool.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. today is 20 years old.
She had her bath last year and she lived with her friend.
One year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
The leaf is also an art work of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has not enough incentives, the probability is great that he has hallucinations for some time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so it's got animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was a child and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13 years old, that the man she called her father, since she was 13 years old, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience", according to Kasten "a place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to treat hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciences, we are unfortunately quick to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and doctor of the hospital's psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, creative - the folie is an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called oniroid, a particular form of change in the consciousness of the dream.
Oniroid vicues are very complex semi-smokers that are perceived as real by the living one and that he cannot even distinguish himself from sleep when he is awake.
The state of Oniroid consciousness occurs during trauma or extreme pathology situations as well as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of himself and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is disunited from reality.
It's a mental limit state between dream and hallucination.
As it is impossible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change has taken place but the real situation is represented in imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an incomprehensible situation, a capacity of organization that has been given to us men, not to mention in the birth of a lack of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Creation of the Heart" as a safeguard action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience was involved in a journey several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body was sentenced to remain immaterial in reanimation.
Clossen jumps into a world that has created all the parts, visiting foreign places, travel in time. He sees an old man high in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his head protecting his health.
He lives at the middle of his life among the nobles who manufacture blood-based drugs.
He was picked up by a Greek motorcycle who drove him to his country, slept with his hospital bed in the Alpes Nebula and met a huge Korean.
It completely absorbs itself in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Klaussen, these internal trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a whole different state, he writes in describing what he has lived.
In contrast to dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even in later years.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than the real vibe.
The intensity of this phenomenon is to clarify the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the Psychiatry Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oniroid deliries, psychosis, hallucinations and psychiatric experiences show us how our internal representations of external reality are fragile even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "may cause a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very enriching.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At 27 years of age, children will follow the house of education.
Kallen's appointment at the PDG post of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to be the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% of a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, editor Hubert Burda sees his company among the hands of his children
Both children will inherit 27 years of age and are firmly determined to integrate society, said Hubert Burda, 69, in Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then be raised.
They will also need to see if they can.
It cannot be imposed on its children to 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to take care of them.
That would destroy the children as well as the company.
Burda had told him last Thursday that he had returned from the position of President-General since January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Governing Council since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
It is therefore responsible for the Trésor sector and, after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, is also the head of the marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance sector.
So for the first time, this is not a family member who is the head of the Burda editions.
The children of Burda were 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment is also used to make the link for the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% among the family's hands.
The destructions have always occurred in families that have been allowed to run through a capital storm, which have caused enormous disappointment by thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I certainly do not see myself in the role of the country's predecessor as it could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these international links such as Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full Quality
All you can wish, in terms of beauty and well-being, by hand.
This is the objective that the English Court has set, which has just grown in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and care of the bodies.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, opens prestigious teachings such as Hedonai, laser epileptic specialist, Spaxion, with its rooms of relaxation and aesthetic treatment, Luis & Tachi, coffeemakers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or The Octatine and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a range of food, with particularly a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different varieties.
Spaxion offers you to take advantage of a relaxing massage with your partner, even considering the exceptional views on the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxing area to organize your own "Questy Party" with eight of your friends and to relax with a jacuzzi session, of massages all in front of a cup of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation to fight against cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The sports room also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the customer's steps, offering them an integrated personalized treatment.
Everything starts by introducing your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Many videos show us how to properly implement our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including drying and drying), enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after having done our body work, we want to pass through the kitchen room, Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer hair repair rituals, lightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusion seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.

Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with an electric car
Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona Association, created the "LIVE Office".
It is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'Offina LIFE' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric vehicle in the city and will place agreements on mobility by means of the procedures, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and work in the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities ”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Séville are joining the project.
It is three cities chosen by the Government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the launch of the electric car.
The Endesa electricity company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generality of Catalogue.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative on which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero involves "a future of peace" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, introduced "a future of peace" for the Spanish car industry, which he recalled is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year in order to support the car sector.
"In the absence of the Automobile Competitiveness Plan, we now have an outlandish landscape, closing some of our main production sites," the President of the Government said.
"With this plan and the decision to remain in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can look forward to a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including in the Integral Plan for the Car Sector (PIA), devoted 800 million euros to 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized investment of more than EUR 3,000 million.
The Executive Director explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government measures to support the application, in addition to the 2000E Plan, in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and has contributed to a "strong increase" in inflation, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Collection Hall, a meeting space for professionals and passengers from the world of the engine.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in Cristallon de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is a 20 000 m2 exposure area, where over 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
We will not only find motorcycles and pickup cars, but we will also find them in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of any kind connected to the engine world.
Thus, in the fuel exhibits, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, thumbnails, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring happiness to collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies we will find, among other things, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Cupe-France Poeche, sale and restoration of cars, or Classica Cochera, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
External aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this hall will also include parallel activities: meetings, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competition.
Attitude tests with car and collection motorcycles will also take place on a circuit located outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sport spirit is not limited to respect for the environment.
To this end, it has been integrated into the Mazda3 engine stop and start system, baptized i-Stop, a device that is, at least for the moment, available only on the 2.0 engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it received in its entirety.
Details, vehicle finish, habitat, behaviour, mechanical, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
At the beginning of the driving position, it is clear that the seating seats present excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the flyer is also particularly pleasing to him.
Continuing with the whole table of control and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese tendency to create a future interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as red and blue living colors.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are in contrast with the sovereignty of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to survive.
Continued with the room, this compact Japanese car offers more than adequate housing to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
It adds a great deal to the regular forms.
The automatic stop and start system of the engine, at least for the moment, is only available on the engine with two litres and 150 horses and with a manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real pleasure. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and the mastership of its consumption.
In fact, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a driving engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its mastered consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sports, i.e. the one that presents the largest number of series elements.
Among the series teams, the road change assistant (RVM) who removes the dead angle, tracking and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive internal mirror, the board computer on a large screen, stationers, independent air conditioning, rain and light capter, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as 17-power alignment routes, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment was not sufficient, this version had the Premium Pack which, for more than 1,500 euros, includes among other elements of the bio-xenon adaptable fairs and a BOSE audio system with disk load.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make a lot of miles per year will be able to choose for the i-Stop version associated only to the engine of 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only unconventional of this model is its high price, which is between EUR 21 770 for the completion of Luxury and EUR 23,270 for the tested model, Sportive.
In contrast to this important sum, Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
"First" of luxury
L.A. recovers the red tape of sensoryness incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever shown us, as elegant as sexys for Nine's exit. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a "lady" shade.
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to watch your email, without offering the opportunity to see certain types of joint parts or to navigate on the Internet.
He uses his five minutes of glory to the United States when Time magazine appoints him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly subscription, or less than half of what costs, for example, the date of iPhone subscription.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service, for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as his American brother, but it's a surprise.
The monthly subscription price, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to cancel the data when you cross a border or look for a coffee shop on the Wifi (or a connection from Fon) to be able to consult your mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and this makes it work for a long time.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I'm concerned, I would need to have a physical examination to understand them and good moons to read small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates throughout Europe have had a painful effect.
Outside of its country of origin, data is denied, and there is no damage.
A small device such as the FonPeek (he is always curious that he is called Fon while he does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariff, meaning that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals to enable them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, including downloading books and other online research.
No subscription and no gallery.
It's a connected device and we pay it when we buy it and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: an option to buy with access to life like Peek has already been offered to the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my e-mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
The default color for Michelle
The yellow is undoubtedly the preferred colour of the first lady in the United States.
If Barack Obama took office at the United States Presidency with a dress and a mask of that colour, she has actually chosen the same thing to accompany him at the second time, no doubt the most important thing in her life: the return to Oslo of the Nobel Prize for Peace.
Michele Obama had a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow to the green with bright reflections, both of which were made of three pieces: the garment, the garment and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large brothel or a necklace.
Although from the first time on, it would seem that the first lady of the United States would follow the seal of the Asturias Princess and have chosen to return the same ones.
But the fabric in which the two sets are scaled makes them very different.
If it was for the function it was for a spanish tooth, instead, it would bring a printed virus to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: white to medium-sized shoes for the first occasion, and a similar model, but expensive, this time.
The coat has also changed: hair is now raised while it was worn out the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what is revealed in the study “Fecondity and career of women in Spain”, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey, conducted in 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their limited professional career due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences as to the start of marriage and the number of children, if the woman works or not and the type of employment she is employed.
Those who do not have work outside the home, work part-time or have a little stable work, are getting married faster, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the contrary, women who have stable employment, mainly in the public sector, rest their entry into marriage and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed together. This figure goes to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to resume the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment that has been carried out has a wide influence on maternity, but less on the date of the start of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that increases the gap between the age of the marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training is, the more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who conducted elementary and higher studies were first born at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"A further distinction also exists between women, depending on their level of study.
While those who conducted elementary studies are married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have conducted high-level studies invest in this programme and give priority to achieving stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," said Mrs. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth the good
Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of Ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will take the picture of several brand products, enthralling the universal award "Because I love it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actors of the international scene, is thus joining other celebrities enrolled in the Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the last to be painted in this club were the Evangeline Lilly (Lost) actresses and Frieda Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (the Evangeline Fellow in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His biggest representatives, creators and mennequins, yesterday and today, met for the annual reimbursement of their prices, which took place in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed your meeting.
The ex-boyfriend Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chose the best manoeuvre of the year.
The port of Manuel Vincent's Aces
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente) a 30-year-old "radiographics" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
He does not do so according to predictable and learned species (biographic summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the fault of the person created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent does not leave neither the frayers nor the lights.
It is a wonderful book, which is also an exciting invitation to read and read.
I'll leave you here a few moments.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I have found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, even as I felt without number: pleasure against the fate of the Funeral, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a poetic humor that was inexhaustible, made sense, like the knife's hand that failed to kill him.
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that will last for thirty years, in the flesh in which he combines the emotion of the adult to the pleasure of the memory, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the way of loss."
On James Joyce: "Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be recorded by the northern face, on which the best alpines still stand."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
For himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a land owner of the county and sometimes that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer recalled the cry from a bridge by this Munch's character to bring his face to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he threw it into the fire of himself and calling for succession with a speech violent to the Aztecs."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneels down and prays: "Dear God, I beg you to stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were the words of Spencer: "The dream after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after life, caused the death of the wounded."
On Virginia Wolf: “In her bags she also carried her depressions.
Her husband agreed very often that she would tell him that Edouard VII was between the asses or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen such a patient and loving man of a nevrosite whose literary talent went beyond the folie."
On Pío Baroja: "What about Martín-Santos if this is to try to dissimulate Joyce at Baroja?
What's Benet trying to do if it's to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did She do if it's not to inspire this man's glory to serve him as a pedestal?"
A Little Aggression
The last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, moved to our village of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years passed by her and our dog, a bloody, saved from the SPA and not weighing more than six pounds, and without saying a word, they sent him two pairs of feet that left the severely damaged dog.
Our anger is enormous because we do not see what it takes to free up a small animal without a defense that was, in addition, left.
It is necessary to add to this the denial of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she offends these individuals, comes to fear for her physical integrity, because an animal attacker is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an elderly person or, finally, any weaker person than him.
The episode took place at 17 hours, one Tuesday as another, in a typical quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been eating all day.
We have heard a complaint from the district commission even if we are convinced that this serves to the great extent and not to affect the sensitivity, we just want to make it clear that the killer tears were Spanish.
The denial led us to deny this fact.
We don't understand what's going on in young people so they're willing to abuse a free animal that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and humans has been passed.
Michelin and Fesvial, assembled for the castle gate
The manufacturer of Michelin pneus, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the castle, mainly in the youngest motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the port of the castle, since it is the only protection element to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was included in the line with his commitment to road safety, which “go beyond the design and manufacture of more secure products” and stated that it contributed to this objective by other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the port of the case in two wheels, entitled "To be or not to be", will be a first phase during which the exhibitions will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop more secure products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles progress
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles starts to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 months of reduction, according to the figures of the parent trade union of Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers, the concessionaires.
However, the good news should be renewed, as the reference to the comparison, in November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60 per cent decrease compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the redundancy of the last month, the accumulated immaturities during these 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous period.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (tourism vehicles, pick-up vehicles, supplies, light supplies and light trucks) were sold 95,853.
Large clouds that affect their most demand are not so dissuasive; although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the costs due to external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions imposed by the limitation of bank credit, other factors such as the increase in unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic conditions need to be added.
In view of this situation and the difference in tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E has little use.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs who want to buy a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, they can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses) was again reminded.
The concessionaires' association provides for a 2010 year similar to the one achieved, for which it calculates a decrease in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19 %.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this took place with the ABS brake anti-blocking system and as it will take place with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory element on European vehicles.
They are also already mandatory on tourism vehicles and newly registered light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of absence has been fixed by February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union aims to strengthen the protection of pets, even if it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system through the foot cut given by the driver.
But this last doesn't always keep pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch vehicle manufacturer, a third of the drivers involved in an accident could not support the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take advantage of all their strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in turn, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance the vehicle needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pets could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these smart emergency braking systems: it is estimated that a four-in-a-four grid with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, using a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver from acting slightly on brakes.
If the driver reacts, he will help him by increasing pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not respond, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device will exert the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors retired until January for Opel
While the workers of the Figueruelas (Saragosse) plant were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warned that it would take more time to complete the Opel relief plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
This may mean that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers then to the Governments of the countries where the vehicles are located, will be reported until the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, in the GM, we ensure that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish Government has imposed pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also hopes to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer's application for Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, takes into account the importance.
In the case where there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese Baic company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if not sold is maintained.
From the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious beauties, Porsche engineers are part of the Boxster S and have achieved nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilos.
This led to their first transfer from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual roof to reduce 21 kilograms, to use aluminium doors such as GT3, 15 other kilograms less, to remove the air conditioning, 13 kilograms, to reduce the storage volume of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of win, to mount sports bags, 12 kilos, and with 19 pounds of light tyres, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, winning six other kilograms and replaced the bridge doors by the buttons, saving the remaining kilogram.
Although the model also exists with the PDK double buffer box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the streets of the California secondary network, in mountain, with particularly torrential screws.
Its conduct can only be defined as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the vehicle from rolling on the ground with a ball.
On the contrary, this would have been long since we had not tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, guaranteed so much safety in the wounds, including at great speed.
It's a small athlete, capable of putting his little muscle down during the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push again his engine...
That's what we want, because of its direction, as well as the communications it specifies, the car will do what our hands will show on the flight.
And she'll do it with a surgical precision.
Vol. engine sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "port" option or with a system that changes the speed of the engine, already used on Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether in the arrest or recovery.
Suspension is closed, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The reopening of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite open, but the car managed well the chicken noses.
The electronic assistants are in a bad mood to be present all over the street, while on some occasions we found the candles in the morning and the graves later in the morning.
Finally, an ultralegic car, which is the most fun to drive and which is much more than a simple change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70 831.
“ Keep on the Watch ”
An intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasionally starlight of the house's failures, the singer shows his face of a bad girl with as much content as his Chanel bag.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", it's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral received an exciting triumph at 91-82 on his visit to the green territory of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. It is thus located in the head of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic, which, with eight panels at three points, was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team has met the important absences of Herrmann, Olison, Huertas or Mikov by a large commitment and collective work dose, even if it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the large capacity since the perimeter, with 16 panes at three points marked, is widely determined by the final victory.
The match began quickly for the blue and red, which took advantage of from the beginning.
The fact that the first four panes of Vitoria's team were marked from the perimeter, he warned them that they had landed on the Israeli territory with hot poignets.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from the end of the first quarter of the 18-20th century.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose the inner game of Barak and the work of Eliahu, which was received by appeals and applause to return to his former home, to increase their benefit at the break (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to mark himself as the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although the "minimum six" of Splitter's evaluation had already warned that this night should not be the best of Brazil.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right way to the holiday, nothing was played, far away from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Victoria that we didn't get so easily on their ground, and thanks to “the hand of Elias”, they succeeded in entering the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed in a decisive way to the benefit of young people in light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from dead, had to take some action to take the air, and this is the moment when Mirza Teletovic's Mitrate, which, with three consecutive panels and the help of England and Ribas, gave the computer a fascinating score (54-67), and that the locations were able to increase to the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avala team went out to play all over the past period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) felt that they should not let anyone take what they had deserved during the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not re-sign and tried to support it from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter deleted for errors, Ivanovic's players did not anticipate, defend themselves well, and even though the Israelites were approached in the last minute (80-85), the part was already played and the victory fled to Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Pains prevent Unicaja from fighting the battle
Unicaja lost a lot in Greece to the Olympics and handed over to her the head of Euroligue Group B, at a match marked by the absence of unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been shaken by the atmosphere of the pillar of peace and friendship or by the collapse of the rival, of course one of Europe's most powerful and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter allowed to awaken the Andaluss. An aggressive defense and three panels at three consecutive points, two of Mr Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who formed the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympics were surprised by Unicaja's intensity, although the local team's arsenal with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, had been able to reverse score 22-20, at the third minute, when an action, a start of packing, between the North American masters Beverley and Williams, resulted in the disqualification of two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both camps, while the release of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal mistakes were on unicaja.
The Lithuanian inner players and Linas Kleizas, with their three-point panners, increased the 44-32 advantage, in the fifteenth minute.
A mount is impossible
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, showed a higher and even greater level of contrast between the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, with the chance of the group's head.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit from the echo of Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, through its organization, the three-point panels of Cook, and Lewis' support, left a little to hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was practically impossible because the Olympics seemed implocable when players pressed and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian pivot, Nikola Vujcic, successfully remounted the score at 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and unicaja submits, accepting the victory of the Olympics.
How much should you pay for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the pay they would earn by using their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate ads, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The "How Should You Pay?" tool calculates the user's salaries from more than 140 000 jobs available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must enter your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since a week of application, the research engine has found that in general, the Spanish worker “has been badly rewarded”, explained in a statement by Trovit’s product manager Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least paid.
A British computer programmer received EUR 45 226 gross annual and a French, 31,059, while a Spanish received EUR 24 000.
In the same way, a driver earns 34 247 euros gross annual in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Findit, the least paid job in Spain is the servant, with EUR 11,592 net per year, followed by the seller, with EUR 14,725, and the worker with EUR 15,667.
The most researched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are the driver, temporary jobs and the social worker.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in Tegucigalpa embassy.
The vice-president shall no later than 27 January 2010, on the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, responsible for Brazil's embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on Global TV that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been fled since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that from 27 January, following his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also cited the former mandater, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline was set: "My position is from the fastest possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (in the course of which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya made sure that he would remain in Brazil's embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ended, as Zelaya refused the political exclusion condition that would impose on him the government of fact, chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After a few days since the last spring, during which the inflation of assets was the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty arose again, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in an environment where the agents make decisions on a future of uncertain nature.
The reimbursement used by central banks to stabilize markets was to finance the debt by direct and indirect purchase of assets by providing liquidity at close zero rates, so that financial institutions can buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been practically finalised and, without prejudice to their non-liquidity policy, start to put some sand in the markets, as the ECB has done, with their award for a year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the global economy's ability to maintain an economic relationship without heterodox measures, and we are in favour of an investment in risk premium reduction.
The volume of profits and the gap of corporate obligations increases again, although they remain very remote from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were committed to socializing private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is a new approach to quality, and the United States, Japan and Germany have been selected by investors, leading to an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was suffering from this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor was threatened by a new revision to the downgrading of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not wrong in reducing moral risk defenders, who tried again to raise awareness of the world's economic policy leaders, who had compounded the destructive effects of the restriction of credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to describe a new day of grace.
However, the situation in Dubai is similar to a tribal struggle between the emirs to regain its position in the emires and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that exposes a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the power of roses.
It was produced in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Duráo Barroso.
It would be perfectly unreasonable for Ecofin to save Hungary from a non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a Member State in the euro area to ignore its commitments.
What is logical is that the Greek Government has been motivated by transparency and has made its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of the normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few exceptions in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as our gap in public debt increases to the extent of the obligations of European businesses, we do not have to worry about it.
If the European differences were to decline and that we were to continue to increase, it would be a risk of Spanish idiosyncrasicism.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdot. When our forecasting indicators require most of the study services to anticipate their retirement models and to review their forecasts for 2011, with more OECD and the European Commission, which return to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not raise much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment "discretion is a mother of happiness".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday in front of the Sub-Commission of the Congress of Members, where the energy strategy of Spain has been discussed these days for the next two decades.
Following his intervention, who was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán, for the press he had mentioned in front of the Sub-Commission at eight-closs.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros by 2020 and 60 000 million more between this date and 2030, in the event that today's nuclear centres are still open.
If that is not the case, the necessary investments would not be made to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
In contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Since 2020, the question will change, and the power will need to be increased.
Its pari focuses on both gas and carbon centres, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MWs are more necessary, with other "supported energy".
Galán, who believes that the draft sustainable economy Act that the government has come to approve is in the line of what his company claims, did not want to attack the Royal Decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which contradicts climate recovery policies.
According to him, there is “a long-term clear pari” in this sense, despite the "pointing" measures, as the President of Iberdrola qualified them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are long-term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Railways gain the Air Lingus maintenance market in ten airports
Swiss company Switzerland, Ferrovial branch for airport services on the ground, will play the role of the Irish Air Lingus privileged partner in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The Agreement, which did not reveal the economic terms, lasted five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to do research on the energy efficiency of cars and airports.
Akiona competes with its first car in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Akiona works for her first licensee in Australia, which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The game is an estimated $1,700 million (about €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Actiona to be established in the country as a public and concessionary company.
The mayor of the city wants to be able to make it available for the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private cooperation (PPP for its initials in English) to proceed well, within the framework of a business plan under the auspices of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be charged with singing and playing the piano.
In the wake of their next bids, the planned investment amounts to $1,700 million (about €1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortiums, with a significant presence of European builders.
The baptized group Transcity is led by Akiona, the only Spanish company in the league, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground work.
In contrast to the Akiona team, the Northern Direct Consortium is built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Lighton (the subsidiary of the German constructioner Hochtief, which has its round of the ACS participation), another local company, Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Galloise company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great singing and privatizations, but it is a great challenge if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, remains an invalid step for the Spanish genes in the sector.
The ACS is trying to acquire a place on this market by participating 30 % in Hochtief, owner of Lighton.
Millions of assets
Action is based on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a broad presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other activities, it has the largest wave park, the Waubra (102 MW) in Victoria, and leads the grouping of companies responsible for enriching and managing the desalination of Adelaide, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure markets.
The underground road, promulgated by the Office of the Infrastructures of the city of Brisbane and Ladit Northern Link (North Line), is called to link the Western road to the Peripheral Road in Kelvin Grove (see map), 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest project available to reduce traffic in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of the next year.
Despite the fact that this road will be opened at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two ways, an electronic washing system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief very fruitful, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company held by ACS will equip, through its local Leighton branch, the infrastructure of the national high-cost fibre network.
This intervention will allow 400 000 people to have fast access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has completed the construction project of the King George Tour of 27 floors in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC can contribute a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine branch, can help build a 2.1 km long tunnel for a road in Slovenia for a total of EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after being charged with the expansion work of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for a total of 130 million.
Alpine thus reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The launch of the site is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is able to help with the advertising of Renfe
Renfe entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, to the railway operator.
The contract refers to the possibility of two 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was elected from among 16 agencies presenting an offer organised by Renfe, among which four were finalists, including TBWA, who was responsible for creativity during the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
An amendment of 63 million in France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator influenced an amount of EUR 63 million in France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by consumer loyalty programmes within the framework of the regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopole and still a state enterprise, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it has placed on its competitors.
The damage suffered yesterday was also increased because the competition authority considers France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and is therefore recisive.
An application store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile telephone branch has followed the signature of other operators and opened a shop for Internet applications, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In the beginning, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has reported 476.4 million to the Real Madrid and the Barca since its creation
The League of Champions has been a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, the Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which placed them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs that earned the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is on the list.
Manchester United is on the list.
Gaining the UEFA Championships League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income from major clubs.
In fact, the competition has allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (from 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the turnout, during the 1992-1993 season, according to the UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well served in this department.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophies three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former Cup of Europe in 1992, is the fifth on the list.
In the top of the list are the Manchester United and Munich Bayern, the two teams that also made the most money for their participation in the final League of Champions.
And that, even though they've lost them in front of the Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more than one title (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This paradox appears to be explained by the complex currency allocation procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
From this sum, UFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the classification match (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received only 3.8 million to be there, plus EUR 550 00 for each match.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (EUR 800 000) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth quarter are three million each, eight who arrive in the fourth quarter receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, as part of fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million and at least 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça has won the Super Cup in August for 2.5 million.
In addition, there are variable payments, which are devoted to 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the relative value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and it has four attractive places.
The previous year's campaign amounts to 40% of the money affected, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid in accordance with the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
New Rumasa offers EUR 61 million for 29,9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group described yesterday the details of the purchase of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 per cent of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not require him to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for the total title.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per operation, which will be spent in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this report.
Yesterday, Sos’ actions ended at EUR 1,85; New Rumasa’s offer therefore assessed the company’s 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is provided by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The group of Jerez provides a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although the company of Ruiz Mateas has claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were located, the decline would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos' capital would be 254.27 million.
In the meantime, His continues the restructuring of his leadership.
In an attempt to stay out of the possibility of buying and selling and becoming judges of his former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the choice of María Luis Jordá as an internal audit director.
A decision by the first woman to take a lead position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the Chairman of the Group.
And it is not an exception to polygamy, because the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged deterioration of more than 230 million of Its to Salazar companies.
In addition, the possibility of new fund transfers can not be separated in the coming months.
As for the Salazar credit, former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday in front of the National Audition that they had been informed of the destruction of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorises the OPA exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the OPA exclusion presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October last.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the existing standards and that it would consider the content of the explanatory sheet submitted as amended on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer relates to the acquisition of 550,008 shares by Federico Paterinina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, representing 8,95% of the social capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592 778 million shares were reallocated and that they could not be transferred in any way before the end of the tender, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paterinina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New vehicle expertise tools
In these days of bad times and accidents, car garages are not the only ones that win.
Each day, thousands of cars that have climbed a ladder are reduced to a garage, where an expert needs to assess the costs and the cost of repair.
Each sinister is different, and the calculation of the cost of the parts and the working time can be a long and complex work.
To calculate the cost of an adjustment of EUR 20 000 to EUR 30 000, including parts and tools, may take two or three hours.
On the contrary, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The service providers and solutions for the evaluation of sinisters and maintenance are involved in collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing them and providing them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex, of the North American Group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the field of evaluation tools and information development on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Managing Director of Audatex, the company in Spain has 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed does not cease to increase, although over the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than over the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies are on their way to work.
This is a very expensive job, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be cataloged and their price entered.
In addition, there is a graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourism car.
If this is a massive sales model, the work can be prepared in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If this is a small car sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audadex has full information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 %.
To carry out the work on documentation and the development of databases, Audadex has eight centres across the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each is specialized in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There, more than a hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three screens of computers.
Audadex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to provide different uses and to propose different products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of spare parts or to calculate the van or residential value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of car rental in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not propose it in our country, but it does it to the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audadex, it is easy to make an idea of the type of support it can offer to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the fair product is AudaPlus, the standard solution for the evaluation of sinisters for experts.
Y consists of cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes account of repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it at least 10 times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it comes from the assembly chain, only through its number of chassis.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an open server in the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to search for vehicles that have been declared spam.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geo-demographic analyses, or to know the problems that arise by brand or model.
It is possible, for example, to study how many models of a particular brand are taken to the garage for a panel or how they have suffered from severe leftovers for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company devoted to the development of this type of tool.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a enterprise of the Innsa group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions to assess the grids, panels or maintenance.
The GT evaluation guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume increased by 20 per cent per year over the past three years, and it accounted for €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she launched her process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
On the other hand, Audadex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.

Car Hires on the Internet
In October last month, the Solera group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The operation involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could extend the next year to 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more valuable services added to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a vast international market.
This service of assessment and sales is exclusively addressed to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cashiers and professional sellers who must be registered before the start of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and operates more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
More than 1500 sellers and 4000 experts are currently available on the website.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to the Spanish law, a vehicle with the number of chassis is no longer able to circle, but instead, some parts that are not covered can be used as replacement parts.
The collection cars can be reregistered, although they have been withdrawn after complex departures.
Four-step garages
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audadex company ensures that the user obtains a fee in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search the replacement room, create a device and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals that, in a greater or lesser degree, they are resistant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 of tourism, 109 of all land, 137 engines, 78 vehicles and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer and Internet connection are needed to use it.
Once the model to repair identified by its chassis number, a real graphic picture of the model in question appears then select the required piece.
The user may include variables such as the labour price, increases or reductions, and may print the loan to send it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include the estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be made of a credit.
Currently, Audadex works for these images to be three dimensions.
This is an innovation that the mechanics see from a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
