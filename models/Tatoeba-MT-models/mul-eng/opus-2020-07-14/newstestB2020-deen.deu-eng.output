Fired in French Chemistry
The Great Fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen was removed. It shared the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire was fired at night on Thursday. No one was hurt when it happened. The fire was used with about 200 explosives.
The contents of the fire could be given
The buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and childcares were closed on Thursday. In the chemical workshop at its site, additional raw materials are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which provides for strict safety ceilings.
In the work, about 400 people are working. The Chemistry factory was already in the process of cutting lines - i.e., as of 2013 through a lake, the gas methanthiol is developed and the environment is growing rapidly after fall. In 2015 it flows into the city’s water system after a fall of about 2,000 litres of mineral oil.
The woman announces her job to look for 57 days after her missing dog
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her lost dog - and announced her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had been away from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days from the Hündin every trace was missing - but Carole King was not up.
"It was scary. I got used to it," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went to the evening. When they went back to the hotel, Katie was gone.
Donner had a dog in panic.
In the hope that Katie could stay anywhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "It's about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King remembers with "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately disappeared.
With flying and calling on Facebook groups, the kings were looking for their favorite dog. But for days I never gave up. "I have never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced their job as postmans to continue their search for Katie.
"Flow the trains"
57 days after Kates disappeared, Carole King made a call: a man reported and said that Katie was in his court. However, as the king came there, Katie was already missing. She looked for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her nest under a tree. "I just wanted to let them go," the king said, "The trains were flying. The people kept in their cars, rising from us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them."
Lost in the Federal War: Machines are lost free of charge
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machine opponents of the MG3 type are still missing.
In the past years, the Federal War has lost a number of weapons and tens of thousands of shields ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The remaining remains are unclear in most cases. The opposition is said to be of a "responsive" size.
In the case of the Federal War, weapons and ammunition are always disappearing again - many of them have been unspoiled. Since early 2014, the troops have been hiding the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts and almost 20,000 pieces of ammunition. This is the first list of the Federal Defence Ministry, which reports on the German editing network.
According to the paper from the Office of Defence Secretary Peter Tuber of the CDU, two weapons, one gun and 3474 shot ammunition have been reassessed. In addition, there are six types of MG3, eleven weapons of type G3, four weapons of type G36, six signal guns and two guns of type P8. In addition, 30 guns are missing for machine guns of type MG3.
The amount of weapons and ammunition losses in the Federal Sea is "relative", said the Linken-Function Officer Martina Renner. This is also true, since in the course of investigations there has never been anything more. The left-wing politician spoke of a "required balance". Renner criticized that the list did not show that there were also those who were found on the list in connection with investigations against the under-terrorist federal prosecutor Franco A. "And although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after his arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas today on Friday. As ship observation data showed refinitively, the tanker was moved and lost the Iranian port. As the target port of Port Rashid was given in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first he remained in Iranian waters. From the voyage it was said that an official order was expected from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was brought up on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Hormuz Sestraße, in order to ignore security provisions. However, it was suspected that Iran had responded to the ongoing, prolonged arrest of an Iranian oil tanker before the British-owned Gibraltar.
The road of Hormuz is one of the world's most important seestrates. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is being moved by the sea. The tensions in the region have been intense over the past months. The trade ship was involved in the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Markel deserves the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has praised the commitment of the people in the DDR, who were on the streets 30 years ago during the peaceful revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had brought the immediate DDR regime into the courts, Merkel said at a festival of the Thuringer CDU Group for the first day of the German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the establishment of the Stasi Central. "The state security was taken away," she said.
Mouse is active for release records
Teslas Quartal may have a record ready. Despite the delivery tree, there was the last loss of the electric car group.
New York.Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company with a view to new records. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliverys", Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published in a branch blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong so that Tesla 110,000 orders could be booked, it continued to be written in Moscow. The challenge was to bring the cars to the company as soon as possible. In order to do so, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible.
In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95000 cars with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. So strong the course has not been available for nearly four months.
Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals. 2019 wants to deliver all 360000 to 400,000 cars. In order to do this, in running and coming quarter years, six-digit numbers are needed. In particular, the most valuable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few gains. Despite the tree, there have been last losses.
Tips Solved: That's why we can't kill ourselves
A kind of Bremse in the Grand Hire prevents people from being able to kill themselves. This has been found by scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Donnerstagend. Progress has also been made on the question why children have been so strong against the whales, just to ask for more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the neighbor of a kitten's hand has already been released before the attack. This is at a deep edge in the big brain, which has already released the lake when waiting for the kitzel.
The previous research showed that rats with "Lachen" in the ultrasonic area react when they are bitten by humans. This "Lake" will be transmitted through the large-scale breast cancer, which will serve as the central processing of the haptic perception.
Lachen is underpressed during self-transmission
Until then, it has been concluded that the brain may differ between self-transaction and contact by others - that is why people can't make their own whales. However, in the experiments on the Councils, Berlin researchers found that the lake is underpressed as well as the activity of the area of the Great Hierarchy during a self-referencing. This is also true when life itself takes place. During the spring and the harvest by scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse have been strengthened.
But pass the self-help and the contact by others at the same time, if the lake is also depressed. This indicated that the brain of the Council could not distinguish itself from the self-reproaching and contact by others. The new findings showed that people can't isolate themselves, because self-transaction activates a brake in the brain.
The rats have also been trained to kill themselves. This initiative in the experiment is sometimes accompanied by pre-emptive behaviour, behaviour of flight or shock star. This ambivalentity is similar to the behavior of children. The ambivalentness of the kitel is a behavior reaction similar to that of rats and humans.
Catastrophe rejected: Great Fire in French Chemistry
The Great Fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen was removed. It shared the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was fired on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no health-threatening substances should be issued. The samples taken give no reason to be encouraged, as Professor Pierre-Andre-Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The firefight was used with about 200 vans.
Schools and childcare has been closed
Residents were invited not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and childcares remained closed on Thursday.
Fabrik belongs to Lubrizol from US-Millian Warren Buffett
In the chemical plant at the site of Hisine, additional substances are produced for foams. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US-Millardar Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety flags.
The chemical factory has already provided for cutting lines in the past – like, as of 2013, the gas methanthiol is mixed with a bed and the environment is rapidly falling after fall of eggs. In 2015 it flows into the city’s water system after a fall of about 2000 litres of mineral oil.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The Premier's sister commented at the first sitting in Parliament after the suspension of the forced break at midnight. The Premier sought to drive the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement, and Brussels should not rely on its demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement. However, as he wishes to achieve it, it is unclear.
Regarding Cox, which was used for the rest of the UK in the European Union, the Premier said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's ideas and to re-establish this country would be to complete the EU Austria." Cox was killed in 2016 during the referendum campaign by a legal extremist.
Moment to join Oslo and Utöya will be filled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths on Saturday in Norway, the monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) is composed of about 1,000 isolated rosen images. They remember the roses of thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be completed - the roses were surrounded by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims.
On 22 July 2011, the justiceist Anders Behring Breivik had launched an automobile bomb in the government district of Oslo and was shot at the island of Utöya Dutzende by a holiday host of the youth organization of the social democratic working party. In total, 77 people were killed.
Iran is free of British tanks
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to Iran's conflict, but now there is a less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" in Iran could come back into the sea. It could be a puzzle in the Iranian President's peace plan Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has been established since mid-July in the streets of Hormus in Iran. After release from Iran's authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as told by the voyages of Steina Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the Crew now runs among other medical studies to Dubai, explained Dr. Erik Hånell. On Wednesday the ship has left the Iranian waters. "It's too late," he said to the Swedish TV transmitter SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the establishment of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere with the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," he said on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker on July 19th under the pretext that the sea law in the Persian Gulf had violated. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members went well, Hånell said. They would have been professionally treated in view of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks. The travelers are now working to regroup with their families as soon as possible.
The British government, following the establishment of the Stena Impero, encouraged a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: At the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was destined for Syria, was placed on the chain.
The Iranian spoke of "piratery" and expressed the consequences. In mid-August the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. It must have been done to get rid of the "Stena Impero" as London came back.
The road of Hormus is one of the world's most important seestrates. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world's oil exports are being moved by the sea. The tensions in the region have been intense over the past months. The trade ship was involved in the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Following the tensions between Tehran and Washington, both countries are at the forefront of the nuclear conflict. Americans seek to build Iran's leadership. Iran shows that it is back. The United States, in 2018 alone, was exempt from the International Atomic Agreement, which would prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has set the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to establish a more stricter and further agreements in other areas.
Because of the strike around the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for safety and peace on the road of Hormus at the UN vol. in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection for the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
In the case of its protectionist economic policy, it is a better future.
In view of the fact that the U.S. President Donald Trump's criminal acts against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reassess themselves. The financial heads of Asian companies who consider their production from China in another country call India a question of the U.S. as one of the preferred alternatives. This is not only to do with the inequities of the Chinese-American trade war. With a Russian-based labour force and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be created to play an important role in the global chain of production.
But now India itself has been created in Trump's Focus. The White House has been regarded as the "Kingdom of the Clouds" by the Hautegen, in the beginning of June, by the United States of America for 2000 products. The United States has visited India prohibitively high Oils and requires better market access to agricultural ducts, mobile phones, Spirits, motor wheels and more.
On the world map of the World Trade War, the regimes with India are free of charge. In addition, the Americas consider the world's largest democracy also through the security policy blight. Delhi and Washington are linked to the concerns about China's claims of power in the Southern Ocean. In the background, an American criminal suit against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has also been in office for a second five-year period, may therefore be safe.
The problem lies elsewhere: The empiricized theses that open markets speed up economic development in the socialist Republic of India has a difficult situation. Its reformer aims primarily to the bureaucratic Ireland, which has been exposed to all kinds of business spirit in the state of many countries. Companies now receive rapid births for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a stronger insolvency and competition law creates conditions for companies with a seemingly high debt to liquidate.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the appropriate rankings. From an economic perspective, it has been widely used in India in the first five fashion years, but in trade policy it is not appropriate to do so. In order to protect internationally less competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the National Conservative Government has even created new problems.
In the West, the fashion of the energy reformer depends on its country’s economic renewal. This impression is not due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister only knows what Vocabular Western Managers like. In the core, the Indian First Advocate never turned away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to execute anachronistic processes and thus fit into global competition. Business people who survive the closure of their industries are among the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's tribes and spread this short-term policy.
Application by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac will be presenting a report next week in Paris. The former Head of State will be appointed on Monday at the Peace Court Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported on the Chiracs family. The order will take place in a family circle. On Sunday, a public mourning party in Paris was announced as media reported.
The competitor was targeted: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Leichtateletik-WM
The world’s peak was already in the goal of playing in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. During the first time, Jonathan Busby found it dangerous to move over 5000 meters from Aruba. He was almost 300 metres ahead of the target, he was in a rather unsightly position, as Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly stopped him and supported him by the last half of the stadium rounds in the target. The forces were still going to stop the ongoing battle. As long as the scenes were not enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the run in the Mixed Zone, when he was totally unexpected the attention of the gathered journalists on his own. He was afraid that he would never talk about his hero. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and if he had noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one sufferer. And although he was proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Alliance. In normal circumstances, he could not even start. "That is why I am proud to be here for my country," he said.
This he did on the evening with neural pressure - and much more intense than he might have thought it. Because this heroate will be remembered. By the time Dabo's competitors had even taken the lead in the target and voluntarily took over the last place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega who won this race. It had not been used at the end of all, because the busby who had come to the target with a lot of help was disqualified just because of the end of the world's satellite connection.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, was present to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. This was due to official data, although at 18:10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I've been back in 18 minutes." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions of men: Egypt cries for wild protest days
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the event of possible government-critical protests. At Cairo's centre on Friday, there was an increased police presence. Several U train stations remained closed, roads were closed around the central Tahrir Square.
In recent days, the police have strengthened their road controls, and the telephones of foot soldiers have been partially searched for messages and photos in relation to the Protestants.
Against Al-Sisi
Last week it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critical corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against political leadership had not been given in Egypt for years. The Egyptian builders and actors in the Spanish exile, Mohammed Ali, who had brought the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, were calling for a "Million March" in central places in the country. Ali asks for a "Volks revolution". The man is for most of the young Egyptians, however, not even for the "stupider, but for the poor."
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase by two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1.570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests.
Voluntary adoptions
Many people would have been "fashioned" "only because they were 'in the wrong time at the wrong place'", HRW shared with legal prisoners. The claims against the prisoners were made according to their allegations of "dispersion of false information" to membership in a "terrorist union". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, they questioned and searched for security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW data.
HRW also criticised the Zensur in the North African country. The government in Cairo websites and online services are blocking further protests against Sisi.
Online dealer: Dealers should be able to easily pay returns
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost. About 20 million returns are on the ground. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers, such as Amazon and Zalando, how they can spend returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the company could not be exempted from the sales tax on cash, the Ministry explained on a question of the Green Bundestag Group which reported on the news of the Funke Media Group on Friday. However, the dealers could consider the market value of the non-commercial returns so low that they did not have to pay any or only little sales taxes.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens were sending back each of the six packages on orders on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - countries respectively in Müll. They would be able to spend the company's additional money after current legal cases, as the financial authorities assess the cash flows as a turnover, which will then be taxed.
Green Group Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt asked Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies could not assess sales products properly and can spend free of charge on non-profit organisations. The companies had to be able not to be punished for their expenses. This applies not only for the online handle, but also for other sales from the modelling to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There has never been a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart Star Banksy, "Developed Parliament", should be extended first.
Banksy's work is underpinned by "the restoration of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy to the basic content of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the image of Sotheby's in the UK capital will be displayed until it is expanded on October 3, which will be estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first published in the Museum of Bristol in the West British, where Banksy lives. In this year the artist had re-examined the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work that was previously called "Frequent hour", called "Devolved Parliament" ("Deleged Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million.
Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard exchange of objections at the first meeting of the House following the suspension of a forced break by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wanted to complete the two already moved Brexit on 31 October without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, joined the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south of England, he painted a picture that depicts a man carrying a star of the European flag.
Brexit debate is like a space walk in the park
The violent attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit Winners in Parliament do not lead to a climate of the Hasses. Compared to the campaign against the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy is a "passing in the park", Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy it. We will get out (from the EU) and we will win".
In the past few days, Johnson had been heartbroken in Parliament and accused of the people, among other things, of "prosperity" and charges that he could endanger the members of the House because they could be the target of murder, he turned out to be "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore peace would be if the MEPs would finally respect the British decision for an outsider from the EU, and it is not surprising that the people were surprised at the fact that Britain had not yet been expelled from the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the vote taken on Friday, even the bishops of the Church of England called for adjournment. "We should speak respectfully with each other," said it in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan demands Uno-Engreichen in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmiri conflict at its first meeting before the UN.
Otherwise, if there is another war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India, Khan probably said on Friday at the UN-General debate in New York. "If it goes bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You have to stop it."
In Germany and Pakistan, since their independence from the British colonial government in 1947, two wars have taken place around the divided region of Kashmir. Both atoms dominate part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, India in the Indian Kashmir region had lifted its autonomy and thus increased its tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Never a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the storm of the Egyptian president al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a strong hand. With a sharp munitions on the population, over 2000 prisoners are confined to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prison. Protests were never dangerous in Egypt. However, since the arrest of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the government has done everything to prevent a scenario like during the Arab spring.
However, one of the solution to the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspective and the feeling that the government itself is going through is driving millions to the street. And this is a problem that the regime of El-Sisi does not get into the grip of, no matter how hard it is to deal with, the situation has even deteriorated.
Since 2016 the currency has lost more than half of its value, the rate of inflation is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who has funded: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military is building streets, houses, football stadiums, producing food and many more. This has already been so. With authority, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the Supermarket. Critically it will always be when a large part of education is needed.
Tuv tests in the terminal: BER-Chief: No showstopper for main city airport
Two months have been checked whether the complex installation body works at the BER brand protection in the joint game. The operators are satisfied with the operation. However, the tyre is still not finished at the BER.
After major audits in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October the following year. This is certain, according to the Board of Supervisors Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
Airport chief Engelbert Lücke Daldrup spoke out of a successful investigation, but he also said that it was still a mistake to work out in the terminal. "We have many details, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until the start of operation still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve should no longer be too large. The construction indicator should now be introduced during the first quarter of 2020 at the construction site, which was foreseen at the beginning of the year.
"To create the conditions for the acquisition of the flight operation, the train must continue to work intensively on the processing of the tires," said a written communication.
Lücke Daldrup said, in many cases, it goes about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is still no release for all the doodles on which the cable tracks depend. The airport chief expects it to be available for years.
In addition, fire protection is not yet satisfactory when it passes to the train station under the terminal. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking slamming out at a fire like a liin wall so that the smoke does not spread. They are going too far. 36 engines must therefore be excavated. Then there will be a new attempt at the start of the year with heat gas.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects and planning errors have slowed the opening of the airport for years. Initially, it should go into operation in 2011. The costs have risen from two billion to about EUR 6.5 billion in the next year since the beginning of 2006.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin are either significantly increased, the officials plan to build the airport, so it should go to a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by the President Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new business leaders. Finance Heike Fölster is changing at the end of the year to the German Bahn, staff chief Manfred Bobke from Cam next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Automated for Drugs - Police take a man
He needed money for drugs - and was hunting for several cars in Chemnitzer City area in the air! Now the manufacturer is finally in port!
In the past two years, the number of broke cigarette and parking cars in Chemnitz and the region has been strongly alarmed.
After two detonations, the police set up a 33-year-old German in Chemnitz on the city street and on the Fourth Street.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation of the conduct of explosive explosions in tateny with a particularly severe case of theft led by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33-years."
Compared with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer was now in total eight.
The police speaker: "With the beute he has publicly financed his perpetuity". Only four times the bomb broke down on the city street by car between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage is at least 60 000 euros!
The automatic bomber is now in the investigation department. The police investigation continues against him.
It is thought that he was also responsible for further automatic explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent country crises.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Airhansa Group is strengthening its strategy for the Vienna airport. During the prize struggle with air carriers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the AAUA's daughter "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" confirmed an Austrian airline speaker against the APA on Friday. She had previously reported "AviationNetOnline".
The Vienna base of the Eurowings Airport will thus be resolved. From the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This takes up the AUA from January 2020 to include Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings Jets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as chartering machines. The departures from Vienna to Germany will be taken by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA Drive Cross and the Network Planning, the speakers explained. The flight times should be agreed on connection flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna Railway Cross and to develop the decentral transport from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serve as "Production Company" for the AUA Group Sisters. This would include Barcelona and Rome with the AUA flight number, but mainly with the Eurowings device. The board product should be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but pilots and air carriers from Eurowings. Eurowings starting under the AUA flight number will no longer be reported in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki-Plette, a pre-ship was launched. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would be set up for the next 16 aircraft. The Irish ticketer sends four Ryanair machines and Crews to Vienna, as well as the so-called "Wetlease", which criticised the cooperation as the context for the collective agreement.
The Battle case by Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda has been overcome by the AUA for five years was awarded on Friday, the AUA president Andreas Otto: "We remain the number one in place in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is allowed
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four are married. Beatrice is allowed!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian fairs in the beginning of the month, Eduardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was supposed to have held the hand of his friend Princesin Beatrice (31). This was known to the palace on Thursday.
"We are very happy to be able to announce our departure. We are both very happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect it to be actually married," said the couple who have been in the United Kingdom media since October 2018 in the official communication.
And further, "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the coming years, it will be very helpful in love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the images
The official permission photos have been published on her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also on her Instagram account.
A Royal Festival
The holiday will take place in 2020. More information on date, location and everything else will be known in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the count of the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a similar big party like the defeat of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, malnutrition - there are risk factors for heart disease. But what really solves a heart failure or infection? Hamburger researchers now want to see the benefit of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Over the analysis of the legacy of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to see the causes of heart disease more detailed.
The research project is the largest of this type in the German-language area, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) shared with the project on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with EUR 12.5 million. From Switzerland, the University of Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, is involved in the University Hospital Zurich.
Overweight, smoking and malnutrition are among the significant risk factors for heart disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. But the combination between genes and external influences is not known enough. Now scientists want to compare the full benefit of 8,000 healthy people with the 1,000 patients of the UCE University heart and liver centre.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes have been known to develop potential disease-producing changes in the DNA - so-called mutations - from the clinic. Each year there are about 200.
The goal of the five-year project is to develop new options for the care, recognition and treatment of heart disease, heart failure and heart problems. The data could also be useful in researching other people's diseases, such as Stefan Blancenberg, head of the University of Heart and Feet Centre. New knowledge of heart, heart and kidneys, as well as cancer.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed the firm's desire to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Foundation's clinic in Davos is currently dealing with allergies. Now a center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine will be created and a professor for bioinformatics will be created. In view of his commitment, the Swiss-based logistics operator said that he had been operating in Hamburg three years ago in open hearts and very grateful.
The biotests of healthy participants came from Hamburgers, who also participated in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 samples, according to the clinic, the world's largest local health study will be the largest. When the abortion is closed, scientists will take seriously the protection of anonymous data. It goes to Petabyte (1,000 terabytes) to data, Holger Moch from Zurich University Hospital.
A person's income can be resolved today according to UKE within 24 hours. The net costs are at EUR 1300. The first gene sequence in the world whose results have been published in 2001 has still cost hundreds of millions of euros. The study will start on 1 October, and all 9000 samples will be analysed by the end of 2020. The first results will be expected in the year.
Nigerian Police Free Hundreds of Untreated Boys · Global Voices
In Nigeria, the police released more than 300 injured and abused boys from a Corran school. According to local security forces, the school in the Nordic city of Kaduna was searched for and discovered the victims, as Yakubu Sabo had reported. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them were allowed to be raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys would have been held in advance, taught in the Koran and "improved". In fact, their teachers would have been detained under "the most disturbing and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children under the age of nine, were in a small room.
The Corran school had been following the data for about ten years. The authorities had noticed repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had been shocked when they had been informed about the status of the Corran school, said Sabo. They had not been hurt by the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested by the police.
In the vast Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private schools. They are often replaced by missing state institutions. People in the region are suffering from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee relief work, therefore, in the last ten months more than 40,000 people over the border in the neighbouring state of Niger are flying.
Accused and persecuted: Nigeria Police release 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have released nearly 400 students from sexual relations. "Many of them had been recorded and some of them had visible injuries that appeared on the floor," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children were discovered on Thursday after an instruction in an Islamic school. The terms there were "humanly". The officers took the school leaders and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all young people, were held in their school as slaves and placed in chains. Some were sexually abused. TV shows showed disabled and injured students in a condition that was recognized as bad.
World football choice: Other preferences by Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Not Valid Signature"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe are excellent
With a Gala in Milan, the world football band Fifa draws the best players, the best players and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth prize and that record.
After Nicaraguas said that he had never voted in the World Cup election, he was asked to join the Fifa. Egypt was not even assessed - with a strong reason.
In the past years, many of the Fifas have proved to be a threat: the WM donations, the double plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. The Fifa World Baller elections have not yet led to the suspicion of leaving – if it is considered that the member's most qualified national trainers and national partners often vote after sympathy.
However, after Nicaraguas had already regretted that he had not voted in favour of the vote, other objections now occurred: Egypt complained that the votes of national trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they did not appear in the official and public view of the vote.
The Fifa argues that "the signatures of the electors were issued in large letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian connection has been contacted several times in order to clarify the situation - without response.
Sudan's Trainer is also amazed
There is also a rise in the Sudan's choice. While the case is complete in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese association suggests that the trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not agree as it was finally assessed: with Lionel Messi on one place, Virgil van Dijk on two and Saudi Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote was just as final, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese League.
He also said: "Have not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the statements to my voice are false, thank you," he wrote. In his case it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football band simply voted in his name.
On Friday, the message came: vote, but of course it was not a wish. The filled volunteer documents were "recordedly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan election, who had seen it in a communication. However, he had chosen the second Captain Manuel Rosas. "We took responsibility for the administrative errors", he said in the communication. Both Rosas and the husbandly sister Henry Durtte had voted for Messi, "but as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases can now be examined by the Fifa in an investigation, but stresses that the election process was watched outside by the consultancy company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the only unwarranted winner of the World Football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine Affairs: Rankhohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have spoken out for an official investigation against US presidents and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the U.S. Federal State Vermont, Phil Scott. "What is done here is determined by the facts that will be determined." He wants to know more about the Whistlelower cases before taking action. An impasse procedure can lead to the president's resignation.
Scott said he was not surprised by the enthusiasts. He had shown that Trump had repeatedly called upon Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic president and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have continued to resort to trup with criticism because of the whistleblower charges, but few have been able to recognize them. Scott's remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already been involved in anti-trump policy, such as the closure of environmental protection laws and the cancellation of immigration laws.
Another ranked Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a very disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right way and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and go on the basis of it."
Scott and Baker as governor of the US federal states have formally not spoken in the proceedings against Trump, which will be discussed at the Congress. Therefore, their statements are particularly symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republican are also critically concerned about the situation. With Romney, who is the head of the federal state of Utah in the second House of Parliament, said that the case would be "extremely devastating and utterly devastating". U.S. media also report that they are in the first place in the Republican.
In the introduction of an official anti-trump procedure, the democracies in the representative's house could have announced an investigation, and they would provide him with the use of power for foreign influence for their own political benefits.
With the majority of the representatives of the House of Representatives, the Democrats could seek a so-called commitment. The decision on an actual appointment was made in the Senate where the majority of Republicans had a majority.
Were the folders on the board of rockets "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been found in Sicily, they are supposed to have raped and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she was arrested by the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board without permission from the port of Lampedusa. Following strong protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was resumed after a few days by an Italian judge.
There are now new severe threats against rockets. There may be three men who have been subjected to torture in Libyan refugee camps, with the "Sea Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been found in a receptionist in Messina (Sysilia) after migrants have recognizable their pain in Italy. "We can't hide it, but we don't even have certain information about it," said the "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben Newman of the German Press Agency.
It was reported by the police in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, arrested and even killed. It was handled by Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and both Egypter Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically sneezed and subjected to brutal attacks - through repeated and persistent physical violence," he said.
NGOs and relief organizations now point out that they can't know exactly who's coming to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They're coming without the passports," said Newman. Then be one of the main reasons why people fly from Libya. So it's probably that they're also doing on ships. "That's why it's very important that it's going to happen".
Mr Matteo Salvini, Italian Justice Minister for Foreign Affairs, asked for a pardon from Rakete, who is still being found in Italy because of aid for illegal immigration.
Musculates delivery records at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company with a view to new records on the bridge.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published in a branch blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong so that Tesla 110,000 orders could be booked, it continued to be written in Moscow. The challenge was to bring the cars to the company as soon as possible. In order to do so, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible.
In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95,000 cars with a plus of more than six per cent of the trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. 2019 wants to deliver all 360,000 to 400,000 cars. In order to do this, in running and coming quarter years, six-digit numbers are needed. In particular, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few gains. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
US Budget Strategy: Renews only a bridge financing
The new budget year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a regular budget. The Senate will be followed by the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided to finance the transition until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the expenditure ceilings for the financial year 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again free of spending. The Senate is on Thursday following the representative's house and has decided to finance the transition (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a summit on Monday, a joint meeting of the federal administration.
Shutdown aborted
The Federal Government will now be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 at the end of the Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to rely on the 12 rules of expenditure which can be allocated to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit from the additional expenditure framework for the new financial year of 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion.
The Democrats have produced ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have produced the majority, but the laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans.
The spirits are divided primarily on the issue of resource allocation for the field of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of the great priorities of President Trump. Democrats are breaking down the wall construction plans and the financing that is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The battle over the wall construction was already scheduled in December 2018 and led to a 35-day Shutdown.
At the Wall Building the Spirits Distinct
It is now unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. Probably more than an agreement on all twelve issues in the coming seven weeks, it is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also a Shutdown is not yet excluded.
In view of the continuing inability of the Congress to adapt to the twelve rules of expenditure, and therefore the imminent risk of a Shutdown to the process of automation to popularity. Proposal S. 1877 on the prevention of Shuttdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the previous year's level, to involve Parliamentary travel activities and to repay their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are submitted.
France permits artificial fertility for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertility should also be opened in the future for single women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly agreed with a great majority for a government legislative proposal that all women can apply for in-vitro consumption, so that demand for anonymous compounds should be made clear.
The proposal still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right place warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow. The French Bishop's Conference is also opposed to the renewal.
The new arrangement is the core component of a bioethics gesture, which Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn described as "cance" for society. It represents the modern family in which it has children with only one parent or gay parents. The cost of artificial fertility for all women should be borne by the social insurance.
Fertility with sperm from dead husband further prohibits
With a rather modest majority, the National Assembly showed back an amendment that the whites should give for an artificial fertility access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertility "post-mortem" was allowed. In Germany, in the past, there were cases in which women complained about the release of the sperm of a deceased person. The opposition of the president in Paris argued that such a common child would carry a "specially heavy shell".
On the contrary, several members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and of the opposition's members had spoken out for the artistic performance with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a white person will be released a "double trauma" if her husband's death still makes her childish.
The sponsors of the proposed amendment are wrong to say that a witness can be born with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with their own partner.
To date, the artificial fertility in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot testify to children. They must be married or have been married for at least two years. Busin had already announced in the summer that the maternity continues to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertility is open to all women theoretically - for singles or lesbian couples, it is often difficult.
Climate balance: Calling after flight fee for the Union will be charged
There are many refugees at colleges. Therefore, the country will also be allowed to contribute to climate change in the future. The Rectors say they had no money for it, but they are now also under pressure.
The schools should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street
The debate on a climate response to flights from universities and universities again came to a close. After the country-sector conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding precedent from the Green Black Coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctors of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical college for compensation of services, which, as the first step, had to be given a broad debate on the prevention of flights, it was in their opinion that the plans were now under way.
Russia re-takes North Korean fishing
The FSB's secret service should have been illegal in Russian waters. Ten days ago 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. At that time, there was a shift between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Koreans were injured, the fishermen later suffered their severe injuries. But this time, there were no injuries, there was no damage.
The Communists of North Korea are under chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore in the Russian waters of sovereignty, where the coastal village of Russia is following its own data to protect their marine resources patrols.
30 000 tinted fish
At the latest, 30,000 tint fish were discovered and caught on the boats. In addition, the data were collected after three fishing boats and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's Fisheries Authority also did not issue a prison licence to the North Koreans this year, according to domestic entrepreneurs' complaints. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been recently established in this year.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the shipping region Primorje, Georgia Martynow, recently also blamed high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with the highly-managed synthetic networks prohibited in Russia. These would also have taken small habitats from the sea. In addition, the networks would simply be taken into the sea, where they spent 200 years to be replaced.
In the future only 18,000: USA reduces asylum mountain ranges from
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is threatened by those who seek protection: As the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal upbringing of refugees will be reduced further. In the future, there will be a threat to believers and Iraqi asylum.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the historically low threshold for the recruitment of new refugees. In the economic year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, the maximum of 18,000 people will be left in the country, as the US Foreign Ministry stated. In the recent economic year, the limit is still around 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has severely reduced the recruitment readiness for asylum seekers from all over the world in recent years.
The range of 18,000 refugees has been the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, called it "the largest and most powerful nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the use of the official US President's language.
A "responsibility conscious approach" with refugees aims to enable refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he has many demands, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of departure is the border to Mexico, which is about to collapse. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump has linked national emergency. Whether there is a temporary relationship between the current measure and the current internal political developments in the US capital, it is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj operations and perhaps a disturbing official assignment procedure.
The US Government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future after a statement from the Foreign Office is made by the US Government: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are at risk, as described in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The United States wants to ensure that people in particular from this "needy triangle" Central America are applied to other countries in asylum. Prior to this background, the United States has concluded with Guatemala and with El Salvador and Honduras with a migration agreement in order to reduce the migration to the southern United States to Mexico.
Court ordered release from Orange-Utan from Zoo
A Orange-Outan-Webbchen was transferred from the former Argentina Justice Zoo of Buenos Aires to a human attack station in the United States. The 1986 "Sandra" born in Rostocker Zoo was spoken to the rights of a "non-human" person, so their release was forced. The animal was brought on its way to Dallas by direct flight, but not as a passenger, but in the interview, as Professor Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of hard human oil are not able to adapt to life in the wild, they will live in the future at the center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other oranges and 31 chimpanzees, including "Bubbles", originally owned by Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before arriving in Florida, "Sandra" has to run a 40-day quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent some years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of protecting animals has contributed to the transformation of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark. By 2023, there is a research and education centre for the acquisition of species.
Record for Switzerland Extremberg Stairs: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Dani Arnold extreme mountain range is located almost 3,000 metres high in the Italian Alps.
Without net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss forced the 550 metres high north of the Great Wall into a new record time.
Dressed with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported by absolute speed freedom, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise, thus subsidizing the old best brand for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European northern ports.
Nicke benefited from a new online marketing strategy
The US sports item manufacturer Nicke, despite the trade conflict with China, has bought a significant profit plus. The net profit increased in the current quarter to 1.4 billion dollars (up to 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 per cent more than in the previous year's period, as the company reported on the service day. This is why the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct" is mainly used online by the Adidas competitor to its customers.
The sales increased by 10.7 billion dollars by the end of August, until the end of August. The most powerful were the Nicke sales figures with a plus 22 percent in China. As a result, Beaverton companies in the U.S. federal state of Oregon also benefited from its use in the People's Republic of China to direct consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial Director Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nicke will continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports item manufacturer and thus increase its competitive advantage. The players respond to the quarterly figures - the assets of the sports item manufacturer increase by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about the football profile Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has joined a life-long stadium ban against a fan. The defender from Brazil was replaced by the fans on Instagram. Jesus published his private messages and asked his club to take action. "@officialismo You already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Stand by to be who I am," wrote the 28-year old man who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The union responded later on Thursday. He reported the account of the fan at Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma stakeholders should never visit a game of the union again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in the Italian football. Regularally scan Italian fans racial competitions against black players rivaling men. "We cannot have racism in society or sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. We must identify the responsible and withdraw from the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend.
The Italian authorities, however, had recently given discussions about the accession of Juventus Turin. 38 randomized fans of the Rector Juventus Turin have now been banned with stadium bans. Four of them should no longer attend the stadium for a period of ten years, the police shared with the others.
The fans are associated with ongoing detections against twelve leaders of Ultra fans in the area of Juventus. The twelve are caused by severe repression, money laundering and private violence. The club had brought the findings with a notice last year.
The ultra-inhibitors are supposed to stick to Italian media reports after the black trade with tickets. They had "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fancurve, and Juventus employees should have been forced to come to a more affordable map.
Generation Z: Are they really different than Generation Y?
Millenniums are narcissistic, the generation Z is politically - all year round is considered with graphic designations. If you look closer, the drawings are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the special feeling of young people?
"The Krabs Come!" started with this call on 21 September officially at the Gucheng Sea in Gaochun, where the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival was announced by the Department for Public Works of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which is one of the national environmental areas of the province of Jiangsu. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has excellent environmental conditions with a mix of "30 per cent mountains, 20 per cent water areas and 50 per cent fields". The large natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, the people in Gaochun had already started with the power supply. Over the course of time, the coal industry has developed into a prosperous sector that has contributed to high income and has become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In the past years, Gaochun has been actively involved in a major, ecological and scientific development of the power supply as well as a technical support of the coal industry.
In recent years Gaochun has introduced a reform to "distribute power, optimisation of administration and administration services" and has carefully developed the service network for "agreements under a roof, a criminal prosecution team, a network for services, a platform for credit delivery". In order to optimise the city's environment for approval, services and development.
Gaochun creates the advantages conferred on the ground by the link to the South Jiangsu and South-South Anui in the South-South Jiangsu and South-South Anui in full and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an excuse for the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an excuse for the development zone and its position as an international international "Slow City" as an excuse to provide for the promotion of intelligent high-end production companies, intelligent high-end production companies, bio-end production companies, bio- and medical and environmental engineering, energy and environmental protection of the environment, from the cultural resources of cultural resources, cultural resources, cultural resources, cultural resources and health services, as well as in the "3+2" agricultural sector, while at the same time, at the same time, Gaochunun has established the development of the development of the development zone and the development of the development of the region of the South-of the South-of the South-of the South-of the South-of the South, in the South, at the South, at the South, at the South, at the South-of the South, at the South, at the South, at the South here, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at at the same, at the same, at this, at this, at at at at this, at at at at at at the same, at at at the same, at at at at the same at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at this, at this, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at this, at the same, at this, at this, at the same, at this, at this, at the same, at the Community, at the Community, at the Community, at this point, at this, at this, at at at at at the same time, at this, at at the Community, at the Community, at the Community, at the Community, at this point, at this, at the Community, at the Community, at the Community, at the Community, at this, at this, at the Community, at the Community, at the point, at the Community, at this point, at this point, at the point, at the point, at the Community, at this point, at the same time, at the Community, at the Community, at the Community, at this, at the Community, at the point, at this point, at this point, at this point, at this, at the point, at the point, at the point, at the point, at the point, at the point, at the point, at the same time, at the Community, at this point, at this point, at the same time, at the same time, at the same time, at the point, at the same time, at the point, at the same time, at the same time, at the same time, at the same time, at the same at the same time, at the same time, at the same time, at the same time, at the same time, at the same, at the same, at the same at the same, at the same, at the same time, at the same at the same, the same, the same, at the same, at the same, at the same at the same, at the same, at the same at the same at the same at the same at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same at the same, at the same at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same at the same at the same at the same at the same, at the same, at the at the same, at the same, at the same at the same at the same at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same at the same at the same, at the same at the same at the same at the same at the same at the same,,, the same,, at the same, at the same at the same, at the same at the same,,,, at the same, at the same, at the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, at the same, at the same it it it it it it it it is is is is is is, the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the same, at the
Conflict between Iran and the United States: peace talks of the end of sanctions - Trump protested
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN-voltage meeting, spoke of an alleged offer by the United States to withdraw sanctions. The United States had set a final end to all sanctions on its official website in connection with Teherer's leadership.
However, US President Donald Trump told Iranian officials about Twitter: "The Iranians wanted me to raise the sanctions against him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the case as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says I have sanctions," added Ruhani. The types of criminal measures that should be terminated have been discussed. "And they have clearly said we have all sanctions."
However, if this forecast is not carried out in an acceptable manner, criticised silence. In view of the current criminal measures and "the atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met Ruhani in New York. In the background, the hope of Europe, which had been negotiated with Russia and China, was to stop the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy Earth Bees near Istanbul - Fast 200 Bees
After the western Turkey was struck within a short time by two earthquakes, fear grows in front of a disaster. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the storm on the morning, almost 200 babies have been given, Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for safety reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. On Thursday, the earthquake of the strength 5,8 had hit the Marmarmar region before Istanbul and panicked in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for future earthquakes, announced Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for bebes, Istanbul's Mayor Erem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the recent danger is always ignored. Every year, bad housing is destroyed - among other things by the many smaller lands that Istanbul regularly destroys.
City planners such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas that have been built in the centre as resorts are long built. On the first 20th of August, the building room of Istanbul had warned that it would cost a million buildings in Istanbul not to be landless.
The epicenter of the bebebes of the Donnerday was located in the Maramarameer in front of the area of Silivri and in about seven kilometers deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad announced. A smaller followed-by-beam provided a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbuler Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was not first reported on Twitter with, injured or injured. The state-owned TRT showed people who fled panic from the homes. Students were brought in the area of Silivri from security grounds from the buildings. Some students wore clothes as to how to see images.
Istanbul is particularly affected by earthquakes. Among the Marmarameer is a section of the so-called North Atlantic disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and anatomical continent. Turkey is once again hit by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the bee in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people came to life.
Researchers feared that a earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 might strike the ground. However, when it hits the ground, it is unclear. On Thursday, when the earthquake hits the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called Go Bags with all necessary packages in addition to household controls, and schools bring children with them how to deal with when the earth wakes up. If the next big bees come, be clear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that after his return from New York, eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Immmmaglu followed the developments of the Istanbul disaster coordination centre (Akom). Following this information, two mines of Moscow were destroyed in the districts of Avcilar and Sarier.
Warning about Next life in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic. Buildings were awakened. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephones were interrupted. Whether they were smarter than the day of the service, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Halfmonds, Kerem Clinic, warned of coming. He called on people to stay away from the buildings that were visible damages.
The time of the bee is given official data by 13.59 hours (intermediate time). Just a few minutes after the first bee, according to CNN Turkey, there was a follow-up of 4.0 on the direction scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 struck the Turkish marble region - it was to be sprayed up to Istanbul. Even its epicenter was located in the Marmarameer west of the million metropolis, sharing with the disaster protection authority Afad on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused damage on this day of service: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers suggest that it could happen sooner or later to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tetanus plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually disappear - and massive damage will occur.
The Earth’s Cycling of Ersoy calculates that the Earth’s Beam is a warning now. It is likely that it has become more useful, he said to CNN Turkey. “This could be the signs of a larger earth,” Ersoy said to the sender. “Before or later the great bees will also come.”
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the bee had solved great anxiety in Istanbul. In Albania it had also given a severe earthquake just a few days ago - there were 68 injuries. This year the land had also been damaged.
Parliament: New substance in Ukraine-Affair
Two broken documents provide for a new substance in Ukraine's procurement for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible formalization procedure, US Democrats are strengthened: The complaints made by an anonymous indicator about Trump and its controversial telephone with the Ukrainian president raise important points of objections to the president. Trump himself sees himself once more as a victim of a "hexenjagd". He also questioned the credibility of the Whiteman's faith.
USA: Flights from United Airlines in Toilette - Flights around
Since a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines was remanded. The WC-Tur had been blocked during the flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline shared with US media.
At an extraordinary intermission landing in the middle of the night in Denver, the woman was finally released from the cheap cabin. After about an hour she had been locked in, U.S. media were written on other passengers. To continue the flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In an Internet-wide video that is supposed to come from the US media of flight 1554, it is to see how many people try to free the woman. "We're working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We're gonna get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it.
The kakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unknown.
Inspired by Franz Kafkas, famous story "The Turn" the British Successor Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The Roman "Die Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will appear in Germany on November 27, part of the Diogenes Verlag (Zürich). It is about the conversion of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or arrested in his previous life, but now on one of the most powerful men in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the people's will in effect and is willing to let himself be held by nothing and nobody.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When Parliament is closed, the government cannot be called out at a critical moment, if the Soviet leader lies as well as the Soviet leader, if the Brexitiers in high positions just resuscitate the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer must ask what he can do. There is only one answer to: write it."
Kafkas, published in 1915, is the first story published by Gregor Samsa, who looks forward to the morning and sees himself "as an unrecorded stranger," after and after family and society is excluded and finally goes on. "Ian McEwan stands before Kafka to describe a world that is the head," said Diogenes Verlag.
The EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 cars in Austria and Hungary receive flutter brakes to reduce noise pollution through goods. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electricalized.
This should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, as stated by the EU authority, and the funds come from the EU-infrastructure summit "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travel until 31 October
The German travel operator Thomas Cook said that one day after his request for insolvency, all the trips would be cancelled until 31 October 2019. Travels could "not be taken for reasons of insolvency", the company said on Thursday afternoon.
This includes bookings from the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Booker Travel and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid fully. As it is for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, the further steps will be examined.
Thomas Cook, in Germany, was in the corner of the British parent company and had applied for an Insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, which includes, among other things, Neckermann travel, Öger Tours and Booker travel, is employed in Germany about 2000 people.
Insurance wants to transfer hotels from now on
In spite of this holiday, hotels in the country that still host Thomas-Cook-Urlüber are expected to receive money from the Zurich insurance. Payments to hotels are based on the condition that holidayers are no longer required for extra payments.
On the basis of booking information and without submitting special invoices, the hotels in the resorts should now receive 50 per cent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately invited to or otherwise used for individual payment of hotel calculations," said the speaker Bernd Engelien.
The insurance responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodation on their own terms. Some then had to put more than EUR 1000 on the table. The German travel link (DRV) and the federal association of the consumer centres had criticized this grave.
As many hotels are concerned, they will be agreed on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, the insurance speaker said. According to the Donnerday, there were more than 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschallauler from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured Thomas-Cook customers' holiday and return.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The announced payments to hotels by Zurich insurance, however, only help travelers who are still on their way. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly first in the holiday, it looks bad. Later Donnerstagbend told the company that all trips would be cancelled until 31 October. This applies also to such bookings that have already been paid.
As it is about starting on 1 November 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined. In principle, the insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is suspended. dpa
The company refers to the insurance policy which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform on the Kaera website about the possibility of reimbursing the travel price and apply their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroyed Spring in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has been leading the engagement of Lady Diana. In Africa, he is now moving directly to his mother's tracks.
The British Prince Harry in Angola, dressed with a blue splitter shield, has burned and destroyed an explosive.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trusts at the site of Dirico, he set up the south-east TV station in the early morning before running cameras. In a safe way, the explosive bodies in the Savannenland were deployed without damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relicts of the century's bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mines that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip to Huambo, Harry wanted to walk directly to the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same springmaster who accompanied his mother, he wanted to return the way she had gone. The images on which Princess Diana 1997 went through a spacious mine field were going around the world. She also had shown support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip that began in the South African tourist metropolis Capstadt since Monday.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not be guaranteed a third uptake of Brexit negotiations. But what statements are made in the polarising United Kingdom already from time to time. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom is moving like a damocle sword over the blond ship. Its suspension of Parliament to enable its Brexit course to be carried out until the east date was cancelled. And a law adopted by Parliament obliges Johnson to enter into separate negotiations with the EU until 31 October.
Boris Johnson still holds Deal for possible
However, the pressure does not seem to go too far to Johnson. In the meantime, he made statements that he supported an extension of the negotiations by the end of October when he visited a hospital.
You know, we're gonna keep the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that it hurts.
And the time is generally spent by the Brexit dealers in Brussels. For about six weeks, the EU and the British contractors have had the opportunity to prevent an Austrian British from entering the European Union without an agreement. However, the latest talks have not been broken. An agreement seems more difficult by the end of October. The letter of the British Prime Minister does not appear to be the law, but the opposition does not violate the Prime Minister's words. You are afraid that Johnson could, in the case of a No-Deal, be able to pass the Brexit anywhere.
U.S. Authority: Other deaths by E-Zigarten
The number of deaths in connection with the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, between 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this connection, the U.S. Health Authority shared with CDC. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine has already shown that more than 900 people have been affected, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still unclear. In Europe, there is no similar increase in lung damage.
Fear of New Protests in Egypt
Millions of videos by Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks. The producer and actor living in Spain asks for a "Volks revolution". For today's freeday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Egypt's military, with critical corruption and mistrust. Ali hopes for mass competition with a million participants in central parts of the country.
The security authorities have been alarmed at any time. In the centre of Cairo, there was already an increased police presence. Several U train stations were closed, roads were closed around the central Tahrir Square. In the past days, the police had strengthened their road controls and the telephones of foot soldiers were partially on news and photos in relation to Protestants.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last week there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. One such open protest had not been given in Egypt for years. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) Human Rights Organization, almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arrested voluntarily - only because they were "in the wrong time at the wrong place", HRW was involved in prosecution of legal prisoners.
The organization also criticised Zensur in the North African country. The government in Cairo's websites and online services are blocking further protests against al-Sisi. The general governs the country since 2013, after he has defeated the democratically elected Islamic president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially condemned in the past years.
Ocean Change: Arved Fuchs of Greenland Expedition Back
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs was returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg port, including by the shipper Boris Herrmann, the air-conditioning scientist Greta Thunberg, with the rent of "Malicia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs studied and documented the consequences of earthquake in the past months on his ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coast of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future Movement is a blessing, says the Polar Researcher. He's been waiting for years for the young generation to sign up for word. It's been known for decades that the earth is warm. Still, many did as it went on a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often found under the exception of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of earth’s heat and pollution of the sea. When the expedition was measured, among other things, with a thin green glass line and was measured using a net according to microplastic.
For his "fighting for a sustainable and respectful use of the world sea" the Polar Researcher from Bad Bramstedt in Hamburg was awarded the Seadevcon Maritime Award. "For all of us who survive the oceans in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said shipper Boris Herrmann at the price lease. "It is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in the last decade."
Your Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for rents 430 euros
430 Euro for two Teller Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: It seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The account with 80 Euro drink money was paid by the two women, but they posted the quote on Facebook, which has solved today's reactions.
"These cases are damaging to the view of Rome. We ask the police to ask whether it is a meeting here," asked a speaker from Federagit, who asked the travel leader in Rome according to the Roman daily Il Messaggore (freeday edition).
The reaction of the owner of the restaurant soon came. The Japanese had not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to take account. Also, a drink of up to 20 percent of the account is normal, meaning the host price.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is closed? U.S. President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an official procedure that the Democrats want to examine as quickly as possible with their investigation at the representative's house - the talk is from weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensskyj. The president of the White House, who spoke out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States with his complaint, is a monster: the President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for a change in the election of 2020. He has used Ukraine's dependence on it and wants it to exert such a strong influence on a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to follow up in the record published in the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not repeat the full sentence. The telephone from 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story, in which there is a lot of history, in addition to Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the public's view in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis reported travel plans in Ukraine. He wants to meet with the elected President Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer knows very well that his views are bad. "We don't get into a choice, we don't mix us into an intelligence, we have the right," he says. He could say, it's unfair, but he doesn't want to be persecuted in Ukraine, for which there is no reason - "because this information can be very helpful to my clients and be helpful to me," he says.
The lawyer and former New York Mayor seem to have been infected with the right anti-candidacy fantasies that were fixed on Trump's anti-candidacy at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had been inspired by actors in Ukraine, critics at the time said to build an opportunity for Russia's media in the United States. However, this proposal was never serious.
This is precisely what the trumpet is said about in July on the telephone with Selenskyj. The version of Giulianis and the President says: The former Vice-President and now prominent candidates for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, have been pressured by the Ukrainian Government to release the then Ukrainian General Government, Viktor Scokin, and, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company, his son Hunder Biden was active in his supervisory board.
In fact, the run was something different. When Joe Biden asked the Ukrainian general government to go, the charges against the gas company were already closed, hundreds of Biden were never directly affected.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users around the world report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. This is mainly due to Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. On the website all-instruments.de users report that Facebook has not been invited since about 15.30 hours. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the interruption, although not yet in the same range.
Instagram and Co. exacerbating disorders
It's not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services were lost for several hours. And, as in previous cases, users also get back to Twitter this time, especially to make their sick air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean airships of the Antarctica ice. They were on their way with a shooting boat and several miles away from their base than their engine had failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour, the Chilean rescuer needed to recover.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Force:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message that just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the shooting boat."
Poland has been working on King George Island since 1977 with Henryk Arccowski Polish Antarctica Station, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have certainly been brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE wireless upload
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used yet.
As the last few new smartphones have come to the market, which support wireless downloads and sell very well - all in front of the new iPhone-11 models, we want to call a study from the beginning of July to remember. The wireless loading of mobile devices is extremely practical but not recommended.
High temperature set Akku to
Researchers are warning against cableless loading of smartphones. This is said to be the knowledge of the University of Warwick, which is extremely harmful for the devices. For this reason, it is the significantly higher temperature. If a normal phone per cable is set up, the battery is built within three hours of 27 degrees. When the cable is loaded, the researchers have measured themselves at the perfect direction of the smartphone on the laptop. The phone is slightly closer to the mirror, the temperature increases. In addition to this, the water pressure of the loadpad, which also increases the power consumption in the height.
Capacity and time of life
According to the researchers, the temperature for the sustainability of Akkus is a decisive factor. Since each degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery is not only able, but it also does not last much longer. The duration of life is therefore less than that. Researchers are therefore advised to load up the smartphone regularly via cable. Since an interest in modern smartphones is always connected with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has finally increased the cost of an accessive even once - and even for all iPhones.
Practical
The technique is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a suitable charging pad - they are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is loaded without a light cable satellite and a huge stack of stickers. Since Qi (which stands for inductive energy transmission) is a global standard, even with Apple, there are few restrictions. However, the technology should be used only in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 million in six months
A Nepalese mountain climber has owned his own data within just six months 13 of the world's highest 14 mountains. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the peaks of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus has a record of his expeditions.
The former soldier wants to celebrate every 14 million in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international hits: from him, a picture of mountain climbers who stand on Mount Everest Schlange in the morning.
The image of the massandrandrant resolved a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848-metre high mountain and the highest peaks of the earth. In May, in less than a few days, eleven climbers died in the siege.
A problem for Purja could be resolved by the 14th millennium: the Chinese authorities are currently closing the Xixabanma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is called the worst weather. In the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to speak with China to enable him to rise.
Four all elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also an elfantenkuh, a police speaker shared with him on Friday. "We suspected that the elephants had been abandoned."
The four Kadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists. The animals were probably the police speaker between 15 and 25 years of age. An autopsy was arranged to establish the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The killers are often farmers in whose country the animals had previously been kept unharmed. At the same time, about 50 people of elephants are killed each year. This is most likely to happen when the animals move around their habitats.
There are only about 7,000 elephants living in Sri Lanka. On their deaths, theorist is the death penalty.
Pertained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British gold tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas for more than two months after his arrest by Iran. This was known as the Seafarm Bandar Abbas according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Gardens had established the tanker under British flag on July 19th under the pretext of violating the law of sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Critics
The competent Economic Committee of the Sub-House wants to examine the scale of the travel agent Thomas Cook. In this regard, it should go to the board's balance sheet as well as to the question why the British government did not have the financial means to finance the company's survival. "Our interest in the company is also valid for supervision as well as control by external book inspectors," the Committee President Rachel Reeves told London. "It is obvious that we have to do it with a bad example of management".
According to experts, genetics are overestimated at the risk of breast cancer
The role of the gene in the family's increased breast cancer risk has already been overestimated. To this end, researchers from the German Kreb Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come into a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are likely to be more difficult than ever. This has consequences for calculations of the individual breast cancer risk, stressing the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk read increasing Tesla actions
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the branch blog "Electrek". The demand was strong so that Tesla 110'000 orders could be booked, as it continues in Moscow's round writing.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the company. In order to do this, Tesla must provide as many resources as possible.
Customers reported the information: Teslas shares went with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. The course has not been available for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95'000 cars well and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. 2019 wants to deliver 360'000 to 400'000 cars as a whole. In order to do this, in running and coming quarter years, six-digit numbers are needed. In particular, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is requested, but there are few benefits. In spite of the tree, there have been a loss.
Will the British government turn the Brexit Bridge? Johnson retreating
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for an environment of the last law decided by Parliament against an irregular Brexit.
The law provides that the government must apply for an extension of the term of exit, no agreement should be reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitalisation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister, John Major, had announced on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political schemes" to change the law. Johnson could use a procedure that would transfer the entry of the law to the time after the EU Austria.
Johnson said he was seeking an agreement with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU will leave on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran's apparent Uran achievement is high
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased his pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the struggle for the salvation of the historic Atomic Agreement. "It is a sad fact that the European States are not able or in need of any concrete action," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference near the UN General Assembly in New York. In order not to agree on their promises, he took "more steps" from the 2015 agreements.
The conflict is based on the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a result, involves the commitment to normalise economic relations. The United States, in 2018 alone, comes out of the agreement to force Iran with "maximal pressure" to a change in its policy of aggression. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with a higher level of charges and, among other things, reacts to severe sanctions against Tehran.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing for use with Uran in early September. Following IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 additional centrifuge.
The Europeans may not be ready to take their share of the deal and therefore leave Iran alone with the costs and burdens of US-pressive ventures, Rohani would have to be able to give further talks that would hopefully lead to a solution.
Rohani continues to pursue Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Huthi rebels in Yemen had been known to attack what the United States was accused of as false knowledge. "We didn't do this," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who commit such accusations have to prove it," said Rohani. However, the European leaders had not been able to speak with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they had only claimed that the rebellions in Yemen could not have taken place as they did not. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past few days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, Rohani had first to raise the broad sanctions of the US administration. He asked the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and purpose".
Comets from other stars across the solar system
Astronomers have now observed a comet from the depths of the world. This has been achieved only once. The comet allows backlinks to other solar systems.
What was once just a confusion is now confirmed: an interstellar guest across our solar system. The comet from the depths of the world space was baptized after its discovery on 2I/Borisov and increased the interest of astronomers throughout the world.
The largest comet was discovered on August 30th by the Amateurastronome Gennadi Borissow at the Margo observatory on the Crime - with a self-constructed telescope of 65 centimetres across the street. The observations of various observers not only confirmed that it is a comet that is unknown, but also showed that it is not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object seen after 1I/'Oumuumaa of 2017, which was seen on a journey through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers the rare chance to get close to sights in a foreign solar system before it departs on the Numbers. Firstly, it shows that the interstellar comet that resembles our own system as the astronomical institute of the Canary Islands reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, approximately 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is significantly above the typical speeds of objects that cross the sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Authority Nasa in a communication.
The comet is then on the basis of the analysis of a so-called hyperbelt path that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomy Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and classification of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverers, the interstellar Swiss stars, first introduced under catalogue number C/2019 Q4, have been named 2I/Borisov, indicating that it is the first part of the name that it is addressed to the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers have been lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumumaa, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in the field. So researchers remain for months of research. "The object will be the greatest light and will be seen by mid-December and then by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "This will only be seen by October 2020 only with larger, professional telescopes".
Several observers have already taken the visitors into the audience. Thus a team on Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which has already led to the characterization of 1I/'Oumumaa, in a first survey of the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Taking up the gemini observatory on Hawaii shows a significant shift of the comet.
Researchers and researchers from the Canadian Astrophysicical Institute (IAC) have already won a first-mentioned spectrum by the interstellar Switzerland, which offers a type of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation is easy to see that comets can be formed in other solar systems through similar processes as in ours, complemented by the Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of the same two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly start a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the Agency will station the three-dimensional range "Comet Interceptor" (Germany about comets) on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometers away from the Earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, you will either run on a new, fresh comet from our own solar system or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumumaa.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is so far: At the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of the Chinese United Airlines was created, a special honor for Captains and Crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers were scheduled to be sent to the new airport every year, and in 2025 it was already 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion prize projects. China's most recent loan project is also called "seas" because of its six-star construction structure.
The complex has four starting and landing routes to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new bus transports passengers in just 20 minutes in the city of Beijing.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly allowed Berlin to learn from Beijing. The opening of the building in 2006 - and significantly smaller - the main city airport in Germany has been relocated. In Beijing, however, after four years, there was a first passenger machine.
New aircraft to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the UK Space Agency dreams of the UK Space Agency. It is possible for these, who, for the past 2030 years, have been playing a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breething Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company has developed Reaction Enginees from Oxfordshire, the US-Sender CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could be definitively manufactured," said the sender. "We are talking about the 2030s of the year's, and the work has been very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to cooperate with the Australians more. A flight from the UK capital to the Australian Metropole takes about 20 hours. As a single passenger car, the Concorde from 1976 to the establishment of its 2003 operation covered the New York Paris route and used three to three hours for it. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a contract on the Paris airport of Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 passengers were alive. In the past year, the US-American airport of Lockeed Martin Plane was known as a single passenger plane.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things on its home page. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient journeys with a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the switch. In addition, such aircraft are also usable outside the Earth's atmosphere and enables the "next generation to have reusable frames".
Respiratory in Washington: Trump wants anonymous tipper in Ukraine-Affrey
In Ukraine, for the possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to raise potential prominent positions in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," said Trup on Thursday before the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and with such a "a little different" in the past than today.
The event was considered to be an invitation test against tippingers. The event was actually not public. However, several US media distributed audio media on Friday. Democrats responded to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for an official anti-trump procedure. Their proposals are based mainly on the written complaints of an anonymous secret servant, who raised serious charges against Trump and its government centre.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants more government employees to have information about how the US President "uses his office" to achieve the ability of another country to join his interests in the US election 2020.
At the center of the front, there is a controversial telephone between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj Ende juli, in which Trump encouraged his fellow officials to investigate, which could damage his political rival Joe Biden. It is about the former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and the alleged efforts to protect his spraying in front of Ukrainian justice.
The White House was accused of seeing the Ukrainian telephone also of fraud: leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As was usually an electronic word language protocol. This was followed by a speech on the appointment of lawyers from the White House but was removed from a database normally intended for this and instead stored in a special protected system. Thus, only a large speech protocol was published.
The identity of the indicator is not known publicly. The "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be a member of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote among others, the "so-called whistleblower" has spread information from second hand, which had appeared as inappropriate. So there may be no tipper or spy.
How Trup reacted to those who were supposed to have played the Whistlelower's information, however, came to an end. The president of the U.S. representative house, Nancy Pelosi, reacted in a manner that encouraged and emphasized that Trump's statement was once again the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting various trials against Trump and its environment for several months in various committees. In view of Ukraine's probation, the Democrats are now looking forward to new developments in order to put in place a possible procedure against Trump.
"The Wistblower has given us a driving plan for our investigation," said the head of the Committee of Secret Service at the representative's house, Adam Ship.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy area who were mostly involved in democratic, but also under the republican presidents were present in a statement published on Friday following the investigation by the Democrats for a possible official assignment procedure.
For the further proceedings, there is no precise timetable. With the majority of the representatives in the House, the Democrats could insist on such an impeccation procedure. The decision on an actual official assignment is valid but in the Senate where the majority of Republicans have a majority.
VW Business Council: Workplaces are built "floating"
The plans of the VW brand, which further reduces the costs of production in Germany and Europe, could lead to the burden of production in Germany and Europe. This concerns the operator's business council. The brand wants to reduce its annual manufacturing costs from ten billion euros to two billion euros by 2023.
A key to this is the staff costs. The 2016 business and business plan, which has been negotiated between the company and the business council, is already planning the construction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be built at the car manufacturer when it is almost proved that the related activities are no longer required. In addition, employment insurance is required until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now comes from business circles, there are jobs in the production that are not actually available, "bad" built on another way - so the official course will not be repeated.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no opportunity to re-establish the re-establishment. In the meantime, many staff lack employment to take greater care of the concerns ahead of the overall deployment of vehicles. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could be withdrawn from and from Germany and Europe because it is more expensive in other parts of the world. From VW, it only stated: "A adjustment of the employment volume is as agreed socially according to the demographic curve".
The brand VW wants to standardize production worldwide more and control new projects centrally. It should also reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and competitiveness. Production president Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "We are well advised in times of uncertainty from the Brexit to the ongoing trade war between the United States and China."
In this way it has already been successful: for example, this year would have been the first time since 2013 the cost of production per vehicle compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for golf 8, which should be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, should be reduced by 1.1 hours. The actual number of production duration is not VW, according to the information of our newspaper, it is about golf 7 round.
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory produced in the vehicle. The works Braunschweig and Salzgitter produced components. For Wolfsburg, VW's interior, the railway line has to be built at 800,000 cars per year so that the work is profitable. 2018, however, in Wolfsburg, only around 700,000 vehicles were released - required by the rare Diesel demand and the problems of conversion to the new consumption and abgas testing procedure.
As Tostmann announced last year, however, a million cars from the band in Wolfsburg will be "perspectively" to play a million cars. This should enable the connection of the golf production in the farm - because Zwickau works through the conversion of the equipment to the location for the e-auto-production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently been developed. Therefore, the expectations now remain on Golf 8.
Voodoo forced to prostitution: Persecuted human dealers
Young women from Nigeria have been subjected to forced labor, forced to flee to the area of hunger and forced to prostitution. Six possible human dealers have to go to prison for this.
Six potential human dealers from Nigeria were sentenced to eight years and three months' imprisonment on Friday in Bochum on Friday. The prosecutors had taken young women from Nigeria into the crying area and forced them to prostitution. To force their obedience, the exiled Nigerians had to remain in the home before a Voodo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years of age. They were brought with the help of Libyan lockers in shell boats across the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed to various boards in order to work on the expected key costs of EUR 25,000.
The prosecutors - four men and two women - had given the lockdown and the subsequent distribution of young Nigerians to boards in the process. "The work made women physically and mentally difficult," said Justice Isabel Hoffmann in the hearing. "Some were right-minded."
The Court of Justice refers to commercial and banditarian closures of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, payrolls, and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo requires negotiations with Airthansa
Fim Duration Strategy with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened flight co-operation with Ufo.
If the company should not return to the negotiating process, the company will "not be informed of the work-related measures in the LH Group on 14 October", Ufo-Takrich told Ufo-Flohr on Friday. Airthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been able to conduct the Ufo tariff negotiations for months. This is also the question of whether the company has been properly informed about the transaction at the airport.
In this point, Ufo is now in favour of a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the tariff contracts were not announced. The court showed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the legal means. "That a second court sees the whole thing differently, I am unlikely to hear," said Ufo President Florh.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Court of State for a fair review of the status of Ufo as a trade union. The company argues that the company has not used a representative board for months and therefore is not able to fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
In the past, there was a strong leadership struggle in the team, during which several members of the board and the company were back, including the longtime business manager Nicole Baublies. The Ufo, because of their doubts about their leadership, had already made an infamous vote on the rules of the cabin staff at Eurowings End of July.
Facilitated entrances: Saudi Arabia announces new Visa System
So far Saudi Arabia has not only been known as an international tourist magnet, but it should change now. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visas.
With a new Visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors rose to 100 million per year, and the tourism Commission shared with it.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is still hard available for tourists. Visas usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors to the western state. With the new rules, the former conservative kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. After its own request, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, two of the most important oil plants in East Saudi Arabia had been found: the largest oil refinery in the country in Abkhaik and the oil field of Churais. As a result, the national oil production was tragic, the oil prices dropped to the height. It may last for several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom once again reached its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber stick in preparations for the wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding party. The model posted on Thursday (Order time) in her Instagram stories several party photos on which they are to see in the white wedding day. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others have organized a youth-line interview in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several tapes, including tapes printed by Bananas on Instagram and said to his followers: "Help me to choose my entertainment for the wedding." The promi couple wanted to marry the next week.
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves the Ja-word in a New York State office. A bigger party had not given it at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that both of them had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't make a relationship."
Two deaths in Chechnya
Two people came to life at the turn of a small plane in western Chechnya. The workshop was discovered on Friday in a forest area in the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police shared with him. When he died, it was about 38 years old and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for Donnertagbend after the machine, after the possession of a emergency signal per GPS. In the search there was also a military bomber in use. The accident has yet to be detected. It is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (pilzens) and 100 kilometers north of Regensburg.
Half of Europe's trees are threatened by extinction
In addition to damages, diseases, land-based species, non-sustainable wood scarcity and the growth of the city caused threats, the IUCN World Conservation Union reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all Europe's famous 454 trees. 265 of these are no other continent. 58 per cent of these are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of risk and are thus at risk of extinction.
The IUCN shares endangered species in six categories: from "potentially endangered" over "damaged", "highly endangered", "damaged from extinction" and "dead in nature" to "dead". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as being threatened.
Aberse and wild rosescania threatened
In Germany most of the above-mentioned U.S. (Sorbus), one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency, said: "Most of them are threatened because the populations are so small as they are, or because of the transformation or weakness of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild regular Russians. They have been considered "dangerous" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The largest threat is the Balkan miner mote in addition to a pillar. It has spread over the entire continent since the 1980s of South-Eastern Europe and has almost natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Russians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. It is not taken into account in this assessment that the trees in cities, parks and all.
Strawberries and moose also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for Meats, Strawberries and Moose. More than a fifth of the soft animals and moose and almost half of all the species are threatened, as is the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the forest, the interconnected species, agricultural practices and climate change. The soft animals, such as the snow, played a key role in recycling food in the soil and being an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation for many of the above-mentioned and underestimated species is predominate, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, director of the European Office. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and to give priority to the protection of these species."
Ground floor in front of Istanbul: 34 reported injuries
At the latest earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. It was said that there were no reports. Thousands of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were subsequently damaged. Since the spring of the morning, there have been almost 200 children. The earthquake of the strength 5,8 had destroyed the Marmar region before Istanbul on Thursday, and panicked in the millions of metropolis.
Now, the government wants to introduce a Commission to prepare the country better on land, announced Oktay. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for bees, Istanbul's Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Istanbul is particularly affected by earthquakes. Under the Marmarameer there is a section of the so-called North-East Atlantic disturbance marking the border between the euro area and the anatholic continent.
One of the worst bee was one of the 7.6 strong in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölckýk, southeastern Istanbul. More than 17,000 people came to life.
Already on Tuesday, the region had been hit by a storm of 4,6. The authorities called on the inhabitants to continue the damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLO) and Shakira take part in half-time show
The Latin pop singer Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will introduce the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. That gave the singers the name on Twitter. "Greater will not be it," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was reluctant to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be as far as Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996, she's been around to meet Super Bowl - at the time she's seen Diana Ross flying in the semi-time show in heaven. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to be perfect with another Latina." You can hardly expect it to show "what we girls can do on the largest stage of the world."
Shakira showed in a statement that she felt ashamed, besides another artist standing on one of the world's largest pools and representing Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time that the two "kings" were together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against sensitive obstetrics
The Super Bowl is the highest point of the American football season. The game and half-time show are part of the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you've been tired lately: in February, the spectrum in the United States closed to the smallest audiences for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still nearly a hundred million people in the range.
About the half-time show of the past Super Bowl had given it in advance: In the struggle to deal with quarterback Colin Kaupernick, topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear in the last February media reports. Finally, the half-time group Maroon 5 launched the critics.
Kaapernick, then quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, was in the game 2016/17 before NFL plays at the national stage of protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaapernick released a movement, many players took over the guest. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked most African football stars. Kaapernick himself has been unarmed since March 2017 and has no longer fought a NFL party. He proposes not to arrest him for political reasons.
Cook plate: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks may be pleased to receive a press report from the travel provider Thomas Cook. There are high comments on outstanding loans and loans. This is also the case with the Swiss Credit, writing the "Financial Times" in their release from Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse had to carry out a total of up to 1.8 billion British funds (about EUR 2 billion), such as the report.
The lenders of loans had to take out from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors from 550 million to 825 million pounds. In fact, the amounts to be written should be higher at the top of the band's size, one expert said to the sheet.
How big the losses of believers will be at the end will be shown after the end of the insolvency procedure. A process close to this person has not promised too much hope. For example, about 40 cars from Thomas Cook in Britain are "al" and many of the property are in bad condition. Most of the money could probably be stolen with the sale of airport slots as well as the brand Thomas Cook.
Rackettes are supposed to have brought potential killers to Italy
The Sea-Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have been tortured and tortured in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't have any secure information to do it," said the spokesman of the Sea-Watch refugee organization, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had re-known the three men in Italy. They were urged to be raped, tortured and killed in Libya's people. The possible perpetrators were arrested in the host of the Italian Messina.
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th and had a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects should also be there.
U.S. Federal Government warns before Huawei
The head of the US Internet Office Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government to trust the Chinese network director Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," said Pai to the "handsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which each company has committed "under Chinese law" to follow the instructions of the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC Chief continues. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has agreed to request a "trust declaration" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, such as technical solutions, to report the "handelsblatt" on its own information.
Pai suspects that this is possible. The 5G technology does not exist only from hardware:
Since the software is important to keep the devices at the latest, this software consists of billions of lines of code programs that change with time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine," that a government authority, "anywhere, it would be possible to check every single update in real time to raise security risks", continues the FCC Chief.
The Chinese Group Huawei makes extensive contacts with the Chinese State Assembly:
The relationship between the company and the company is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said the Handelsblatt.
The U.S. presents findings that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to acquire the position of the US.
Chemistry factory in northern France: Schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall lights the sky over a northern French Chemistry factory. The fire has been removed after hours - the repairs could last for days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and child arrests were closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be open on Friday, the competent Prefecture was involved. The Ministry of the Interior had called on the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to smoke. There was no damage. Farmers and farmers were invited to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to set the soil first.
The fire could be completely removed on Thursday afternoon as the Prefecture announced. There is still the risk that after the removal of Geruch, the Prefecture was spread on Twitter. According to the Prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police officers were used at Brandort.
The chemical industry had previously produced a giant black smoke oil. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the company's lubrizol factory, the additional oil plant. The production facility is a few kilometers away from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to authorities in the so-called Seveso category of dangerous places that will be monitored in particular. In the Italian Seveso at Milan in 1976, there was a devastating chemical accident.
The president of the region Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the newsman BFMTV that there was no "high toxicity" in samples at first. A deterioration of the nearby Hess could not be excluded. In the river the cities were built against the pollution, the Prefecture explained.
If the fire broke out early in the morning against 02.40 hours, the authorities reported that the reason was not clear at first. Rouen is a regional Metropolis and is located between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest and now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest in increasing economic growth in the euro area.
Germany needs to invest and, even now, better than before," said Le Maire on Thursday at the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the euro area is weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation deteriorates in order to make the necessary decisions."
Trade had to be done by those countries that had budget spaces for more investments, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these games, added the Minister and pointed to the high debt of his country. This is more than 98 per cent of the gross domestic product. The French debt must be "stabilized" and "cut," said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments in order to survive the European economy.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax reliefs of more than EUR nine billion for households.
The French government therefore reacts to the protest of the money laundering movement. The new debt should fall by 2.2 per cent, after expected 3.1 per cent this year.
Is he still trying to pull?: Johnson weighs question about Brexit Tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson criticises the "Capitulation Act" which Parliament has adopted.
Parliament is back, a law proposes to the British Premier to avoid a Chaos-Brexit. Critics feared that Boris Johnson could still use a battalion.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to pass an irregular Brexit, despite the last law decided by Parliament, which is to be prevented.
The law provides that the government must apply for an extension of the term of exit, no agreement should be reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitalisation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister, John Major, had announced on Thursday that he could try to use "political schemes" to change the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure that would move the entry of the law to the time after the EU Austria. Johnson said he was seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings explained that he felt the political austerity regulations about Brexit as a "space walk in the park" and was confident that the intended EU Austria was still able: "We enjoy what we will win, we will (e.g. Red: from the EU), no worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" followed by a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as the head of the Downing Street UK government. He is going to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the prime minister in a terrible situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - all of them stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which became one of the very big rock photographs. But it must not always be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (tasks) is deeply rooted in the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda's death in 1998, was obviously proud and proud when he presented the photo band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the Launch Event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a quick look at the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the imagination of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the sofortmacy of the polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied the history of art at the University of Aizona until she found it in photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, a few hundred of which are now first published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, styles, landscapes, several hamsters, a creature in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "They wanted real moments," writes artist Ekow Eshun in his speech. And of course, there is still one in the middle: Your husband Paul - as you may never have seen him.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on the stairs, telephones in the bathroom with a baby on the head, or wears beautiful moonboats. Surely the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but it was not always with the McCartneys.
Like no other medium, the polaroid camera is starting at the right moment. Linda McCartney's recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snacks.
It's about the choice of click: You have to recognize if you pass a great photo before you. And then you have to cut it at the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you hit it two seconds later or two earlier, it can be a whole different picture." And Linda had the gift, always the right moment. "She knew it was easy," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
The light, the composition, the image cuts and the colors, which "The Polaroid Diaries" makes not only a continuous picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure for all anecdotics, where landscapes have already been acting as abstract images. The perfect addition to the new album "Abbey Road", which appeared just 50 years ago.
"We're going to buy more oil and gas from Iran."
The Turkish President Recep Taiyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not break the oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our Earth gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN vol.
However, it was argued that Turkey had problems with imports of Iranian soil oil, since some companies had "recovered due to US pressures".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "to continue our relations with Iran in particular on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who has repeatedly criticised the US chances against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its rise from the International Atomic Agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is secretly pursuing an atomic programme and does not adhere to the Agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the introduction of Iran's oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, the tensions in the Gulf region have been very strong.
U.S. Government wants to restrict the recruitment of refugees
The U.S. government wants to severely restrict the recruitment of refugees. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Thursday that the annual ceilings for a new residence programme would be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is equivalent to an average of 40 per cent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to be committed to the support of refugees. But the most important task is to protect US citizens and serve them.
The US Government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are at risk, as is the statement made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
At the 1980 programme, refugees from UN stocks are selected in all over the world and relocated in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The current threshold of 30,000 is a deep value. As the US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House, left, the figure was almost 85,000.
"This is a very sad day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would continue to undermine its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump tries to limit immigration in the United States as illegal. The US government expects its own data for the next budget year 350,000 asylum applications. These figures are different from the new settlement program.
Donald Trump - "Comes to a Spitzel"
U.S. President Donald Trump has been involved in the release of the spy's Whistleblower. Anyone who, as a result of his abuse of power, has managed to "come close to a mirror", said Trump, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. The reports are consistent with several US media.
After that, Trump spoke before the staff of the United States UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the White Bookman about the controversial events in the White House, he replied, "It's coming near a mirror." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were sleeping? Right. The spy and Verat, we made it a little different than we do now."
Finally, attention was paid to a possible reflection on the death penalty. The Democrats used harsh criticism of Trump's expulsions and kept him under arrest for witnesses. It also attempted to prevent a congressional investigation into a possible procedure for arresting him, writing to the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Service and Oversight in the House of Representatives.
The Whistleblower calls the president in a complaint published now, to have his office misused to request an admission of another country to the US election 2020. In particular, it is his controversial phone with his Ukrainian official colleague Woodymyr Selensskyj in summer: Trup was close to him in speech to lead investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower is himself and their informants. As the New York Times reports, however, it is about an analysis of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Refugee boat known as baby and baby swim in Ågéis
People are constantly trying to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. On a regular basis, there are often too many small boats. In the course of a shooting boat, there are now seven migrants to come to life - among five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants came to live on a boat. Among the victims of death were a baby as well as four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were thus able to be rescued from the flow of the possession of a pre-fabricated danger.
Among the victims, there should also be a key, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants were out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousse in the north of Chios Island.
Since then, hundreds of migrants from Turkey have moved to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in very small boats. In the past year, 174 people have been living on this route according to the United Nations refugee relief work (UNHCR) of the United Nations (UNHCR).
The Who broke the concert
A U.S. rock band The Who has found an old end because of a lack of leadership by Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the night in Houston, Daltrey said his voice to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it goes."
Leader guitarist Pete Towsend asked for forgiveness and added that Daltrey could "not really speak now". The audience promised Towsend to come at a refurbishment concert at his expense. But a term is still not fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, The Who said they were going to be followed by a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old gang colleague Towsend are the only founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Accommodation immediately set: WeWork allows real estate markets to close
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from the small startup to the driving force on the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork aims to destroy the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set up founder Adam Neumann a few days ago as head, moved the planned delivery process and started with the sale of subsidiaries and securities such as the leadership agency to win financial space for the coming weeks and months. WeWork also reported, among other things, the end of new offers with immediate effect.
WeWork has large office spaces for a long time and offers them short-term in part small units to members. This can be a single liberator, small startups, or entire divisions of large companies. As long as WeWork burns with this business money at an alarming rate. In the past year, the company has incurred a loss of $1.6 billion, at a cost of $1.8 billion. In this year alone, the cost of renting up to $2.5 billion will always be higher. To limit the loss, the new company will now have the necessary brakes and the proposed new facilities.
The "Financial Times" followed by WeWork concluded between rent contracts with periods of up to 15 years, from which commitments of more than $40 billion were made. These huge commitments could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but also for the entire real estate markets.
Economic calculations Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York followed usWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months, nearly 300,000 square meters of office space. Only WeWorks new contracts made the demand for offices in New York to be larger than those that were then new to the market. Without WeWorks expansion, the office's leadership in the US Metropole would have increased at this time, as Alpert wrote in "Business Inside". Similarly, in London, where we work between several thousand office stations is in a better position.
In the UK capital, the balance of the real estate market could also be changed without further expansion of the aggressive startup. In particular, WeWork is the main owner, in a recent year by the Deka fund-provider Deka for nearly 100 million euros purchased office houses in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many tenants have built their properties for the demands of WeWork with high investment. In order to make their business model soon profitable, the real estate owners have to write out a part of the expected billions of purchases. Access to the - without clicking - reserves of WeWork does not have long-term rental contracts. Because the renting of the separate premises of WeWork is usually carried out by any extra-based subsidiary companies, such as Special Purpose Vehicles, which is limited to the parent company.
Russia re-established a number of North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard was again opposed to North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, 262 more foresters, who had been illegally fished in the waters, shared with the Russian National Intelligence Service FSB of the Agency Interfax on Friday.
Just ten days ago 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. The border guards were shot and three of them were wounded. This time, there were no injuries, the Communist North Korea suffered chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were then on their way to Russian waters. Russia's Coast Guard is following its own data to protect its marine resources patrols. During the recent checks, 30,000 Tint Fish were discovered. In addition, three fishing boats and two motorboats were seized and sent to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. The agency Ria Novosti followed the Coast Guard 2018 as a total of more than 8,000 damages.
The Russian Fisheries Authority also did not issue a prison licence to the North Koreans, according to a complaint from a domestic entrepreneur. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been established there since 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the shipping region Primorje, Georgia Martynow, recently also blamed high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They were fighting with highly-managed synthetic networks prohibited in Russia. These would also have taken small habitats from the sea. In addition, the networks would simply be taken into the sea, where they spent 200 years to be transferred. The ships themselves do not violate the hygiene and technical regulations.
Three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured on the night of the arrests in the previous week. A wounded North Koreanman also died after his injuries. On September 17, the Russian border guard first set up a North Korean ship and then a second after the fire opened.
United States of America Entrepreneurship ban against former President Castro
The United States has joined the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children's travel ban. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs established the "great human rights violations" in a communication on Thursday with Castro.
As the leader of the conflict, Fidel Castro, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, was also responsible for human rights violations by the President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, there. "The abuse of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump spoke on Wednesday about a ban on entry into the army of other members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, the United States has been fighting a powerful struggle between the government and the opposition.
Cuba is considered one of the most interconnected Maduros. The socialist Caribbean branch receives oil from Venezuelan oil in exchange for the services of send-on doctors. Following the assessment of the United States and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent a number of secret officials to Venezuela to assist the government in the oppression of government opponents.
New climate test by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people are going to the streets again.
At the end of an international climate week, the movement of Fridays for Future reorganizes actions and competitions in thousands of countries around the world. The beginning must take place because of the age difference in New Zealand and Australia before the protests over Europe to North America. There, climateist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major competition in the Canadian Montreal.
How great the worldwide demand for this Friday will be after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, over four million people have been affected by the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. As long as it gave 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
Especially in Germany, the last Friday was very big. A good third of all world protesters - about 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, a list of the following customer visits were planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in Metropole, such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westernland, people want to go to the street.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of her country for a stronger use of climate protection. This resulted in a short period of time in the freedays-for-Future movement. The climate protests were mainly for students and students, but in an increasing degree also for scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more respect from politics in the fight against earthquakes and emerging climate disasters. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming should be reduced to under 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period.
Less than a month after a two-week transAtlantic storm with a high season in New York, Thunberg had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she held an emotional conversation with the UN in which she spoke to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth at last. In her home Stockholm, she was invited on Wednesday for her use of the alternative Nobel Prize for the Right Lifehood Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
The people in Russia can no longer smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. "This is also true for smoking," said a spokesman of the emergency ministry on Thursday in Moscow of the Agency's Tass. The ban should enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes then has to count with a fine of 3,000 rubles (EUR 42,46). If the cigarette is to fire, the penalty falls higher. Under the ban, the ministry is also subject to burning candles.
Battle against cybercrime - Founder lift server
In the fight against online crime, German investigators first raised a large server provider for illegal business in the darknet.
In total, 13 workers are suspected that a computer centre operator in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trbach on the Moselle hosted a number of websites that deal with the international criminal activities.
This was shared by the General government in Cobléz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday afternoon at a large event. The Darknet is an isolated part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects, including the world's second-largest Darknet Market place for drugs, "Wall Street Market", were supposed to have been the target of the attack by investigators in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom router End of November 2016 was directed by the General State Administration over a server in Cyberbunker.
One such host has been raised in Germany for the first time. A webhost provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the case of access with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been studies in Germany and in the neighbouring countries. They have been the result of almost five years of investigation. On Wednesday, the investigators want to provide further details.
New World Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people today want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate week, the movement of Fridays for Future re-entered actions and competitions in thousands of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests have been planned in at least 65 cities, including Metropolis, Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in Nordrein-Westfalen or Westernland.
Climate testes ← Who really are Thunberg's terminals?
In a world full of war and smoking factories that heat the climate, there are high levels of justice and courage, even in the 21st century. So it's amazing that a 16-year-old girl deserves the power of this time. But what is behind it? Is there help preparation or smooth marketing of a climateist? Historical mastering or manipulative tactics about herself?
On the other hand, Greta Thunberg places the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. It has not been historically seen in Europe that a young man creates a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nicolaus from Cologne has felt excited to use himself for a more just world. At that time, this too has been able to overcome the sea to reach the desired country, as Greta Thunberg has recently made himself on the journey to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shadow page in this regard? Why do you need an action called "We don't have time", to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has plenty of PR managers on her side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has been sold widely, thanks to the existing daughter in the framelight. The old-fashioned follow-up of Greta Thunberg was also a little equipped over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also a few followers too. This is also not without reason, because the action came in the media very well for money and there is a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
The Spirits are now divided: Is it morally right to save themselves from the world's wars? Is it still authentic if certain personal circles work together during the world's rescue action with spring clouds? Whatever the final position is involved, a critical and reflective point of view is always more important in a democratic society, because democracy is living by different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can also make it more likely that certain trends are critical.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest cross by our solar system
A foreign comet crosss at the moment of our solar system.
The beliefs of the astronomers have confirmed: a foreign comet crosss at the moment of our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers have only confused it, but now they are certain: A comet from another star is crossing our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is currently operating around the world astronomers.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by Amateurastronoms on the Crime
The injured body was discovered by an amateurastronome called Gennadi Borisssow on the scene. He looked with a self-constructed telescope into heaven and further observation confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually about an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second type of telescope that has been seen during the journey.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to draw close to the insight into a foreign solar system. Obviously, the comet is similar to our own system, as reported by the Canary Astrophysicical Institute. The comet is clearly an interstellar origin of the International Astronomy Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbole path that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before the attack - and can be observed for several months
However, before it is so far, astronomers can observe him closely. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his influence, which means that he can be examined for many months from the earth. "The object will be achieved by mid-December to be the greatest light and then by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," says Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. Space Authority Nasa. "It will be only with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The president of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumumamaa".
First knowledge about Comet 2I/Borisov promotes hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers across the globe. At the same time, the celestial bodies seem to be similar to our comets - as the IAC nurse Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of Switzerland is similar to ours. This observation is easy to see that comets can form in other solar systems by similar processes, as in ours, added Mr. Javier Licandro.
The observation, however, is based on individual knowledge. Two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, allowing for a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are constantly on the market. Before long, a giant asteroid passed over the earth, and they came near dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely Computable": Rachel Johnson is late for brothers
As for Boris Johnson, it will become one. First of all, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister with clear words commends the military language of the Premier as "unsatisfied." It is not the brother she knew.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands under pressure and continues to speak - at least once again. At the polling hour in the house this Wednesday, the opposition was on a massive rise, and among others there were more critics of words: thousands of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the sender Sky News, her brother used words such as captulating, as if the opponent of an EU institution should be "sustained, beaten, beaten and beaten" and they held this to be too competitive. They did not recognize the version of her brother again, Rachel Johnsons, who was present at the elections to the EU Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Cange UK".
In particular, she said that her brother Jo Cox mentioned that an EU-friendly subsidiary, who was murdered a few days before the 2016 Austrian referendum, could have been killed by a neonaissian. Their reflections could be best appreciated by crossing the Brexit, saying, "It's very uncomfortable to refer to a member of the community who was killed by the 'Britian first'," now criticised Johnson'. The acter was apparently from the right-wing camp, which was strengthened by this kind of language. For all who were suffering, it was very uncomfortable.
The Whiteman of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister. "It hurts me if Joshua's name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to honor them, if you are sad and decide for what you believe - no matter what you look like. But you should never "demonise the other side." He also insisted that an atmosphere would have become more likely to occur in the attack.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, a younger brother of Jo, had lowered his office as state secretary and his mandate as director of the Toury. "I was breaking loyalty to the family and the national interest in the past few months - it's an unsolved tension," Jo Johnson explained the step.
Johnson's language also stood in the church on sharp criticism. As the "Times" report reports, all 118 bishops and bishops of the Church of England criticize the language "this country is not worthy." In a joint state, they stated, "In the past few days, the language, both in debate and outside Parliament, has been unacceptable. We should speak with respect to each other".
Shakara and Jennifer Lopez are on the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: In the semi-time show of the coming Super Bowl, two women with Latin lyrics. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver half-time show at the next end of the US football league NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (Orderday).
"I feel incredibly ashamed and ashamed to represent the Latin community besides Jlo. Because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira shared in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on February 2. In the Metropolis on the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Flower") is a Puerto-canic origin.
"I love it that the Super Bowl puts two women on the stage this time - and two Latins," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-olds were born in New York, after their parents were expelled from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, they were born with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actor and has been seen in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas since November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the Star of a Telenovel and Singerin. She created her first bilingual album in 2001 and the single "Wheever, Whereever".
The recognition of half-time guests is expected in the United States every time. In this year, many also consider the election to be a political gesture. Finally, the country, not the last by President Donald Trump's immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time is a giant show showcase. Artists like Justin Timberlake, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and Rolling Stones were there for Furore. In general, there are more than 100 million TV viewers watching the NFL finish, it is also popular in Germany.
In the past year, there have been political confrontations. For example, the battle against the fourthback Colin Kaupernick, who had refused to protest against the police force against blacks, was held firmly in the play of the National Hymme and was held by US President Donald Trump. Some of the musicians, with Kapernick's solidarity, had rejected a super-bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The rock group Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
An actor and youtuber puts Egypt's Herscher on: First, Mohamed Ali remains in the country.
The two men who had influenced whether Egypt’s streets were again bleeding again, the two weeks on the streets of Egypt have spent both of the past weeks in the country. One of the two Swed back at Cairo Airport on Friday evening. President Abdul Fatath al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-General, who 2013 the Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, who was the first freely elected Head of State of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had asked Sis before political Islam and had no relief of the human rights violations of human rights abuses on the Nile. In one week, the President of the State President of Egypt, Mr.
In the Irreen, this is an attempt in the view of the president of the other man who now decides the case on the streets. Mohamed Ali remained naturally out of the country where he would be arrested if he was an Egyptian floorer. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old player was only a minority of Egypt. Today he is the only one who controls the political discourse in the Cafés, the living rooms and the tees of the country: With his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls his country people against Sisi.
He goes to the Head of State directly and through Russian language. While the people are hungry, the president's shame in luxury and let himself build beautiful new palaces, that is. The conduct of the army, on the side of his sovereignty, will lead to corruption and oppression. Since he has been in his second position as a construction worker for 15 years with the very business of his masters, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egypters, such as the currently operating clicks.
After the first week of Sisis Griff had demonstrated thousands of opposition to his kingdom and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights defenders and opposition politicians, were arrested, calling Ali on this Friday a "Million March". That really was unlikely for so many people on the streets. But it came to a number of different small protests, such as in Giseh at Cairo and in the country of Kina at Luxor. Videos in social media showed that participants in Al-Sisi corruption were involved. In these protests, the police also had little influence on the streets.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators spent the last week banding with the president's office in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security checkpoints built in the city and on the streets. In Cairo several U-rail stations in the city were closed because of "containing works" which were blocked most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution in 2011. And on the Raba Square, which was destroyed by the Muslim mursi, until the army took them under fire, and up to 800 people were killed, a further measure was needed to prevent them from breaking down the wall.
Mohamed Ali made these preparations for a change in his tactics: "Our goal must not be the train station," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let us not meet with police officers." But as a retreat, it would not be understood: "With Egypt is the train station".
When the supplier promises too much performance
If the Internet connection is much slower than the provider, there are different possibilities.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to trust the provider's speed limit. Customers can check on occasions how much of this is actually achieved.
Finally, the pre-contracted transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be reached, explains the consumer central Bayern.
If the connection is much slower than the provider, there are different possibilities. Thus, the federal network agency (BnetzA) measuring the actual data transmission rates and compares them with the agreed rate.
"However, the tests carried out by suppliers are carried out according to specific requirements and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," said the consumer centre Bayerns on their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set an appropriate deadline for the provider in the rule 14 days to perform the promised performance. This is done in the best case by signing the entry.
If this does not happen even after multiple demands, customers can advertise and, under the circumstances, also demand damage. However, in the event of outstanding success, only the complaint will help.
First ranked Republican for research
As the first ranked Republicans, the Governor of Vermont has spoken against US President Donald Trump for an impeachment investigation. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from, it is determined by the facts, which will be established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistlelower affairs, before measures can be taken - an intervention procedure can be taken to appoint the President.
Scott said he was not surprised at the announcement that Trump repeatedly called upon Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the intervention of democratic president and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have continued to resort to trup with criticism because of the whistleblower charges; few have been able to recognize them. Scott's withdrawals are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already been opposed to Trump's policy, such as the closure of environmental protection laws and the enforcement of immigration laws.
Spider-Man remains in MCU: More Marvel film
It was a shock for all Spider-Man Fans: At the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel will be going separate ways in the future. Tom Hollands Spider-Man would then not be part of the "Avenger" University. It was completely unclear how it should go with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives a further closing third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The reports of several US media agree. Then the cinematography will be determined: In the United States, the film will run from 16 July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying, "I am glad that Spiderys will be continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studies are pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universities, since Sony is still working on his video version. You don't know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? It is true that Sony Marvel has made an offer. According to industry magazines, the company, which is also part of Marvel, would share 30 percent of the revenue coming from Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
So herzogin Meghan and Prince Harry in the "Suits" finals
After nine stamps, the series "Suits" was held in the United States between large finals. In the latter, there were many Happy Ends and also many Cameo exhibitions. Also, the Royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years, were assigned to a charming way of tripbut.
One way: Herzogin Meghan did not return to a final divorce as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the most memorable scenes with today's Herzogin show again. As soon as the moments of the divorced and happy old age with Mike or how they welcomed him after his death.
However, her husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" finals, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just called off the altar to marry his deceased Sheila (Rachiel Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a significant comment on his approach. If he has actually passed a spell, the alleged Harvey of the wedding will know only briefly: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Age: Baby and four other children drinking at a boat crash
At the center of a flight boat in the Aegean Sea, a baby and four other children are drowned. In total, seven people die in the accident, as the Greek coastal guard told us on Friday. Nationalities were still unclear.
The boat landed near the Greek island of Inouses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish Festival. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Now hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, 174 people from the United Nations refugee relief work (UNHCR) arrived on this route. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he would like to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleagues and the competent EU Commissioner, he wanted to "information on how the refugee situation is in Turkey," said Seahofer on Friday, and he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help deal with it.
A EU Commission speaker confirmed the planned trip of Seahofers on Friday with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castanner.
In Greece many migrants from Turkey continue to arrive unusually. Only 654 people on the Greek islands spent their day alone on Tuesday, it was taken by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkish deal work yet?
The growing numbers have raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey Agreement, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come illegally across Turkey to the Greek islands. In contrast, the EU wanted to remove any Syrian refugees from Turkey.
However, the processing of asylum items is only important because of personal shortcomings on Greek pages. At Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros, and Kos, almost 29 400 people are detained by the Ministry of Civil Protection. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people, 5200 migrants are currently under way.
Since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, so many have been reported by the state-run team.
Climate change: Hitze leads to more heart rate
Then, the climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change will be one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society for Cardiology. In particular, the heart-run system created high temperatures and high temperatures in a short time and led to increased heart rate. In particular, people with heart disease, older people and diabetics were affected.
Green politicians have to answer because of painful photopanes.
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election struggle - was this reason the bees manipulated?
The Canadian Green Chef holds a multiway beaver in the hand of a photo. But now came out: the bee was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It's been a very long time unmarked - and finally disappeared. The reusable coffee beers with metal stream has never been in the hands of Elizabeth May, the chief of Canadian greens. On the party's website they were to see a photo with this bee, in conversation with the citizens. However, the photo was already published and distributed to the media - and there was even more snow (paper) beers, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chef has to answer because of photopanes
The May National Post presented manipulation and that the Fake News party was producing more credible on the topic of "environmental protection". And that was in the middle of an election struggle for sub-home choice, in which Trudeau also had a growing difficulty because of a decision-making scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and the discussion about Face News was started. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their entrances."
May showed shocked and insisted on her blog, not knowing anything about this action. To emphasize this, she also posted the original: She, in conversation with the citizens, a becher in her hand. However, she was right to be from Bambus. She always had it. A speaker of the party said that it was just about going to take part in the picture, and not to translate something. From the photo it is just to see a section on the website.
May writes: "I don't want to call him stupid, but there's nothing to hide," she says to the guardand said at the same time, "If they're satisfied to edit a picture, they couldn't do anything with my face so I could look younger?"
The German Greens have also been shot because of their use of inland plastics or due to flights in Shitstorms - but their images were not photographed. As is the case, the chief of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, at the Eis holiday with plastic ceilings, such as brandur.de*.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathy
Assuming that Jaqueline Ng per mail from Cathy Pacific was granted an upgrade. But when she started checking it, she did not stay on board - and she should never fly with Cathy again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the Business Class - from which many airlines sleep. Sometimes they are happy, and the check-in staff offer a free change from the economy class.
However, this case shows how you should not do it: A self-explained influenceor has actively prayed for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and June 7.
On the flight, the Jaqueline staff refused an upgrade, although they had presented a mail, in which their Cathy Pacific apparently showed an upgrade. The letter wants to have the influence of a marketing worker at the airport. The Airline nevertheless accuses Jaqueline of having loved the mail.
On the return trip, Jaqueline tried to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman would have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The staff at the JFK airport were skeptical: they were at the center. And indeed, the employee from whom the mail was claimed had broken off the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airlines canceled Jaqueline's ticket and connected a life-long flight ban with Cathy Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about €1.280), they had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
In her case, the influenceor turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that lost the consumer's interest. Because Cathy had reimbursed the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also asked the costs for the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not complete the mail's metadata, the case remains clear: For Catay, the influencein has been charged, it remains closed for future flights. The business conditions of the airline also say that they do not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now activates an attorney.
Oil prices after reporting on the status of weapons in Yemen
The oil prices fell on Friday at a shorter time than a dollar. Last, a Barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea resort Brent 61.83 US dollars - around 1.4 percent less than before. The price for a Barrel of the American type West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
A report from the Wall Street Journal on a gun stand in Yemen was issued by the bus driver. Saudi Arabia is expected to have approved a gun stand in four areas.
An attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought about five per cent of the world's oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels associated with Iran in the Civil War, Yemen, had announced the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A state of armaments would create political tension in the region.
If an agreement really exists, you can focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the Department's raw materials strategy at the Saxo Bank of the news agency Bloomberg.
The oil prices continue to move in the past day. One week ago, a Barrel WTI oil had cost up to $59, Brent almost $65.
In the past, Bloomberg reported on Insider that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had occurred as soon as the attack occurred in mid-September. Consequently, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved again towards the original quantity.
Recently, there were several press reports on insiders who reported rapid progress of the state oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work. But raw materials experts point out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a flood of plans and negative hits.
At the same time, there was some tension in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stenna Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by the Iranian and the recently issued release on the way to leave the port. The possession is now ready for departure, while the ship is still in front of anchor, King Erik Hånell shared the Swedish roundfunk in a SMS on Friday morning.
However, the U.S. announced that the United States would be able to place shells and soldiers on the Iranian soil to Saudi Arabia. The fear of a scalation between the Islamic Republics and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had given the oil prices in the past few weeks had been significantly higher.
Threats to Trump
In the case of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, several leading government officials had tried hard to prevent access to the speech from being spoken. This was an anonymous indicator. The speaker of the representative's house, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, had preceded the White House by a strong telephone between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky at the end of July.
North Korea has a third drop of trup and Kim for question
North Korea has no doubt suggested that it will soon reach a third peak of Machthaber Kim Young-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and success of such a meeting were due to lack of progress in the implementation of the first summit agreements in Singapore, said Chief Diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday at the KCNA Agency.
The US had done nothing to implement the Gippel's decisions last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry's consultant said. He also criticised the strong US chances and the joint military forces over the United States and South Korea. But he hoped for a "how" and "maybe" decision Trips so that it would come to an approach again.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third peak meeting with Kim was going to do before he agreed to do so. The negotiations on a suspension of the North Korean nuclear and rocket program have been held since the two summits of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to continue the consultations until without great success.
Prince Harry: Gun manufacturers are supposed to help miners
The British Prince Harry in Angola, dressed with a blue splitter shield, is symbolic and destroyed. Nearly a camp of the British Halo Trusts at the place of Dirico, he placed the ring around here. In a safe distance, the explosive bodies exploded. In order to get Angola to 2025 free of charge, he later called on all the countries whose names were on these weapons, but not on the streets to help.

In view of a low interest rate, the fund is lost against the euro at value.
Frankfurt Speculations on a low interest rate in the Bank of England (BoE) are based on the Sterling Fund. The British currency was charged on Friday at 0.4 per cent to $1,2269.
The publishers of the sale were exaggerators of the note banker Michael Saunders. This led to a discussion, even if a Chaotic Brexit could be denied, as the insurance of the British conjunctory would be inexhaustible. These statements were surprising, since Saunders was the founder of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhouse ActiveTrades.
In the past week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the difficulties for the economy through Brexit Hickack without directly signaling a profit chain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants his country to lead its country without an EU education agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocation, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. However, it could be paid for him, according to Mr Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Show more Russian manipulations
The material from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the sole director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Leichtateletik World Federation.
At the launch of the Leichtateletik-WM, new details of the doping scandal in Russia appear - and they have reduced the credibility of what the Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and only a few more. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it appeared that they were caught.
In December 2014, a systematic meeting was held in Russian sports. The Wada had closed the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this period, Russian athletes were not fully bound by the World Cup. The International Olympic Committee had attended an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio around 270 athletes in the country under neutral flag, with 168 Russian athletes and athletes at the beginning of February 2018. At the World Cups in various sports, they were also able to be held in Russia in summer with the Fusssball-WM host.
A positive error occurred
The following September, the Wada reopened the Rusada-Ban, but requested access to the lab and the samples. The data should provide an overview of the extent of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes and athletes at night. Three months later they were finally delivered.
The President of the Independent Integration Commission (AIU) of the Lichtateletik World Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data has been manipulated from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Journal" of the Friday. "We have identified a number of discrepancies between the data that Wada received by a whistleblower and those that were received by the Russians in January". Many positive findings have been found in the McLaren report.
The WM does not concern
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Lichtateletik link is held as the only organization in the Bann Russia. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they were trained outside the Russian system and subjected to tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already taken place in the space and requested Russia to respond to the proposals within three weeks. Russia is now experiencing the new spree of Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the Olympics in 2020 in Tokyo.
