Republican strategy against the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justified their policy of combating electoral fraud.
However, in the Centre of Brennan it is considered to be the last myth, claiming that the cases of election counterfeiting in the United States are more rare than the cases of death from the beating of a bear.
At the same time, there were only 300 cases of electrical fraud in the United States for ten years.
One can say with confidence that these new trends will have a negative impact on the electoral role.
In this regard, such actions have been partially discriminating the American democracy system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why, since 2009, most Governments have adopted laws that make the process of registration or voting difficult.
This phenomenon was new after the elections in November 2010, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, only 180 draft laws limited the right to vote in 41 states were adopted in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require the elector to provide evidence of identity with the photograph and evidence of the existence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the elector on the day of the vote and take the right of vote to citizens with jurisdiction.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state had forced voters to submit their identity certificate with the photograph.
India became the first state to make such a claim.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law adopted in India in 2008.
The Republican authorities have speeded up this practice in other countries as well.
During the last two years, they have initiated legislative projects that require voters to submit identity certificates with the photograph in 34 countries.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity evidence such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, 21 million people who have reached the age of voting, do not have any evidence from the photograph issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters have no such document in 2012.
In this respect, the cost of obtaining the required identity certificate is often greater than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions affect youth, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens aged 65 and 20 per cent of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required person approval.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are considered to vote for candidates from democracies, are not allowed in a number of States to use a person's license with a photograph issued by their educational institute.
The same States therefore allow the members of the fishing and fishing clubs, which vote mainly for the Republicans, to use for the voting of the credentials issued by these clubs.
By 2004, no State had required evidence of American citizenship to vote.
The first such requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are a citizen of the United States.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the vote of the speakers from Latin America.
It is believed that two thirds of Latin American voters vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011 the Republican legislators introduced laws that prohibit the registration of voters on the day of vote in eight states.
They have also limited the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction has not gone unnoticed.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the electoral registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have resulted in 17 per cent reduction in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the current vote.
Thus, 33 per cent of the voters who voted recently in Florida during the 2008 general elections were Africans, although only 13 per cent of the country's total voters were elected.
The same was true of those who came from Latin America.
Only 11 per cent of the voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted in favour of the moment.
Unlike whites, which formed 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters voted in favour.
Of course, democratic legislators and their parties are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were welcomed by democratic Governors.
The most numerous laws have been suspended with the intervention of the Attorney-General of the United States.
This resulted in a partial limitation of negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring approval of the person with the photograph.
However, the new rules that have entered into force will inevitably make it difficult to exercise the electoral right of elections in 2012.
Democrat criticisms condemned the premise of the laws that had been adopted, with a clear focus on the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Centre of Brennan shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 out of 270 votes in favour of the electorate to win the presidential election.
It is too early to confirm that these legislative changes at the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the election of voters.
In this regard, such actions have been partially discriminating the American democracy system.
Screaming the hands of the front iron: whether to pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives false, false, and sometimes positive results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so unsatisfied, are more likely to be suspicious.
Whether to run a test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, numerous cases of injury were observed among the study groups, so the data obtained were difficult to interpret and difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different level of mortality among patients who had gone through screening and those who did not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasis was 30-40 per cent higher than those who did not pass the screening.
So I would recommend that the test begin 50 years or 40 if one of the immediate relatives had cancer.
African men of origin are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
The cancer can be aggressive and powerful.
A patient needs to explain the risk of his or her cancer by offering possible options, without the compulsory treatment of a free hand, which does not pose a risk to life in a long-term perspective, and the choice, in these cases, to the benefit of an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men with cancer will not undergo a course of treatment, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them an active observation, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
More and more, we clearly define criteria for deciding who should or should not have a course of treatment.
So, I would recommend that we go through the test anyway.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not this test is necessary.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember established an instrument to assess all of this and to counter the passing of the PSA test.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, monitoring of the health of life remains a better way of reducing the risk of disease.
It is believed that 30 per cent of cases of cancer could be prevented if all people were to eat well and move enough.
"If no one had smoked any more, this figure would have risen to at least 50%," stressed André Bolly, secretary of the Canadian Association of Cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cases of cancer are caused by inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
The surgery is associated with 85% of cases of mild hands.
And it's a risk factor for many others.
It is harmful to people’s health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said press secretary André Bolly.
The encouraging fact is that, 10 years after the quit of smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Other
According to KAR data, excretion and vomiting also contribute to the occurrence of disease.
They increase the risk of developing breast cancer, fat and direct fluid, food, pancreas, and breast cancer.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against the hand of a bagful,” adds the Association.
Question
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of the fresh meat.
Too much it increases the risk of developing the hand of a fatty fluid.
Coal products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by boiling, drying or salting may lead to the education of authorized substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the organism and lead to cancer," they explain in the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer.
At this point, however, the results of these studies cannot be described as identical.
In the view of SCC, vitamin E studies provide conflicting results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of cancer development, the other would be counterproductive.
The impact on the development of vitamin D is also not clear.
However, Mr. Bolyo stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family background with the doctor.
"The evidence of analysis does not lead to cancer."
Higgs bozo in detail
Last summer it was reported that scientists may have been able to detect Higgs' bomb, causing this food - and not without reason.
It is believed that this bomb causes the mass of all parts in the universe, not much.
In addition, this is the last part that was foretold in the Standard Model, our best or, in any case, the "at least imperfect" description of nature and the behavior of matter, but which had not previously been discovered by experience.
But physics is not yet convinced that this is about the Higgs bozo.
We know without any doubt that we are dealing with a really new part and that it strongly recalls the Himgs attack foretold by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical conference in Kyoto seems to confirm that some data is not yet fully available.
Let's imagine what's going on about the Higgs Bozo, as the chances of being mistaken are minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, a law that is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be seen in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to cover this rule, even if you don't try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
However, although the physical parts are quite strange, it is said that there is also one law of the same nature: the principle of Paul ' s exclusion, which asserts that two parts cannot take the same space at the same time if they live in the same "quantity" — that is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physics divides parts into two categories.
In one corner, we find well-ordered citizens called farmers who wisely adhere to Paul’s principle.
On the other hand, there are hundreds of bosses, angry gangs of anarchists who have no respect for at least that principle, which means that they can be at the same place at the same time.
As the site reports (indistinctly unaccompanied) Particle Adventure Laboratories of Berkeley, these bozons are divided, in turn, into two groups: the areas we are not talking about here, and the "Part of Powers", through which the main forces of nature are distributed and which are in some way related to the Hyggs game.
These greatest bozos should be emphasized, not all exotic substances, as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this Chronicle, it's due to one amazing banana game: a photo, or a light part, which is the "curror" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a part with an electric charge is speeding up or changing direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone broken into a bridge.
This "infrared" is caused by an electromagnetic wave (the light, or infrared discharge, or ultraviolet, etc.), and it is no other than a photon - and thus one of the “permanent forces”.
More stable field
The same is true with the Higgs bomb, with the only difference that in order for that bomb to occur, another field must be "damaged" in the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is a much more stable electromagnetic field; to build it, it needs to be achieved very and very high energy, as if it were about the inner edge of a very large stone.
That's why a huge acceleration is needed, like the one that is operating in CERN, the Great Adrone Collier, which is a 27-km diameter switch! - to achieve such enormous energy.
Analogues with the electromagnetic field were also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all parts and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, work together, others not: books, for example, will never be held in a refrigerator.
The same is true, not all parts interact with the Higgs field: those who interact have mass, while others (such as photons, kittens) do not have it.
So, what can all of these studies do, Mrs. Plamondon?
They are used in science to verify the integrity of the Standard Model (SM), and this also makes it possible for physics to distinguish between the results of the observation and the forecasts of the PM.
Moreover, some of them desperately wish that such a distinction would be discovered, i.e. minor discrepancies could open the door for "new physics" and close some of the doors of the Models.
Finally, it must be said that there are still significant shortcomings without any explanation for gravity (o!) or the dark matter that forms about 80 per cent of the universe (o!).
But no such distinctions were found in the CERN.
Effects
The benefits of these studies for the daily life of the average statistical person are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it does not.
Consider: At the beginning of the 60th century, the pioneers of laser studies in the Bella laboratories could not even imagine the revolution that would trigger their work.
They provided for their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960, who developed the first permanent laser (formerly impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was originally seen as a labyrinth.
Imagine...
In addition, the annex can be found for the accompanying study tool.
For example, the same William Boyle developed a small world sink in 1969 during his optical studies.
Although this was not his original purpose, he now serves as a "eye" for all digital camera world and earned the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adrone Collier is necessarily going to change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative help is the best way to die... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Commission had recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life in Quebec.
The debate must be resumed soon and the draft legislation is under way.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Long tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Monterezia.
The hand of a simple man who broke his inside gave him a two-year term.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in the welcome of the palliative treatment of Victor-Gadbua in Belgium, where the persecution was brought to an end.
"But it's always a shock, it can't be prepared," he says.
Disease does its work: an incredible weakness that does not allow itself to go to the toilet and even ask for it alone.
Sitting behind a table on which a dinner dinner is served, he is given and agreed to help him get some food.
He may even be tempted to smile, talk to strangers who are working around him, take medications, take him to the bathroom.
A man before normal death.
"My greatest desire is to get rid of the smoke, it's destructive," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this illness.
"They teach us that a man must stand," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbua's home.
Regress to the status of the child - for some unexplained degradation.
"All depends on man's ability" to deal with the fall, he says.
In the view of many people involved in palliative care, important events are taking place in the very midst of this incident.
Patients entering the palliative home of Victor Gadbua are all sick with cancer.
The forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing assistance, called “the cure”.
Ms. A., 89, is more afraid of dying in a sense of conscience.
But that’s why I got to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before she lets her a mask that makes it easier to breathe.
She still looks forward to the last few days of her son’s visit from Italy.
With the assistance of a group of volunteers, Victor-Gadbua is invited to provide body care and food assistance.
It's a palliative care that remains when there's nothing more to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec of every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place for palliative aid institutions.
It's very small, given that we're all going to die sooner or later.
This life continues under the best conditions that can be explained by Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors.
It's a physical, emotional or emotional comfort.
We're willing to give the dead man a piece of bread from the brandy or pepsi, as he's asking.
Diabetes, we no longer stop controlling the sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought Mr. H. who died tonight.
His son got this beer in his legs in a quiet place.
"We help our neighbors, as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care for the sick.
I don't look like a day before Victor-Gadbua.
A few 93-year-old, enjoying his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his knees during a toast in his honor, tragically killed a 36-year-old man, surrounded by parents, wife and two small children and trying everything to survive.
"In the last half of three to five years, cancer patients are always under the age of 45," said Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of the patients receiving Victor-Gadbua receive home and 47% of the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have died in the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or at home.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the High Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less in the care of cancer patients.
That is the great gap in Quebec's health system, which has caused many doctors, in terms of palliative care, to fear the adoption of a law that regulates ethanasia and helps in suicide.
Since October, it has been circulating a manifest signed by palliative care lights, Dr. Balfurm Mount and Dr. Bernard Leapuant, and evidence of their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health system is insufficient to ensure the right to a high-quality palliative treatment before it is allowed to move to Estonia.
Recently, she says, - I saw a patient who had spent 14 days in the emergency department, in terrible pain, and no one had taken the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have been trying to save patients, despite the psychiatry forecasts.
Hope for the survival of Ellen Richard has already been minimal when she has stopped disrupting chemotherapy.
When I told my uncle that I was stopping treatment, she told me that I'm sorry I'm ending the fight, she's telling me.
But she told me myself that my days were worth it!
There's no cure.
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who ask for death are grateful to the staff because they have not complied with their request after the paralytic treatment team has relieved them.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely effective in combating pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Community for palliative care at the home of the Greater Montreal, patients are not able to cope with 8 per cent of the cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often come to a palliative session where the patient is asleep until his death, either from time to time or from time to time.
We can't pretend that we don't know about these sufferings anymore.
More and more patients who are unable to ease the pain can have access to the palliative session.
Painful people always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get etanus," it means "I want it to be easier for me."
The creation of this report has been possible thanks to a journalistial grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies.
Large-scale wireless scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political party collectioners and Italian mafia specialists are told every day that they know about the colossal system, the building industry, public servants, policies, union workers and mafios.
India, which is very expensive to pay for Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
“It is a pity that this system is broken down after all the funds have been released, that Jacques Duscheno, the deputy and former chief of Montreal police.”
It was thanks to him in 2011 to the scandal as a result of the investigation of road-related criminal offences in Quebec, in which the Prime Minister of the time of Liberia, Jean-Share, agreed very harshly.
The Duschen report has established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the 2010 investigation, he stressed that only the Ministry of Transport would keep billions of dollars in contracts," if some had been holding their instincts to take a stand.
The Sharon Commission "has already met two masters", he adds, hoping that it will be able to "open the schemes that exist for individual persons".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was concluded in 2011 by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, consisting of a broad state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Molot Special Unit, who, after 2009, had set up Montreal ' s East Card, stopped increasing the value of contracts.
Over the past few weeks, a series of trials have been carried out, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Rissar Markot, the mayor of a small town, have been accused of fraud and corruption.
On the other hand, Jill Wayyankur, recently retired from Mary Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
It is suspected of being received several times when the public orders are placed.
In addition, a formal complaint was made by a number of engineers on the route of communication between Montreal and the construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akcurso and Lino Zambito.
The latest bombing of this bomb resulted in the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
In a few years, Zambito has given 3 per cent of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal, an intermediary related to the Mafia, who, in turn, has translated the money from Mary Gerald Trumble, the United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambito spent more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) on various provinces, mainly liberals then in power.
In addition, he recognized that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party of Natali Normando.
Sanitation contracts in which value has been increased
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked relentlessly.
Jill Surprenan, former civil construction engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: for ten years he received from the construction companies, invitations to travel, on golf tournaments, in restaurants, on hockey mats, and a total of $736,000 in exchange for the channelling contracts he earned.
Other officials responsible for road construction admitted that they had received more than 30-40 per cent of the salary, using false supplements.
Then one of the organizers of the Mary's party, Martin Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's cash flows.
Following these findings, Mr. Tramble withdrew in early November, undermining Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs to be killed in Montreal.
Mr. Rivier-de-Préri, in the eastern part of the island, opposed the sale of a 5 million-dollar municipal site and a... 1.6 million construction facility.
70 per cent of gross money in pre-election campaigns
She says that in a final investigation that will be launched, she “is looking for a point that will allow her to understand the functioning of a system that is moving with the muscles to stop the gangrene and identify the perpetrators.”
This process is characterized by a “healthful but positive” process.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own research team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
Like we're going home.
Regular.
Jacque Duscheno notes by his side that “the workers stole hundreds of millions of dollars” but is particularly concerned about the role of “choice officials who know about the scheme” but who are not involved in the machine.
Given that the share of cash in the funding of the electoral campaign in Quebec is 70 per cent, it is a joke: "I was told that it was just a reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit up to $100 to parties, but this does not change the situation: "If we don't limit the electoral costs, the money will be wasted in politics."
It calls for a full restructuring of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: “We cannot go down; we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality.”
If this story and the darkness on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duscheno invites those who are smiling to look at his own court...
"PsJ--not the Barcelona FC!"
In this season, you got an uncanny mix in the IP.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual knowledge, but may also be a new measurement of the GSP.
There's been a lot of games.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical staff also contributed much.
These factors keep me up to the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easy.
Everything in the football is going very fast.
But I'm not scared.
From the very beginning of the pre-school training centre in NIF in Clerfonte and until my arrival in St. Stephen, I have always made progress.
So you're taking advantage of the competition established by Carlo Angelotti...
This summer's not in the news to play at a very high level.
They also know that each training is very important.
This leads to the fact that a game like me wants to be at the level and to be at the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Angelotti has supported my position.
He's been helped by replacements like Claude McCalle, who played the same position as me.
Anchelotti - the owner of the situation?
Of course.
The Angelotti instills respect for all technical personnel.
Today, he has no equal in the First League and is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He had a lot of experience, and he won no titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big games.
I think he'll bring new Paris titles.
In January, I had an encouraging discussion with him.
Then I left the whole series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSJ season?
In the First League, Leon took us to the leader's place.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the League of Champions: we have effectively qualified to one eighth final.
What's the goal of the club in this tournament?
We're trying to go as far as possible.
It could be all gone.
We can say our words to the face with very good European teams.
We began to want to end first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take the lead in one eighth final.
Can the PSC be a first-class European club in a short-term perspective?
He's got a budget for this.
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win the title and strengthen its position on a long-term perspective.
That's not true today.
The PSC has financial resources to make this project real.
Don't take a title in the First League, like in the past season, will it be a big mistake?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to get this champion title.
In the past season, we were close to this.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the end first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 shots.
Normally, 79 shots assume the name of the champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it'll be all right.
Despite the fact that such powerful teams as Marcel, Leon and Bordo have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the power to win.
Don't you think the media are waiting too much for the PSI?
It's normal to expect a lot of us, taking into account how many games we've got and what games we've got.
We're totally ready for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home, and we all find ourselves critical, of course, that's a little disturbing.
We wonder what people are waiting for.
We will never be able to win every exit with account 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The command will be formed in time.
We have proved in the League of Champions that we can meet the challenges of modern times.
Look at Manchester Union, which has been unable to spend two weeks in one eight finals, even though they've spent a lot of money!
Taking into account the amounts entered, we presented you at 15 o'clock before the winter break.
It would be a distraction to our opponents and to the French champion.
Leon and Marcel, who had not been high in the past season, were "swifted" by this new PRSP.
This shows how attractive the First League is.
I hope that in May we can calm down and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The IPJ seems to be completely dependent on the movement of the gold of Ibrajimovic.
Well, what if they say there's some Golden Dependence?
It just means that Ibrahim was very successful and that he killed a lot of heads.
He came for this, and he proves that he's the star of the First League.
Where he played, he showed that he was a big game and a world-wide star.
In the group we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exclusive.
It encourages others to improve their game.
His Force, one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 from France?
Like a disappointment.
I was eager to learn in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma has prevented me from wasting a little time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out of there stronger.
Today I can play good election matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized in Sydney.
We drew lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didie Desham in the head of the Sons?
They're good for him.
He's got a good position in the election team to the world championship.
He's a hard trainer, he's close to the games and he's excited about winning.
How much was Loran Blan?
But I don't want to compare.
Blan reached his goal, he qualified us in Europe.
I hope that Didier Desham will bring the Sons to Brazil.
Is the good thing worth nothing (1-1), which was launched in Spain on 16 October?
This match has given us faith in it.
Everyone was fighting for everyone.
Before that, in Spain, there were no such mothers in my career.
Payment and sale without bank support - with Bitcoin
The full opposite of the current cash exchange based on the central banks that have been counted between the receiving parties by the commission collections on their processing.
In addition, as these technologies often do, the political vision is evident: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, created by Satoshi Nakomoto (pseudom), is a virtual currency (in dollar, euro ...) and a protected BitTorrent exchange protocol, which allows for the exchange of files between participants at one level.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousands of sites have been adopted as voluntary or as a means of payment.
The battle course reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before returning to approximately $10 today (the courses indicated on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing is special compared to the world ' s exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
He describes a battle as "the most successful virtual currency", "competitive with a dollar or a euro" and "like the usual currency".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currency, such as “credit” used for moving into a video game, which is performed in the game process or which can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitkin, all the networks are simultaneously owned by bookkeepers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mails, such as an e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus ensuring anonymousity.
The collection of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using the dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the accuracy of the transaction.
Thanks to the file contained, it may be possible to verify that the bits used in the transaction actually exist in a public account book sent across the network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It is through a mathematical task assigned to computers, which, as a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
It's about the expansion phase of the file, it's the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, a short and unique one.
The "Berut" computers have a new transaction and add a number to it, before it's "heat" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will receive a unique digital signature (very zero at first).
As soon as this number is found, other angles are easy to verify that it's right.
The transaction is thus presented in a non-responsiblely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the user wanted to pay twice as much money as the same, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed, and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
A computer that has solved the task gets 50 beats.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is divided regularly by half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of Bitcones in treatment is therefore limited to 21 million, but they divide into one million, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing by increasing the computational capacity.
The network's life has already passed out and down.
Bitcoin service sites have been attacked, and the battles have been stolen from the reserves.
"The deficit is not related to the protocol itself," says Pierre Nuasa, who recently launched Paymium, a real money-sharing company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But enough money is also lacking.
Major games, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such gifts.
The others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Wiczman Institute in Israel recently analyzed the account book and found that almost 80 per cent of the battlers were not in circulation.
Gigantic sales were announced in November.
"Three thousands of dollars have been exchanged," said John Holmkvist, who works in Coinabul, who is involved in the conversion of the Battleships to gold.
Pierre Nuasa, another author of this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is a credit card equivalent (in these moneys) or a wireless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is how the girl comes out.
The owner better controls his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simply in place for entrepreneurs who do not need to establish new devices or software.
It's enough to report the address that can be "photographed and identified" on the phone, explains Pierre Nuaza, confident that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to review hierarchy systems in the interests of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may become a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB intends to review the various risks that are now considered to be higher if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capia and Surobia).
NATO and the Americans must follow them at the end of 2014.
It was time for the Afghan army to return control over their territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just ours.
We suffered mainly in Afghanistan, which we considered to be terrorists.
And we, with 88 killed soldiers, and the wounded and the wounded.
Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from crystals who refuse the presence of a foreign army, as was done in the CSD.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, let them even join the Jihads, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tadji.
They are suffering, sometimes helping local rebels, but they will no longer be able to drive themselves further in the West.
The departure of the French troops from the Niger base, which I saw from the heights of the mining forests, thanks to the French credits, was in order.
The truckers and helicopters were able to reach Kabula without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will not attack Kabul .
The circumstances changed from the time of their continuous movement from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood due to the struggle between different groups.
They were then taken under the control of the country as their sort of release, return to security.
Afghan women were paid for the darkness of these crystals in which Al-Qaida took them, but their situation has not improved in our day.
The former Mojacahedes, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a position of subjection.
The main anti-Soviet personnel returned to power in 2001.
They have become State-owned dealers to resale them under the regime of returnees from Iran and Pakistan using large American sub-contracts.
Most of them did not fight, nor did they themselves fight.
People like I've heard in the village, even if the government is not from the floor.
Many young people want to get out of the way of those who enjoy American generosity: the flow of capital is significant.
Young people are free from war and its ideologies.
They lived in a modern world when they were expelled from Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; 5 million people, one fifth of the population are now in Kabul.
State schools in cities are filled with boys and girls.
The jobs of these young people who do not want to return to the blackouts of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders must be ensured.
All of them, including armed fighters, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soft operas that represent modern peace and that look everywhere.
There's an army right now.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
The old anti-Semitic commanders have already taken steps to restore provincial companies that would not be subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, the country of origin, with strong local differences, must be decentralised to a certain extent, in the form of Western countries, but the United States wanted to convert it into a centralised State with a strong presidential authority, eliminating the post of the Prime Minister, who had existed since the Constitution in 1964.
President Carzay did not want foreign control, particularly before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, beginning in the 1950s, and even earlier, is dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been placed on the legs, neither does any plane operate, nor does any ironing system be repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is done except fruit and fruit.
Priority given to private initiatives.
In a country that has been destroyed in the thirty years of war, public infrastructure should be monitored.
They have heard that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
It just made sense that the Western countries were there to control them.
Without energy to transform iron or copper into space, without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there are no useful explosives.
The Chinese have almost left the meds of Mes Ainak, allowing international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) to tear down a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest workers in the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which imports and exports are largely dependent, restore normal relations on a beautiful day.
The completion of the French military units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: for girls, for boys, the French language college, the French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "supply the heart and mind" and to carry out the impossible task of combining assistance with successive operations, the "military-citizens" service with the Ministry of Defence (Cicic) released in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in ten mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intensive involvement of local labour force, have helped to halt the rise: drought, floods, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and the increase in the landscape.
What do we keep in mind about ourselves, spending two billion euros on military expenditures?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very severe in these valleys, which are often over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Mission received ten written requests for small agricultural works coming from local communities in the province of Capri.
To escape the resurrections directed by foreign groups, which farmers want, as they told me, they need to provide them with a little non-military support that would be well controlled and direct.
Heavy species of the Egyptian Constitution
It's a new risk step by President Muhammad Mursey.
While Egypt was divided more than once on the issue of a constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it exceptional powers, it decided to play a wa-bank.
After all, he announced in the middle that the Central Assembly would vote on the final text on the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
For nearly two years, Egypt has relied on the provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only intensified the country ' s division.
In his view, the President insists on his "atocratic ship", continuing "to violate this word" and "to defend the right".
The camp of his followers was assured that it was a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum shall be held for fifteen days.
It is a very short time for Bratev to refuse to explain the article to the Egyptians.
This is also a way for the President to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while a lack of satisfaction prevails throughout the country.
Muhammad Morsey seems to be convinced that the Egyptians are voting positively, as he said in an interview with the American Sunday Times.
More than that, the call for a rapid vote comes to the Egyptian people: "If you vote for my text, or I leave myself in urgent powers", which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Central Assembly, most Muslims, voted for text yesterday.
Most liberals have not responded to challenges.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to express their views.
The same has been done by representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society.
In order to reach the required quo, 11 registered participants were promptly added yesterday morning.
Some very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is no wonder that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, however, have forgotten the fact that one of the few differences of day occurred around... time for prayer because some members of the committee felt that the time of the Congregation was wrong.
The text on which the vote was still taken yesterday is contained in articles 234.
Subject to universal attention, article 2 of the 1971 Constitution has finally remained an identical article, which states that “the principles of the Sheria are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would allow them to apply more strictly.
For Muslims, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their good will and respect for other participants in Egyptian society.
"Licemerie" is responsible for the liberals who see only the pearl.
Because they believe that the Constitution is based on other articles.
They indicate, in particular, article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the Sheriat.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pommie, this is a concern, i.e. "People who are called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can observe the nature of theocracy."
Many Liberians, in addition to the fact that the next director of this university, seems to be less moderate than at present.
"There is no specific religious intervention right now.
From this Constitution, we remain within civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not intellectuals, and some of them are educated in the French system" - Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledges that "the circle of article 220 may result in a non-exhaustiveness, as the terms used in it are derived from religious lexicalism.
This applies in particular to the "fix" [Islamic Court of Justice, see para.].
And in the future, there may be a question as to how competent civil judges are to make decisions on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticised as it gives the President of the Republic broad authority.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have significantly decreased compared to what they have been in the old regime.
Second, the authority of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will be carried out, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
There will also be no ban on civilians in military courts, despite the request of human rights protection associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they consider to be a loss of freedom.
Responsibilities are maintained, and refusal is prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and in particular for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles no longer mention the protection of women, emphasising Heba Moreef, from Human Rights Wotch.
In her statement, the only positive moment is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that was not reflected in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television yesterday, the manifests were planned today in the second half of the day.
The Heads of State will, in turn, proceed to the street on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists wait for the holy places, the Pup Earth and the sea from the desert
The Promised Land combines abundant Bible truths, modern comfort, and the origin of nature.
"AIF" has identified five of the most important reasons for Israel's arrival.
We Shall Walk in Our Integrity
They are about to cross the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is thought that all who enter this "cup" will fail to thank God.
And Galilee was the place of Jesus ’ miracle: turning water into wine, drinking water, and wells of wells, and filling up nets.
There Jesus appeared to the disciples, and after he had been raised from the dead, he became their friend.
But most of the saints in Jerusalem.
Believers here are on the Path of Scorpion, or the Path of the Cross of Jesus.
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoriaum, where the court was held, and on the streets of the Old City, it leads to the Lord's tomb on Mount Golgophe - to the place of the Raspitia, the Mount of the Anointed and the tomb of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pop of the Earth, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The temple of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be elevated to a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree was grown from which Jesus was baptized.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews — the State of Placa, leaving the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people leave here a note with the wishes that they then perform.
Perform a vertical walk
The ruins of Masada's fortress remain a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on steep slopes in the mountains above 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who get involved in alpineism can get along with it.
The rest of the historical surface is supplied on the canadian road.
And north of the country is 1600-2040 m, with a famous Hermon mountain resort, which, in winter months, has a huge impact on tourists.
He's got a bus-shalt on top of the mountain.
The total length of the mountain track is 45 km.
At the top of the mountain, the cherubs lived in the presence of language gods.
Visit Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You're not going on a trip.
But even though five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesseta (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or fragments of the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Jewish wilderness, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
I'm coming to the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition there was a wide range of semi-pressionists and expressives from Mone, Pissarro, Renuara, Sezanna, Sisleja, Matissa, Modiliani, Shagala, Picasso.
In Akko there can be a museum of Al Bash, representing several halls of old Turkish baths with visitors and banquets of the time.
In Caesarea, you must enter a unique part of the Ralley Museum, where you can love Dalli and Rodena cultures.
There's no tour guides and subterranean lobes.
Access is free, but donations are not categorically accepted.
Fifth, the Holocaust Museum or the Yellow Way in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part - the child's memory - is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You're going into it - and you're in absolute darkness.
They're killing the stars.
And the names of the children of the Jews and the names of the countries in which they have been killed are known.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healthy
The three main short zones of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red and the Dead Sea.
Each of them has a pool, aqua park, dolphins, and oceanariums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea, even in winter months, the water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air is rising to 23 degrees [23 ° C].
The Dead Sea is hotter, and it's been bought for a year.
In fact, this most unmanned sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below the ocean level.
The lake’s water in it is a well that is easy to hold on to even those who do not even know how to swim.
The landscape around is really pretty.
They eat here to go through treatment with salt water - rabies and fungi, and treat the health of dermatites, allergic, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchits, sugar diaphragms, to treat dementia.
Frustrated to the Secrets of Oldness
The oldest part of Tel Aviv is the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
It was followed by a famous sea route that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
Noah built his ark, and the Persians rescued the beautiful Andromeda, where they lived for a long and happy life.
Tourists love to sail on the narrow shores called Zodiac’s signs.
They say, if you move to the walls on the street of your sign, Fortuna will be very kind.
You can meet young people from all over Israel in Jaffo and even other countries at the photo session.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - it can be traced to the Roman theater, "take" the courage of the Christians.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The refurbished theater is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Synchronising folder
When sent to Israel, don't worry about their imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population know Russian.
Money on travel is better to spend not in euro but in dollars that are easy to exchange on bicycles (now $1,3.8).
Urban transport is a major bus, but Jerusalem has a speedy tram, and in Haifa is the only metro-line country that consists of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
In fact, it's a underground funnel.
The journey in all types of urban transport is 6 bicycles, which can be built with a lift for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath was marked.
From Friday evenings to sunset on Saturday, they stop their work on the market, shops, public transport.
A working week begins in the morning.
In many coffees, restaurants and hotels, only fresh food, excluding pigs, sea products, fish without cheese and meat containing milk and meat.
It offers a large selection of balconies and beef, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, different sauces, sweets from young nuts, falsifiers, fruit and fruit.
There are no ships in the streets of the cities of Israel.
That's why a lot of decoy cats are really "play themselves."
You can see them sleeping at night even on the roofs of the car park.
Morticians love human places and don't give up on healings.
The rental of the car, depending on the brand, is estimated at $37 per hour (Hyundai Gettz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And the train's wings are washed in 15-chicks a day.
The car in the museum is about 30 miles [30 km] away.
Language Cipher
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from all over the world.
More than anything to travel and breathe came from US citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
There were 118.8 000 Ukrainian tourists in the Occupied Land from January to October 2012, with 51 per cent more than the 2010 equivalent, before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Powerful" will bring to Moscow: migrants copy money into language
As long as MPs and human rights defenders argue that the law on compulsory language testing has already appeared in the country with lipo certificates
Each year, in Moscow, Petersburg, and other cities of Russia, there are 13 million guesthouses.
Most of it is Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their sole goal is to earn money to support families remaining in the family.
Since 1 December, the law has entered into force on which every migrant is obliged to conduct an examination of the language of the Russian language.
As long as this rule applies only to those who are intended to work in the field of services, housing, housing and trade.
However, with the time promised in the IMF, tests will be mandatory for all arrivals.
This includes not only language but also Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must also be confirmed in order to obtain and extend the permit to work.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russia is a State language.
The law does not fall within the scope of the law and the people who have succeeded in obtaining academia and diplomas for education until the fall of the SCR in 1991.
Benefits, calculation and protection of rights
The review points network will work under the auspices of the Russian-language Institute for the Name of Puskin, the University of People ' s Association, the IGU, the GSP and other Russian-language trains.
The testing of migrants could be carried out in all cities; more than 160 such centres have now been opened in Russia.
The testing initiative was also supported by the Lord's Members and the IMF.
And these human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have been able to ask the press a question: what is that, of course, enough?
What will change the obligation to know the language and to the Russians and to the visitors themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service are responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
A great many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the Russian Federation Mission in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized collection system will allow 90 per cent to address foreign workers.
Problems arise in migrants without professional education, non-language education without medical training.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev, a future migrant is about to meet people who, with the help of him, take a "path" into a cold tight bar, where he and his dozens will be covered for months without food and documents, which will take 12-14 hours in the morning.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They promise their families one thing, and when they come, they deceive them, they choose passports, they do not pay the promised payment," confirmed the head of the head of the MIC's labour migration management, Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't move, soldier!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who are working in Russia recognize not only that they do not know the language of the country in which they are working but also that they are working on their own.
Of course, it is not as much their fault as it is, but few Turkmen, Uzbeks, and Tays can even obtain such basic education.
They have nothing even to feed their children, not talking about wearing them properly, cooking and cooking at school.
As children grow older, they are sent to work at the same time.
It's hard, if they know the language, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and worthless."
True, the law on the language of human rights defenders marks one important moment.
The testing will be carried out only for migrants who have legal status.
However, if the status does not exist, there will be no examinations or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, a large majority of the gas tankers still live illegally in Russia.
"I'm good to apologize, or the Postside entrance is banned."
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not that simple.
The reason is in bureaucratic arguments and all the same language difficulties.
Moreover, legislation is money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And this false registration can be made quickly and more than a thousand dollars.
Russian police officers know that we have mainly false documents, no registration, leave and demand cases.
"Six hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," was shared with journalists from Tajikistan's citizen Umed Huschadamov.
"Come on, don't pick it up, buy it alive."
On the first day of entry into force of the language law, it was found that false documents were not only immigration documents.
Several "floating" certificates for the passing of language tests have already been issued by FMS staff.
The separate books are printed on a common color printer.
Of course, they have reached new owners without delay: each of the migrants who had hoped to facilitate their pass of tests paid for a document of seven thousand rubles.
This is twice the risk of official testing: it is intended for a worker in three thousand.
The main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "steps" cannot simply be bought, matched by government representatives and human rights defenders.
Until the authorities can make a promise to the waiters who have not been able to pass the test for the first time, it is time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian visitors will be offered work in areas that do not expect active society with people.
VAT does not involve trafficking in illegal arms markets
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is very small
Russia's TIR proposes to enforce the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: to find shots at the weddings when there were no victims, and the fight by Moscow's lawyer Dmitry Vinograd, resulting in seven people being killed.
The police want to prohibit trafficking in public places and increase the age from which to obtain a licence for arms from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the thought committee on security and anti-corruption of Irina Yarovya and promised that amendments to the arms law would be made to the Lord in the near future.
Not all is enough for the Russian authorities to try to fight the problem by closing the window.
An open letter was published on the network, which was written by the representatives of various public minority organizations, demanding that they refrain from “unreasonable abuse”.
The percentage of seizures with registered weapons is minimal, the Russian Bi-bi-si juridical criminalist Vassali Lesnikov has been reported.
According to ICT statistics, 142 crimes were committed in six months in 2012 with the use of firearms registered in internal affairs, while 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the violation of the legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not lead the criminal to enter the black market.
Now, they say, in Moscow, you can find any weapon at a low price.
At the same time, the MDGs claim that they control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from establishments to officers
The black arms market is filled with several channels.
The main five of these channels are described by Colonel Victor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Geneva.
The website that accepts arms orders
The first is “Armian or military sequence”, it is a weapon that was stolen during the war in Kazakhstan.
"Maranez" says the Russian officials, and the cassettes themselves.
The following kind of black weapon is stolen by criminals in the presence of powerful structures.
Baranez explains that there are also police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement personnel.
The illegal pillars are sold out of military stocks.
In many military camps, explosions have often occurred.
"There are evidence that some of the subjugations have been made especially - to cover the lack," said the former soldier.
The Baranca says that the arms manufacturers are introducing their flag.
"Irregular arms races are now being produced, which do not withstand competition on the international market and emit weapons from the field under the black market, including Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of the black market is a counter-Branch.
There is a great deal of progress in the arms and cars of poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There's its production, sometimes it's artificial, and there's a mafia that's organized a stream," explained the former soldier.
Where's the gun?
Experts considered what a close proportion of each source of illicit arms supply to the black market.
This report was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Planning.
Specialists analysed the reporting of ICT and Rosstat, criminal literature and open arms portals.
The underlying part of illegal weapons is written by the researchers, from the army and from the authorities.
Half of all the weapons on the black market were “on behalf of the officers whose work is related to weapons”, says the report.
According to the researchers, 17 per cent of armed conflicts occur from the scene, 14 per cent occur at the arms production stage, and 5 per cent occur in the "black archeology".
A salesman of one of the weapons stores who has asked not to call his name is convinced that the weapons found by black buyers have not been bought - too old.
Most of all, he says, salesmen go to the military storage for a new party.
Because of the propeller, a man buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
And they write it down, and they pass it by the backbone.
"He's taking her to the city and selling 900 euros for a piece with two stores," he says
“Justice, the police at the course of all cases, therefore, when the crime-discovery plan is set up, carries out control of the purchase of illegal weapons to traders,” the consultant adds.
"As in the pink shop"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through the brands.
I looked at the website, in blogs, until the friend who offered to come to the "Jehovah" platform, where the person who brought me into the "hoglock", where we're going to trade.
I only knew the price there.
Military observatory Victor Baranez
In order to get me a brand that's out there, a salesman tells me that I have a brand, but I don't believe it.
There are salesmen on the market, but there is also a need to come, provided that "from Ivan Ivanovic, who asked for a transfer that had been in his daughter's teeth."
I'm even getting a couple of castles now through a man who's convinced.
He's also giving them to me because he knows I'm not giving it to him.
They're looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranez tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing for the publication of the article.
The schematics, he says, have not changed.
They gave him an album with photos where everything was "all right."
"I felt like a pink store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, Baranca, says they don't offer the cat in the bag - it's all possible to try.
I'm a potential client, not just buying - we're eating with a salesman in the forest, we're putting a mouse there.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm convinced that weapons are good, we're starting to trade," the expert describes the procedure.
Stainless steel
The search for the Internet is conducted by websites and groups in the Contact, where they propose to purchase weapons for various purposes.
There is no need for documents and personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," says a newspaper headline on "Buy a gun or a car".
Its users leave their applications and ask questions.
What about the sale of minors?
"No licenses at all," asks the user Ivan (stained urgraph).
"The TT Moscow Cup" literally forms the "Fedorenkov" request.
The Federal Security Service has now broken down a huge network of websites and wants to buy weapons of war.
People go like the hungry fish on the beach and then get to Siberia
Military suspect and former military commander Victor Baranez
I have heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside Russian legislation.
People take orders.
The buyer is making payments through the bank.
"In response, they send a photo and instruction where weapons are directed," the press secretary of the public organization Dmitry Kisol explains.
Victor Baranez claims that by leaving the application on the site, you can remain unarmed and unskilled.
The Federal Security Service has now broken down a huge network of websites and wants to buy weapons of war.
"People go like the hungry fish on the shore, then they get to Siberia corner," he says.
100-dollar macros
The purchase of illegal small arms, according to experts, may amount to $100 to 900.
According to Dmitria Kislova from the weapons right organization, the Makarova gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month is coming.
It is derived from long-term storage stocks through the management of these medium-term stocks.
According to the official Bureau statistics, compared to January-October 2011, the number of crimes committed in general in Russia decreased by 7 per cent and by 22.9 per cent and the number of reported cases of trafficking and use of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the supermarkets
The MacDonalds cassette is running up to four of all American adolescents.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in the universal corporation of Walmart and the restaurants of popular fast food networks, such as MacDonalds, Burger King, Tako Bell, Wandes and Kentukki Fred Chicken.
Until no one is able to predict whether this wave will turn into a nine-year-old, or it will be destined to appear in early stages.
The shares support trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to increasing the low wages received by a number of Walmart workers and fast food systems, the aim of the protestors is to create union organizations.
Until this economic sector is virtually not covered by a trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The actions began last week, after a day of thanks, in the so-called Black Friday, when in America there was an outbreak of street sales, involving millions of people and sometimes accompanied by riots.
On that day, some of the staff of the Walmart corporation, with 2.2 million people working worldwide, left their jobs and piketed together with the trade unions and the left activists of the corporation, whose goods were considered to be modest and medium-sized.
Walmart is selling all over the world, from chicken, hot roses and car batteries to powders, eggs and milk.
The products in his shops range from 8 per cent to 27 per cent more than in large supermarkets.
As a result, many underpaid Walmart workers are given work to do.
The availability and association of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart may have allowed himself to sell the goods of interest partly because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about the difficult working conditions, such as the lack of drivers or manual scanners.
The participants in the Black Friday action requested an increase in pay and noted that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation amounted to US$ 30 to 100 per month.
The typical walmart employee, who received $9.5 an hour, said it wasn't for the carnage.
Scientists at the University of California in Berlin have shown that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, this would amount to $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% more than she spends on pay now.
If Walmart overspends on the buyers' wages, each visit to the store will take 46 cents to cover all of them.
They're going to spend $12.39 a year more than now.
The Walmart parties are pleased to note that protests have taken place in nine states and have not caused corruption or minor damage.
The Black Friday continued in its shops from 8 o'clock in the evening until midnight the next day, while Walmart sold about 5,000 goods per second.
In general, its cassettes produced nearly 100 million transactions in the Black Friday.
The representative of the corporation, Dan Fögelman, admitted on the left-hand side of the Huffington Post, that the workplace had left a total of five Walmart employees, and that the protest was the whole "regular pirate train" of its professional union.
"Free cash!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not the universal Walmart (they are not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore they are still not here) and the MacDonalds and other local restaurants.
McDonalds says he's selling billions of hearts, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals or pay you for your honest work!
Jimine Williams, member of the New York
At this time, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurant with time increases, but is not enough, and the average number of workers in New York is $8.90 an hour.
At least they don't need anyone in this town.
How can you live in New York for money like that? We can't make it for me.
Some time after the MacDonalds, almost four American adults who had been trained after school lived with their parents.
Few have seen this basic source of food or planned to stay there longer.
Now I am constantly talking to the MacDonalds workers who complain that they should live on this pay and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal, a comment is made by the author that it is not appropriate to bring up children if you do not know what to wear.
The participants in the protest campaign, which began on Thursday, 6.30 a.m. at MacDonalds, 40th Street and Madison Avenue, requested that the cashiers and the fast-food system be paid at least $15 per hour, more than doubled their current minimum wage.
They also requested that trade unions be established in the area of fast food.
The U.S. Act prohibits administration from prohibiting and penalizing activists of union movements with seizures and exemptions.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
However, it is difficult for a professional union to cover fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main factors is the unaccompanied current of staff.
Inconsistencies
Smuggling protests took place on that day and in a number of other restaurants in Manhattan.
The movement of action took place in the middle of the day of the migrating in MacDonalds, near the Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, in particular a member of the Georgian community, Jimine Williams, who said, "Macdonalds," said he was selling billions of dollars, and then he didn't even give you hospitals and pay you for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also supported the other seen New York Democrats, for example, the mayor of Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we must engage in the support of fast food workers in order to obtain fair wages and economic benefits that each New Yorker deserves!".
As the New York Times described, it was the biggest act of this kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, and not all of them were workers of a rapid public order in New York City, where tens of thousands were employed.
Until it's not clear, it's gonna give birth to a blast of mass movement.
"The peace of mind is in the middle."
The topic of added reality was recently adopted by modern-day worshipers, mainly through the use of special shocks.
At its annual conference, the current model showed Google early in the summer, and in November it became known that the application to the relevant patent was made by Microsoft.
However, the discussion with the leader of the 3D interactive group of technologies in the Cambridge laboratory, Microsoft Sharam Iziddi, should have been a step forward for the researchers of this company.
They have a vision of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with large hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general terms, what is your research group doing?
- We are engaged in human interaction with machines, but we are trying to break the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as mankind in the mass stopped at the stage of work with pixels on a flat screen, they sometimes fell into their hands.
We would like to look at 5-10 years ago and warn of the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost one Xbox is not sold today without Kinect, because it's all very serious.
- What else is waiting for us?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has taken over physical interaction, it is often on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system has received more data), and the conclusion has not yet been much.
We are trying to change this, working on a truly three-metre picture system based on different technologies, including projectives.
We need to release a computer world into our, physically, to make it more attractive.
To do so, however, we need to identify not only the user but also the area around it.
Then we can add real peace to virtual objects in a much more comfortable way.
And first of all, these stupid ones of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the voter?
A popular piece, but don't they overestimate it?
- He certainly cannot be called a panacea - it is a matter of privacy because he does not always want to report on his actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers is good, but everyone's down.
For example, we had a project that we thought about, not about, but about, but about, these expensive, expensive devices in public places.
The heat was recorded, not by the camera, but by the handbrush, which fixed the movement of bones and muscles.
As long as he's big, but theoretically, he can be reduced to the size of his hands.
But the future is generally behind mixed management, for example, harsh+vote.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to hand over this gas station to you?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- Is that what you want to force users to adapt to what you can or cannot do at this moment?
- It's not mandatory, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future, we must focus on developing new types of sensors that will allow for a more precise definition of human reactions.
This may be, for example, laser sensors, they're giving a little bit of a deep-sea, that's very important.
- If you're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what's your claim to a modern camera?
Don't you get permission, deep or something?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be separated from our work over the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixel 8 at 1000 k/s.
But it's not in megapixels, it's like matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technology is not good enough for us -- it adds work to the projectors' algorithms.
It should be remembered not only about the X and Y license, but also about Z.
It's also very important speed, the number of staff in the second.
The human movement is dynamic enough, and the current 30 k/s is extremely small, especially for the forces.
Steven Betisses from our Radmond Laboratory made a regular treatment sensor, from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not all understand how this affects human interaction with machines.
I would agree very much with the equivalent of such a device, not just demanding matters, so that the staff in the second would be better.
- And the number of cameras doesn't need to be increased?
- In Kinect there are now three cameras, one of which is the infrafractional extractor, and the other one is the receiver of the reflected signal.
And here's the third camera, of course, the normal sensor of the visible diaphragm.
It shall not be used to determine the depth of the object.
A potential higher number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required amount of bills.
It would be easy to create a flexible Kinect analogue, to play with the critical room and see how this would help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- How much I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his eyes to the audience.
Don't you think that as a result of the daily use of the technology of the extra-characteristry, is this one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, always solving, keeping the smartphone in the upper arms is not very convenient, but this is what I think: the worst option would be the "transparent" extra reality, when you could switch off the buttons on the smartphone, the projection display and the next exit.
Eye is a very personal device, in which their power (private things you see only) and at the same time weakness - additional reality on the basis of shocks will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's assume for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from the Green Man, but also a simple death.
There is one problem that often indicates criticism of such an idea: there is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my lessons, I often say that the added reality is the seventh in terms of interruption in human interaction with the machine.
I think eight can be added to your feelings.
Until then, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a fitting representation.
She's a great record of harassment!
But there are technologies that are actually aimed at providing these "air cardboards" -- for example, the interference of several ultrasound lights at a certain point where the palace is located, gives you a sense, but it's very weak - as if you were on the floor.
There are also toys that affect the nerve endings in your arms - also a perspective.
- Did you try to deceive the brain?
Let him think that he feels what he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried to do that yet.
Here is another challenge that must be more long - how to place a man in a very limited space, to believe that he is going on an open, practically endless, working and on the concept of escape roads (not all of them in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge shelves.
As long as the brain is mixed up, the work is still very much for many years.
This is what makes the virtual reality so attractive to the student is a lot of things in the absolute beginning.
Art instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the Peterburg Wanggard project on urban areas that are ahead, in the Avangarde of culture and art.
This list has already fallen to the light of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements are outside the city, often with recognition in Europe, with universal knowledge.
The new "Rosbalta" hero is archaeologist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirilla Miller, a man of war, dressed in all the beauty that meets at the Russian Museum, a summer garden, a fashion shop and a return.
Kirilla Miller's cards are always collecting a bunch of spectators where they don't show up.
Quiril Miller is one of the most famous Petersburg socio-physics, the founder of new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a bright man of the Petersburg adventure at the end of the '80s, the beginning of the '90s.
In addition, he was a city man who appeared on the streets of a city that raised all its foundations.
He recently took a charm and became a peterburgic charmer, as he set for this complex role all his divine existence, philosophy, and imagination.
- Quirill, why are you still walking around the city in all the beautiful, not in the heat or the bus, for example?
- I've chosen a beautiful color as a model that works in the form and image.
In this world, a beautiful color is a compromise between the artist, the immigmaire and the society.
Although in society everything is not really serious, it is a source of aggression and incitement to a bad personality.
But my provocations are about to start a conversation.
All the history of my provocational actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you should be an artist?
- On the show in the German DC, where my work has been shown.
I realized it was my way.
Then a wave of old free-form non-formal artists passed, and the new, free-types of me were inseparable.
I started to associate with the artists with a new wave, with a post-gazoning wave that led to the Poskinian-10, and there was no more.
I'm in the theater, clothes, music, in all genders, except for words.
And it all worked out in your Art Clinic... and it was important for me to stay at the center of Peterburg culture, where all the best creative powers should be collected.
In 1995, I took up the territory in Puskino-10, and there was a music-artist club, a divine club, a peterburg goddess's house.
Many were born there: NOME, Tequila-Jaz, I remember how Shura brought along with the project "Oho Van Goga".
Snow and his friends were singing light songs under the fan, they were in a long trick, among them being the modern composer of Igor Vdodin.
When the team played life, she became Leningrad.
Tratenberg was the lead of many programs to the Galway Times.
We gave them Tratenberg and went to his great career, and he got basic education and education.
The "D 137" gallery, the "Griboed" club, is an art clinic.
This is where our workers and everyone went.
I'm a hero of yesterday when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in press, the prize was "People of Our City."
In the name "The Year of God", I was named, and I ended up with my culture.
In the new times of old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, it can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your job is the best way to find out.
- Many of my paintings are hives, and they have a very well-expressed reality and severity.
I'll have a program exhibition, the Russian Museum in clones.
Cloon is an interim category.
I used to be social, and now being like this is painful and terrible.
But in the clones everything is mixed, the traffic is stopped.
I love gratis, I have gratis ideas.
For example, the preservation of peace through the introductory transition.
Now they meet on the clothes, focusing on the outside machine, not the inside person.
And maybe he can't give his hand and he can't swim in the spring.
And the lie will be removed with the help of the transfer.
- And we've seen you in the role of the city's charming.
They'll be like me.
- Well, can commercial art be beautiful?
- Commercial art must now be accurate, tactical, sweet.
It's going to disintegrate culture.
People used to get into the room, the gods loved each other, the forgiveness of each other.
Now everything is broken down into a micro-society, and it's hard for everyone to enjoy.
I'm not a hundred bucks for everyone to enjoy.
Now you need to think about who you're going to like.
Now there are 100 worshipers in every cultural hero.
- And Stas Michelova's coming for a few thousand!
- He's got a brochure, where the sex-social area works.
And at the cultural level, 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and in the end, less manager, money, everyone will be hungry.
And I have worshipers, that they should not deceive, that they should not be profited.
In my youth, I wrote pictures such that one collector had them on the wall with Falcon and Larion.
I started with a picture that usually ends.
Now they're often on their way to understanding.
They say: a culture of spirituality, a culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I was a man of culture yesterday, grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who gave up money for painting.
I'm behind this culture.
- Kirill, why don't you catch Peterburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this idea: a citizen of culture.
But not every one of them can be involved in a culture.
In the case of the right kings, the kings may not have understood very well in culture, but they realized that they needed to keep the right experts.
There are now good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're busy, as they need higher experts, who can properly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
Now, it's a taster.
The same is true of Eritrea, but it is different from what they honestly say that we do not accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, much more in Moscow's culture, there's soil.
And it's hard to grow on our rocks.
We need a cultural landscape, and we have writers now more than readers, it's wrong.
There's a lot of people in Europe who're going to show, concerts.
We've got this salt layer.
We need to make a fashionable experience, as it was in the beginning of the century.
Project implemented by Saint Petersburg
Born in Space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or contact with asteroid killer.
Cared spaceships with land on board are sent to search for a safe planet.
In order to preserve humanity, what is the main question of how to continue in a state of ignorance or on the same planet?
I think it's a little choice.
In fact, only two of these planets can be conquered despite hypothetical.
“It is Venera and Mars,” said the senior scientist of the State Institute for Astronomy, P.K. Sternberg (GAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the surface of Venus is a temperature of 500 degrees.
It's possible to live only on a large height or on the Venery Orbit... in space.
Reproductive problems in space began with flowers.
More than half of them have been experimenting with plants.
Four generations of the city's orbit were not different from their earthly species.
Then it's the release on the orbit of tiny, tiny fruit-drozophils.
In 1979, an egg was sent to space to check how the embryo develops in the form of a nostalgia.
We get to the exit of an absolutely normal bird.
And there's still a problem.
"The problem that this bird has to find out is that it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," explained RAN Vladimir Schičev, a leading laboratory of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP).
Not finding a cure, the birds were inseparably clumsy.
And after 10 hours, there was a complete atrophi of instincts in the newborns.
Birds didn't respond to light and sound.
And the accident was that they just died in the fourth morning.
"Two times we picked up birds, then refused, because it was just impossible to work with them," says a bird expert in the Vladimir Schičev space.
With the animal's last biological "miniquech" flying on orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments continued.
However, there will be only one person on Bion's biosputer.
It was an experiment with cross-sections that had already been sent to space with fruit.
In principle, they found nothing supernatural there.
"That's just as it was on biosputers, but again it's a single experiment, and such studies have to be carried out," says Vladimir Schichev.
After landing in the outer regions, the offspring appeared.
However, the problem of proliferation is not directly in space until it is found.
It's not a simple task.
Animals, land, natural habitats, simply cannot achieve their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike a beast, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has an abstract idea and is able to create a similar emotional background.
In ethical terms, such experiments are not carried out.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tresque.
And the most precious thing about humanity is that it's a woman's body.
Our Chayka was flying, and no one on Earth could say if he'd stay after the flight to space.
Can she give birth to a child after this flight?
"No one answered that question," said a veteran rocket and space industry in Washington, D.C.
In June 1964, a year after flight to space, the first woman to cosmonaut Valentina Tereskova had a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman, Svetlana Savičko, who attended the Orbits and even worked in an open space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have a small unit of spacecraft, which has all been created after long flights and has a healthy generation.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," the result of the spacecraft, the Soviet Union, the Russians, Valerius Polakov.
Nevertheless, mankind needs to look for new ways to biotechnology, to protect from radiation, to create artificial gravity.
The CPC hydrolaborator is a mandatory flight training phase.
In this context, the spacecraft are working in the open space.
Water imitates invisibility.
If for adult water, open and comfortable, but still strange environment, for pregnant children is a natural nature.
The small islanders confirm that life on the coast is coming out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is around 9 months in the mother’s fertility, which makes it easier for her to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical because from the time of birth, from the time of the first purchase, it takes two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," says the director of the sternline of Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if there is a more natural situation for the child born, women need gravity, gravity.
As soon as they are in darkness, the muscles of life, the tasa, fall into the capacity to disintegrate fruit.
All right, let's waste it, depending on the incentives of nature.
It may, of course, go to a special room, and it will throw it away.
"What else?" asked Valerie Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artistic gravitation.
Without the earth's pressure, the body does not form a skeleton and a muscle system.
It is not possible to wear a special load suit for training as an adult.
He'll just forget that he'll need it alive.
"And this experiment that we're going to go with you, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to the land of a completely detached person," the leader of the IMBP Bioethics Committee, RAN Igor Pestov.
Until children are born in space is a question of theory.
However, this will soon be a reality when land on their ships moves to a distant planet that will become a home for their offspring born in space.
Chief Auditor General: Check of the Swartz System was broken by policy.
The Czech public procurement sector has good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, remains in use.
This statement is Miroslava Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control and Audit Administration, from an interview to the website Aktualná.cz.
"The law will never be ideal, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we do not understand," Kala commented.
Such conclusions provide a joint inspection of Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of the wrong practice, Peter Necessa's approach to the so-called swart system is the wrong one.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Citizen Democratic Party) would not worry about verifications - is it prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be in some way established, and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the institutions that are responsible for verifying and fulfilling obligations,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the State procurement legislation of both countries.
What exactly did she say?
There's a parallel check we started two years ago.
In other words, the fact that European legislation affirms how public procurement should be carried out remains a national law and then the application of practice.
All the information was collected and, even in the case of an inconsistencies, there were some interesting differences - rather speaking, we could have a "right" and a "inconsistencies" legislation, but in practice we are applying some parameters to Germany's access.
It should therefore be noted that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how can this project help you what it means to you?
Such joint monitoring can contribute to efforts to clarify, reduce and improve restrictions, as this does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means obtaining a reasonable (not always low) price to avoid food and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're doing this, but we're downgrading orders.
It may be that this system will be filled with "bumchams" so that those who want to find lasers in this system will find them much easier than if the restrictions were not reduced.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our CRU (Control and Audit Management) or is it working otherwise?
As for the institutions, our CRA, the Bundesrechungshof, established by our principle, also has a college that works a little differently, but basically both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the powers to a certain extent are similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the federal level, in which their systems differ slightly from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting rooms.
What about local law, there's more than we have?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some cases, Germany can be taken for a sample, but I cannot say with certainty that it is best in all.
That's because they're better at controlling?
Of course not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefits from cooperating with our office, would they?
In terms of domestic legislation, how has the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affected your institution, and how has the effects been affected?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short enough, it has not yet appeared in our control work.
As we are monitoring the fact, some delays need to be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we started using our new tool "recognizing the risk of inequity", through which we passed almost 14,000 public contracts, which we analyzed, and of course, these changes will occur because of changing restrictions, changing the conditions of certain types of tenders and so on.
How do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or further load on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules are "exceeding" and will not be able to comply with them.
In the case of previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes, with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with public procurement law means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it possible to break the law in such a way?
I don't think that way.
The system should exclude those who want to be arrested and abused, but not those who make a formal mistake without a decision.
Such a system would only create further pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do you get out of this situation?
Let's know that this path will never come.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP would not worry about the verifications of the so-called swart system.
"Swartz-system" banned or authorized?
The law should be in some way established, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of bodies that are changed to verify and fulfil obligations.
We can say, "We change this law and we can't say that we're going to be arrested unless there's anything going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains sufficiently strict rules as must be carried out formally and properly, which will protect public procurement.
On the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be ideal, but it must be applied properly, which I believe is not enough for us.
Roads are expensive, but mainly through.
In some places the streets of Chechia are frozen and frozen.
They're mostly walking, but somewhere with more caution.
Carlovar
Today at the end of Carlovar, the roads were on the way, but somewhere were frozen and frozen.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should be less warm.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, but only in the lowlands is a small layer.
However, on the shores of the Rudno Mountains lies about 30 inches [30 cm] of snow.
The information received from road workers in the area was known to have been less visible due to traffic accidents.
The 6th R6 and the roads of the first class in the region are currently being carried out without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, to bridges where the surface can be narrow and narrow.
Also, all roads related to the second and third classes, including mountain crossings, are on the way.
But in some of their areas there are still remains of frozen snow and snow.
It is particularly important to be on the roads of heights.
Pardubic and King of the Grapes
The Czech road and highway management on its pages on the Internet informs that some of the streets in eastern Chechia are freezing cold, while on the mountain roads and on the roads at altitudes, there may be a snowy snowfall.
Road workers are warned of hunger leaders, who can be trained especially at the heights of the Pardubic region.
The Goliath may be around Lanskroun, Usti-nad-Orlici, Politicians, Switavi or High-Mito, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located in Switzerland, are processed by chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the streets of Crkonos and Orlic Mountains.
The snow layer is located on the roads of the highest elevations in the Rihnova-Nad-Kneznou and Trutnov areas.
In East Chechia today, the change of clothing is unscathed.
The temperature usually varies from less than three to more than one degree of Celsius, a light wind.
Plenary End
The roads in the Plysian region are on the way this morning, but there is a need to be careful and adaptable.
Early in the morning, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent colding in some places, it may be expensive.
Drivers can deal with the project, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by road workers.
Shosse D5 is now virtually unlimited, but road managers recommend that you exercise caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first class road has dry and dry surfaces.
In southern Plysne and Tahoes can be found in dry areas.
The roads of the second and third classes are on foot, and in this case there is a warning of the possibility of cross-country crossings.
Leaders must be careful, especially on the narrow roads in the Shumava region.
Baltic Sea
Leaders heading to the heights of the Olomouk region need to take into account today's snowfall on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals at the Red Cross and on the road towards the Video Cross.
On the night of snowfall, the road workers, according to information from road management, appeared about three inches [3 cm] above the snow.
In other areas, the end of the road, as it were, is usually without limits.
"On the heights of Schamperka lies the rest of the snow.
Heads of the Essenica side must have a snowbox in the Red Sea," said HAN (Chash News Agency) now, a Shamperkwal road controller.
On the night of the street cleaning, their colleagues from Essenica also realized that the roads to heights after the treatment of chemicals remained large and dark.
There are no restrictions on the road in Olamooc, but in Sternberg, drivers need to be careful in forest areas where capacity is still to be maintained.
The End of the End, the End of Liberia
Road workers from North Bohemia report today that a few difficult places remain.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several locations with a cold or snowfall, the upper road is closed at Telnice, in the eastern part of the coast.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads, especially in the south-east of Chechnya, the opposite, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
There are no reports of road complications yet.
Travellers report the phenomenon of hunger in the United States.
According to meteorologists, the night was the ideal setting for his education - all day the rain and the snow wave, the night the sky was clear and the tide began.
The adverse conditions are reported in the main six and in the I/13 traverses at the border of the Eastern and Liberian borders.
Because of the snowfall of the windy trees on the very road, it was forced to close the road to Telnica on the Book.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to buy positive energy
What do you think that less than a month should come to the end of the world?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we, people, look so easy.
Together with the Group of The Tap Tap, we are constantly looking at this topic and say that we are the only group in the world that can collect enough positive energy to accelerate or prevent the end of the world.
More than that, in December you're going to give absolutely three unique concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell us more about these readers?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning here for two years.
We have decided to use the marketing potential that holds the Maya calendar, which ended on 21 December at 11:10.
Before this event, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be held in parallel on 20 December.
They're gonna end up, speaking rudely, at the time when the Chiribati island in the Pacific Ocean, the clocklight that's 12 hours earlier than we've got, is going to end the mother's calendar.
Who's got this idea in his head?
I mean, that was my idea, and we've been thinking about it with our artist, José Auguste.
In addition to our desire to collect enough positive energy and to prevent the end of the world, we also want to share with the public in thinking about the state of this world that we will once give to our children.
At the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, shoes, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and therefore support us accordingly.
The Tap Tap Tap group, together with other musicians, also performed a game against the end of the world, called the World End.
Does the popular YouTube audiences have a reputation for these beneficial concerts?
Of course, in the end, if everything goes on and the end of the world doesn't come.
All performers at all concerts start it at the same time.
At the same time, the gymnasiums are also called in the direct ephere of Czech television.
The words of this song were written and played Jesus' role in Tomas Ganak, also involved in the execution of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also work with other Czech cultural people, as we perform many well-being activities and concerts.
We are trying to actively involve them in these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, and they care.
What will be the outcome of the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the free education centre STUDEO, we've been working in this way for six years with the Tap civil union in the Edlich Institute.
Teachers regularly visit the schools of the Edlich Institute and conduct happy and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves have no means to go to teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
In the context of the project for the further construction of the Edlica Institute, a separate building will come up in the future, in which we will transform it into a project.
A number of musical groups and performers will be held at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to establish a programme that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, there are Chinaski, Support lesbians, Illustratraphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Mariana Bango and Irži Suhi.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "gravitational events" in the future?
In May we will begin with the "Press News" festival and, of course, we will prepare an interesting programme with interested guests.
The following year, we would be pleased to present in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally wish to speak in Washington and Chicago if we were in the United States.
You've already made serious plans in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited opportunities.
How do you deal with the road from the point of view of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it's said at first sight.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their bicycles should travel to the freight office, plus all the large quantities of goods and tools.
However, as far as this was concerned, the Czech ČSA planes and the British Airways were always prepared for us so many times that I was surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we had recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you been up to?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, we have seen that in Russia we are still at the base level in the east.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are a lot of barriers, and there is still an independent movement of man in the tank on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there are no bananas such as to catch the path of the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to focus attention on people with limited opportunities.
On the other hand, what must we always do with the best countries?
There's a lot of stuff, the level of performance that's far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal that people with a severe disability move on the streets themselves, can go to a toilet, to a museum, to a convenient place...
It is not so widespread that a large number of people with limited opportunities are actively involved in public life, and we are with The Tap Tap a little over!
Public awareness or security is one thing, but at the moment that we are surrounded by prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, everything and the truth will begin to change.
Until these single cases are people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but we'll be back two years ago, that it stopped you from organizing it in 1998?
I went to Edlich's institute as a teacher, surrounded by a lot of young people who wanted something to do.
And since I am a musician and play, including on the sassophone, I organized an interesting musical circle together with my colleague.
Well, as our lead Lady Angelovic says, it's a little out of control.
The popularity has only come in recent years, or am I going something?
This is true, it has helped us to start joining the so-called leaders and to work actively on the promotional group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess, in fact, does not exist.
Thanks to the resources of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of expanding The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
In Shaw business, it's a whole thing that's touching each other.
It's logical, it's all taken care of, and it's been a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I'm ashamed to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, is of course...
However, this complaint is completely excessive because people with limited opportunities are not suffering and all the bereaved persons to whom we must complain.
They are people who can live and develop, of course, only if they have the resources they need.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities get something, it's not just for them, but for society as a whole.
Has it been a success that you are a hard leader, who many consider you to be?
If we want to do a good job, we must be in many uncompromising things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and fly in the fields, and when they know that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, visit preparatory courses, and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and get something.
At present, the group of The Tap Tap is composed of twenty people.
How many of them were there early in 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We open a group, people come and go, that's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the power of the will, our doors are always open.
It will be held until the expected end of the world on Thursday, 20 December 2012, at 2 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba Stadium, Brno, Fléda and Ostrava Club, in the centre of Plynoj with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities were joined by telescopics at the time of the performance of the song group The Tap Tap “The End of the World Is Disappeared”.
The aim of the project is to collect funding of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional spare parts for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlicca Institute in Prague.
The ticket for the concert is 400 kroner for children up to 12 years of age. The tickets can be bought earlier in Bohemiaticket.
Polish and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by twenty members of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern Block (after Chechia, which became a full member of ECA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and has been actively involved in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But the way to the space of Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts took place in space, but this did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, which was presented in the Warsaw Astronomy Observatory on 6 December 1933 in its innovative work "Introduction into space".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left a similar audience, and after a few years, Sternfield recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfield won Robert Assun-Peltri and André Luisa Hirsa Award for "Introduction into Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a major advocate of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became known as a world cosmonautist, and his contribution was appreciated, including that one of the craters on the other side of Luna was named in his honor.
In 1925 a railway train station was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as is the details of the project.
It is not even clear that a rocket should have been used to break down or to break down the fabric.
The information on this scene is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has started to think about rockets.
The study was conducted by the Arms Technology Section, in collaboration with Professors Mehluk and Gustav Mokjiski.
It is evident from the findings that studies have been conducted in practice.
But when German troops arrived, they were stopped.
In 1937 the idea of a photoelectric rocket launcher proposed by the Rogozinski engineer was presented in a specialized press, and the following year the work of the "Aeroplane Tropeda and Aeroplanets" was launched by the author of Lelevov-Kivoblock.
Both projects have been developed for the military use of rocket engines.
The Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczaskot doradczo-Naukwy) was established in front of all military projects for the use of rocket technology.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, the work had been completed since the start of the war.
The next scientific work on cosmetics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronomy Society (Polskie Tovarzystwo Astronautique).
The first about society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of The Challenge, in which four extensive articles on astronomy are published.
In one of them, Professor Subotovic proposed that a society be organized to take place in space.
At the time, artificial satellite projects had already been traded, and it was clear that space research was a prospecting industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (POA) has tried to enter the international association of Astronauts (based in 1951) and has already become a member of the ODA.
The following year, the first POA President, Kazimez Zarankevic (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronauts.
He remained in that position until his very death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which has become the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first started on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of exceeding 1800 m, was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Thereafter an improved version of RM-1A was built and a two-step RM-2 test was carried out on the Bladow desert in 1959.
This rocket was about eight feet [1.4 m] long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The following version of the rocket was already able to perform this scientific work: RM-34 could exceed 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, further development was discontinued in 1962.
The first RM rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was thought to be two-pronged, its total length was 510 cm, and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (known as Meteor-1A, -1V and -1C) were developed, which were different from the size of the scientific equipment camera.
The Meteor-1A rocket had an area of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1C - 0.62l.
The maximum flight distance in all three types was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed Meteor-2 rockets and its first annual tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with an initial weight of 380 kg was capable of delivering a useful cargo of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also recalled that Poland entered the COSPAR (Cosmetic Research Committee) in 1960 and that two years later the COSPAR National Committee was established.
In addition, in the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space studies on Soviet art satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermesevski became the second intercomator after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Act on Public Works is not the solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court cancelled the law on public works.
The resolution led to a lively discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue with a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that separate economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is related to the principle of free trade and free movement of private capital, together with an unencumbered financial speculation.
As a result, a significant difference in the value of the labour force (employment fee) results in a cost-effective acceleration.
In this sense, it is necessary to understand the situation when the manufacturer, by means of the delivery of the goods, is trying to compete in economic competition with the fact that the price of the competitor is " increasing" in order to remove most of the market and thus increase its own income.
This means that for most entrepreneurs, the transfer of goods abroad, the purchase of goods abroad, or the loss of jobs, unemployment is increasing in countries where the cost of labour is higher than the rest of the world.
As private capital has no social responsibility, including for the unemployment caused by it, the inevitable costs of the State will increase for social needs.
In general, the situation has intensified the desire of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the public economic and social damage they are suffering from the loss of income.
The situation is so well known that specific statistical data should not be provided.
Non-core private capital approaches create at the level of the economy of individual States, when Governments are forced to engage in competition with one another in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments have given their own people the opportunity to own private capital despite the social fall.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in existing legislation.
The aim is to make the people of their people financially dependent on the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic pressure in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as an instrument for the right of workers to labour legislation.
As a result, poverty is rising, however, and the gap between the poor and the rich is widening.
In the FRG, there has been a public distribution of poor products for several years that are not able to declare their work.
The number of these people is already approaching millions.
In the context of enhancing the competitiveness of the German economy, cases continue when employed persons receive a payment that the State must pay to them in order to obtain a living minimum.
Such a scandal has become known to the public and in the case of additional workers in Bundestag.
Economic measures in all the southern EU countries undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic social status are forced to move or migrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to live on a poor pay in the face of society, hoping that a private investment will ever come into the country.
But he's asking where he's going?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, such as China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, and Africa, it still works for the share of European wages.
It's all about Latin America.
The liberal theory and media of mass information to the darkness confirm that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that the economy is headed for economic disaster.
Part-capital capital insists that the State should not engage in economic management.
Should it continue to be answered to the question of whether private capital is operating, now in practice, and to the whole State, for its own selfish purposes?
The exact answer is yes.
The evidence is that there are practically all the powerful and powerful wolves in all States.
As a result, we have an unsustainable situation of corruption, mutual benefits, in legislation where punishment is practically deserved, but it is not a crime.
In the FRG the situation is such that public ministries, due to lack of financial resources, order the development of projects for private legal firms that are closely related to industry.
These draft legislation is then approved by the Bundestag.
All power belongs, not to the people, as is the constitution of the Western type, but to the financial and energy groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now taking place quickly in this situation, as described by the Appian in the "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The State is already broken up and the authorities are involved in violence.
Recruitment, illegal access to mercy through stones and swords.
"Seriously, the only rescue in this terrible situation is self-defence and the need for a man to choose the first vote" -- the ordinary people did not vote in the government's office at the end of the eight-month period, and the state remained unconsulted at the end of the day." "The truth began to say that the only rescue in this terrible situation was a state of self-determination and the need for a man to choose the energy." The opior thought it would be a Pompey, but they had become a Caesar, who eventually changed democracy on its own.
As in the past, in today's society, their own unjust interests are overstated without taking into account public interests.
The share capital is not, in fact, intended for public use.
The present outcome is not different from that of the past: an unimposed fall of the elite without any effort to undertake a more profound reform.
That is why we should seek the unwarranted liberalization of economic systems for the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of the democracy of the liberal type can be seen as a certain pause, after which the next tour is expected.
Above all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the impact of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are seeing now, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the Act on Public Works is not a decision or at least not always.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The decision is the objective political and social reforms that will strengthen the long-term participation of States in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the rule of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Hoosa Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and never will come out," says Sting, a song called "The Group," where the main word "we don't forget what we're stupid."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't be there" -- the dying Guatemalan Schnaper, Meer Amchel Rotschold's wife.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has caused a number of challenges.
Some speak for Israel, arguing that he has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians have the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians by arguing that this is the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is credited with the role of the State of terrorism.
I do not want to think about who is the victim, at the end of the day, of the present state of Israel, including self-government, born in the current political situation and who were not witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look forward to seeing those who have been serving for 95 years (reading from the signature of the Balfua Declaration in November 1917) in the small part of the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their trophies, someone who has done their deeds for the earlier intended purposes.
It should be admitted that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few people, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power of one generation could not exist.
Among the astronomically rich families is one that could be seen as the head of the road (I don't know if anyone is above them, but that's not excluded) - Rotchilda.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The First News Agency (Ratters) has purchased in the 1990s to stop hearings related to criminal activities in the areas in which they were located, and always to strengthen their power, prosperity or at the same time, and to others.
They have large shares in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they do not have their share, they lead or prepare for war (until the invasion of Afghanistan was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, only four countries remained after the Qadafi invasion, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the status of the Central Bank behind the Rotchöldsk Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to issue his own (intergovernmental) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (the federal reserve system) in 1963, and was executed in 1936 after he wanted to appeal to the FED court for the development of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their aspirations by the world government for the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars, created by the massive mass of the 33rd level of Albert Paiko.
The goal of the first war was to destroy the monarchy in Europe, the second should be to destroy colonial sovereignty, especially the United Kingdom, and the third should bring about a reduction of approximately 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and growth, and they would not need many resources), the establishment of a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final capture of absolute authority.
The method by which a group of the richest families is working in the head of Rotschilda is the challenges of the crisis and the next proposal for a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED Foundation, which had to prevent the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to engage in the first world war through the murder of the Austrian-Vengeran descendant of the Austro-Vender in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia, beginning with the majority revolution.
The first world war ended in a sudden, inconsistencies in the military and economic capitalization of Germany (the need for war to destroy the King Russia) and, as a result, the breakdown of the Central European State, Austria.
In order to facilitate the development of the Second World War, the Banks and politicians have created a complex conflict situation by imposing huge military reparations on Germany that have created a precalibration of the combined mass, then only to abandon the Germans to a strong enough and simple solution of the Leader, further to establish a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that was to be played, and actually played the fifth pillar, in the aftermath of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotchalda had proposed the foundation of a Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish State, desirable in the area of historical Judah and Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion).
The above-mentioned declaration of Balfura created a premise for the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, beginning with the first contact with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War struck, and it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had been taken out of the ranks of which he was allegedly held by the banks, or all he had done was planned, that in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps had created prejudices for the recognition of the Jewish State of the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as Germany was subjected to military reparations at the 2nd world war, the State of Israel was declared to establish a major third-party war.
If international banks can connect it, the Jewish people, as well as in the second world war, will be victims of war on the front line, now with the Arab or, in other words, the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is said to be a giant laboratory, a source of disintegration and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people on the sidelines and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where is the temptation to be tried in an endless cycle of violence if it all begins with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international banks are subject to people to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel's invasion of Netanyah is a typical example of a fascist, illegal international banking policy that is doing everything to start war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to move into the world conflict, and taking into account Iran's control over the Ormos River, which contains 20 per cent of all world oil reserves (the East corridor consists of only 2 miles wide), it will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockweller in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will adopt a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the peace of the Lord and of the slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population serves as the fuel of a financial aristocraticism, enjoying comfort.
The world where each birth of the organism is formed is a chip with which it becomes a substance under the control of the atom.
"And it compels all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hand or on their tongue, so that a man who is not marked by the beast's name or the number of his name could not buy or sell.
Here is wisdom: Everyone who has understanding can calculate the number of beasts.
For it is according to the names of the people, and the number of them is sixty-six.
"Operation "Argo": When you get worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic demonstrators arrested the United States Embassy in Tehran and taken 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for the sworn sword of Mohammed Rezi Pehlev, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been the guardian of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration did not expect the positive outcome of the situation - it could not allow itself to get out of the ship because it could undermine the confidence of the allies in other countries.
However, the release of prisoners in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not possible.
It was an attack against the United States, which was later forced to attempt to free the prisoners of force.
The detainees were finally released after 444 days after negotiations with the Government of Algeria.
Their trial brought home a wave of solidarity and anti-aircraft.
The defeat in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter at the 1980 presidential elections completed by Ronald Reygan.
The film, organized by the actor Ben Afflek, "Operation " Argo" describes one of the episodes of history that led to a small victory in America.
Six employees were able to escape before the occupation of the mission.
After a difficult period, they ended their journey to the Canadian Embassy.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CD has been able to remove them from Iran and has helped to provide an extravagance legend of the cover that they have gone through Canadian passports as members of a group of demonstrators who are in the country for scientific and fantastic purposes.
Gender-collection
The plan chosen by an Evacation expert, Tony Mendez, called for Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to ensure that the legend was reliable, the specialized journals had written about a film project, the press conference, which the manufacturing company urged to have a real office.
The details of the operation were kept in secret, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
The Affleca film is a special combination of several generations.
On the one hand, a real political tripler, so-called a movie cinema, a history of success, may be a few films about Ouschen's friends.
The film constantly changes the settings - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tegeran (the titles show signs of historical events, and how the same situations were shown in the film - big differences.)
On the other hand, it is easy to remove Hollywood waste from irony and moderate oversize.
And then more scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in the costumes discuss the situation on the table, on the desks, on the phone...
Bena Affleku has been very successful in making the rest of his career.
From the Muslim actor, he became a respected director, and his game ceased to be an object of ridicule.
"Argo" is his third full-time film, followed by the dark detective "Shit, child, excuse" (2007) and the "Hood" trailer (2001).
At the same time, it's the first film of Affleka, which is not filmed in the hometown of the director of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place is related to the qualities that raised earlier the director's film over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflek shows it in "Argo", where Tegeran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, when real events are reconstructed - the front scenes of the mission's fall are impressed by its clarity, which also conveyes the emotions of the journey and the uncertainty that arise when history changes suddenly.
The effect of Afflek and his colleagues is achieved in the stage of the involved (sub-heading at the Tegeran Base).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to be informed that the event did not involve a large number of cinematographic scenes.
He's working pretty well with these few things, sometimes he's thinking - all of this doesn't come out so elegant (the scene in which a telephone call in America prevents an overcrowding crisis in Tegeran Airport, and a hit on the airfield looks pretty cleverly.)
The lack of "Argo" is an ambiguity that requires too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are really very tired about the role of Hollywood colleagues, but their staff would earn more space, and they are not alone in the film.
Affleka's film does not capture a little dramatism, a film that can be viewed with a moderate interest by assessing the order and retro-style that restores the triples of the seventy-sevens.
But he's busy.
In addition, this is sufficient to remind of one, still in the sense of living history, as well as to show how the representations of all the powerful and all-knowing services have been increased.
Air-conditioning regulations, bananas and circuses
Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, conducting an annual survey of the most absurd banking collections, has now decided to announce a competition to “all the absurd ruling or project from the master EU”.
“We have been led to this last event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said Patrick Nager, founder of Justice.
The recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women has already been made.
Women have thus far benefited from life insurance because they are less likely for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from master EU people can compete until the end of this year.
Only the vote will take place by the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU's dispute orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biofuels to fuel, which is harmful to nature, as well as the prohibition on the use of reliable raw materials only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances or a directive on the size of the smoke cell, which has caused the egg to be significantly damaged this year.
The criticism was also a fact-finding ban on the use of the term "boterborn oil" or the exclusion from the sale of classical lamps.
High-quality bananas should be 14 cm long.
The European public equipment often decides to press any other trade or industrial lobby that is normally protected by any State or group of States in Brussels (which is now even under the threat of a storm, the demands of its banks are being rejected).
The interests of lobbying such as, for example, high quality bananas in the Euro-Union were to reach a length of 14 cm and were not able to show "anomal crime".
However, the European Commission was justified in harmonizing only the existing various national rules that have made trade difficult.
The EU, despite the opposition of some States, has still reduced standards regarding fruit and vegetables, bearing in mind that existing directives will lead to product dispersion.
The candidate for the win in the survey may also become an EU decision in the past year, which states that air-sellers should be obliged to warn that children under eight years of age cannot rely on them without the attention of adults.
The EU has referred to American studies, which suggest that air scars are a potential cause of the death of children by breathing.
Such restrictions are now extended to children up to 14 years of age, who are prohibited from thinking in arms.
Fun ideas are also born at home
The rule on European officials is too absurd: everyone in the EU who has an official position cannot use the name Macedonia, and should rather be called "BURM" (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Portal Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Free Economy Principles for Non-Inclusion (Laissez Faire), proposed to vote, in addition to several of the absurd rules mentioned above, for example, the EU food stocks regulation in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food stocks available in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the Euro-Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the levels of preserved fish, for which it suffered a large amount of damage.
The investigators were also interested in the idea of paying to some countries for their lack of sea and the idea of providing subsidies for a claim for subsidies.
But these ideas came from Prague, not Brussels.
"We're in a bad situation, because we don't have a sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said in June 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palas (PSC).
As an argument, he indicated that the country had a high crop of grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the State had full stocks to be exported.
Because Czechia is far away from the ports, the EU, according to Palasu, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission attended a meeting of the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for the grant of subsidies were proposed by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), and in particular, such subsidies had to be made available to the provinces of Brussels.
EU: Exciting orders are exceptional
While decision-making in Member States is easy to become the object of criticism, EU efforts to regulate, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the Euro-Union are, in the opinion of many experts, worthy of prompt recognition.
The serious problem, experts believe, is that the EU's allocations to projects that are not even targeted at something in general with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
It is a feeling among the Czechs and that, as in other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, since it does not always win in this encounter.
Although after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, the name "Olomoukkas", but the "Tusem Roma", which our country has had its roots in the 19th century, our producers had to be called "Tuzemak".
It can be called a roman, not a sugar beet, but products from a sweetened distillate.
The official list of EU registered products, together with world-known "feet" and "gorgondzol" brands from Germany's Lubeca or Parmian beet, has already been made, for example, carrowar sugars, carrots and turboene carp and jattes.
The EU's brand can also be proud of the paradubic ring and the sharp curves.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm a lover, says Ocamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to be in charge of the president's position?
I don't think he's gonna be a senator or a president himself.
If we had everything in our country without problems, I would never have fought.
But I can't see how in the last 20 years, countries have developed, how many times there are, people have increased taxes and pensions.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I've been married for 40 years and I'm an independent person who doesn't care about any party, I have no choice but to vote for the senator or president.
You've fallen into the Senate, but soon you've gone to the presidential castle.
Will you not then turn to the people you have chosen?
I have always said that I would be involved in fighting for the presidential closure depending on the outcome of the elections in Senate.
Later, I explained that if I were elected by the senator, I would vote in the presidential elections.
My goal is not a position, a position is an instrument I can use to implement my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and greater powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation are in a bar or on television, but that's when everyone tries to change something.
This is added to the media that make people laugh, and who walk freely with freedom of speech.
For example, both of us were told that I was taking the press or that I was an adviser to Irži Paroubek.
Let's go look at you.
The presidential closing battle began with thesis on the material and criminal responsibility of politics and on the return of property statements of more than 20 million.
For this to be done, the law needs to be amended.
You do not have such authority as the President, and only the whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to handle this?
When I became a citizen, I was able to move on as a free enterprise.
The problem lies in politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, there is a tendency to oppose him, and that keeps citizens from doing so.
As an independent independent human being, I have much greater capacity to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take into each party what is best for our country without a party schedule, without consideration of the agreement, and to apply it.
Do you think you're a man more related to the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm more of a left-handed man.
It doesn't matter to me - a little left or a little right.
I think it's important for us to move forward.
It's not about someone who's right, but about someone on the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it is proposed by CPC or GDP, and I will be right against bad ideas.
You're wrong when someone says you're popular.
But don't you prove that what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to do.
It can be called populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or some experts are talking about them.
But without Parliament's support, you will be left with only a lie.
And you won't stay long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out and talk to people, you will be able to carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other chance.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to change them on our side so that we can get ours.
If I had been elected as President, there would have been no problem in organizing direct television transmission, in which I would appeal to the Presidents of Parliament to legislate material and criminal responsibility for policies, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they do not want to.
If there is a strong personality that causes abuse, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take the President's direct election -- that was a public pressure.
I'm just saying that I'm a lover, not a genius, and I didn't understand.
I'm trying to look for allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I'm just getting started in politics, and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I'm trying to move forward on my own; if that doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
This part sounds like Ocamura has to save Cheyau.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know I'm not doing anything, so I've met a number of famous people with a proposal to fly to the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchore, and he gave up much work.
At the same time, I also supported the leading research of journalist Jan Lorenz, who revealed the confusion with light-boiling petroleum products.
I made my application because people and truth are not satisfied, but now I feel on my shoulders.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, but most of those who were elected to the post office.
Only two of us independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will work.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and Governors.
Do you think about the foundation of your own party?
I didn't think about it, because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential member of the past, and I don't have any money for that.
There's no money on the presidential campaign, in my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how are your own cases related to this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth about 25 million, an area of 10 million, another 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, Aston Martin, 3.5 million, and Scotland Superb for millions, and a few millions more.
Aston Martin's accident occurred to me because it was my little dream, and I always liked James Bond, who was riding on a car, was a gallant with women, and at the same time fighting corruption and lawlessness.
You drive to Aston Martine, you own 60 million property and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you do not want to put your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million in the campaign.
Do I have to go in?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors proves that my programme is not that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a pre-election campaign from my karman.
The costs of the campaign actually cover the senator's pay.
But I wouldn't live on these money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school, which is worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't have fought that.
So you're still going to work on a business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're going to slow down this activity?
But that doesn't depend on the amount of pay.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activity.
For example, the director of the tourism agency will become my deputy.
People would like me to be a freeman who will keep the Republic.
But I also need something to live for.
As an entrepreneur, how many of you used to get a month?
From two hundred to four thousand that I get.
And if I'd become president, my business would have ended.
You'll find a full interview on the Saturday issue of the "Right".
The MVRDV architects demonstrate that these conclusions are not just in the picture - for example, Spain and its recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks fun, and we can finally see something interesting again," said Liesette Verheig, walking along the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a close-up to the big business, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I wonder, why is there another library for us today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
Now no one willingly goes to such old - fashioned libraries, right?
Spikenisse, a small town in Rotterdam, is an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this growing situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven enthusiast bridges, which were painted on euro banknotes, as a lifelined miniature from the railway.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city’s fathers realized that they had the only chance of getting rid of the statistics — to build a library here!
Maas of the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of strong columns and author of ossroms, sometimes even of kinic constructions, was responsible for his usual inhumanity and appeared at a competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and the face.
As soon as the jury members looked down and touched the plates, Dr. Maas obtained from his original prized prize and finished his project with the following words: "Creativeed thieves!"
Here's my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Spain, so-called Buchenberg!
After nine years this mountain has grown to 30 million euros.
It is part of the project of revitalization, which also includes underground garages, supermarkets, mails and several of the homes and taunhaus in a total of 50 rooms.
At the beginning of November, the "The Book Mountain" was noted as the second prize of the "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012" competition.
The project also participates in the 2012 national Dutch competition for forest weapons.
Thus, the endless reward that could not have been offered before, in addition to the post-modernist walking zone and an amazingly unpretentious rat, the white phases of the milkwater industry have become more rich in one modern architecture.
But most importantly, in Spain there was the first public building in the history of this city.
The Long Way to the Book
First impression: Eldorado under his hat for cheese.
There is only one elevator in the centre of the upper mass, since these worshippers of architecture and reading prefer to study this place through the passage.
A light and light-sighted room, the fields of the decorated carpet and the elegant street forums inevitably create a sense of the public square.
The city environment is ideally restored.
The view is difficult to find in the shoes, dogs, and football players and girls.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
"The books are usually under fascinate, and in the middle there is a large dark room, usually empty and empty," says Vini Maas.
We set up a classic configuration of space with a foot on our head and removed the area to read inside the loop.
The inner space of the book is used skillfully: office, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities are located in the center.
In particular, black book boxes, which serve as the wall section, the parapets, and the woodpeckers.
Their type, texture and smell are unusual.
Even tested architects and engineers are lost in clues that this is for unknown material.
"We have tried to work with secondary materials," explains Yoop Trauborst, project leader of the Spanish community, in accordance with standard requirements.
And once on one farm in France, we met an appropriate agricultural product.
For many years in the Netherlands and in the fields, artificial rubber material has been used as a base for millimetres.
It's a waste of time and money.
Tonky textile is served for one or two seasons, then it can be deleted.
For libraries, this is half - first in such quantities - was printed in the bottom panel of four centimetres.
Under the threat and pressure of the so-called Landbapult (KLP) is turned into a dark, unusual, durable material, after a little memory of a new car and a little cross-section.
The top is 105 degrees.
The person who passes a distance of almost 500 metres will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with the Dutch crotches and wooden figurines in the mountains.
They are concerned about the atmosphere and, firstly, about the correct air position on the literary hill.
Costs for a New Soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," says Truborst.
The heat of the ground is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass of glass, even in clear daylight the sun falls within just a few minutes.
The shrubs from the woody tree, made up of perpendicularly glass, give the roofs and receive most of the sun’s light.
It's a nice room.
The rest of the protection provides a complete automatic rollout.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned earlier in the IT section, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verheig was here too.
The traditional Chinese medical teacher Sintiya Bocard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of Spikenis who had not been captured for a long time."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to offer a book from his own congregation.
These books were to be placed in empty spaces not yet fully integrated libraries, at the time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The poles are on the surface.
"Nothing worse than a broken library," says Architect Vini Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has some connection with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she's only serving to steal.
Thus, MVRDV was able to address a royal task called the establishment of identity in the professional district.
Spikenisse wrote his literature history.
And leave them to be young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point to build identity.
To: "The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
In the view of Stephen Sabo, an expert in relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin is thus balanced on the short diplomatic route.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany began to understand that it was protesting against Palestinian requests for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin withdrew from voting.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without saying too much criticism about Israel.
At the time of the resurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a restricted zone for flights.
NATO has thus made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is to say, from the policy that the United States has managed, in itself, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a uniform policy for Europeans.
Thus, the Germans are again shown between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it.
I think they're just putting on their role, but they're on their way to "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy conducted by France or Great Britain.
What, in particular, does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
This is a willingness to take into account their national interests, which does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that Germany's foreign policy depends on economic policy, it's from exports and connections with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests differ significantly from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets for arrival in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be careful not to disturb the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I wouldn't have given this too much importance, it wasn't a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, this plays an important role in German calculations.
Has Germany been affected by its relations with the United States, continuing to make important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position is overemphasized.
That's why I don't think it was the same drama as the Libyan issue.
It is possible that Germany will even acquire such a certain respect.
This is a signal that it should be accepted as a game at the international scene and that it should be considered to be of interest.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the contrary, was clearly speaking of the widow.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European States?
Such differences have always existed under American domestic policies.
I believe that the Government of Obama has sufficient understanding of the European position in the mind.
However, because of the local political situation, the Government cannot, of course, take such a position openly.
I believe that significant differences in opinions are not as significant as they always seem.
If you are considering the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyah, note that Obama is not at all out of Netanyah's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the status of the most important partner in the EU with the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, Germans would have been a little easier if there were a single European policy, but it is not.
Therefore, they cannot make a broader approach and are forced to act instead, depending only on their own view of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will play a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is understandable that this is not easy for Germany, even if it is because of ties with Israel.
This topic was always sweet.
But I think Germans clearly must play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself in the role of an important international game - won't it really play its main role?
Or is Germany still under the leadership?
Germany has not been accustomed to this, it has always been unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it has always been difficult to play a significant role.
Let us consider, for example, the crisis of the euro - every time Germany plays an important role, the most diverse anti-German feelings are expressed.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
Of course, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more serious situation than the United States.
It should take into account the most diverse neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Thus, the influence of the United States on European policy is constantly weakening, but at this moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who will remain?
Germans just have to play a more important role.
Even if you do not like it, it grieves you or strengthens your love for it, such a life!

"Protection of trade marks" in China: when Puma and Armani will suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known trade mark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what about Armani Polo?
It is perfectly officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with companies from whom it has been taught.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original name are searched.
But even then it is not clear whether they can defend their rights.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloh, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in violations of the rights of goods in the Far East.
On my table every week, it appears in a new case like this.
Imitators are sufficient to add a couple of letters to gain the right to register their trade marks.
So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as the Puma sports producer, are legally copied.
The cartridge opens a folder with records of the registration of the goods in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name, also used for the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the champions of the world for copying and violating intellectual property rights.
In large cities there are multiethnic universes that sell almost exclusively.
The Pattloha case, however, was not the case, and he ordered his creditors to oppose the fact that the Chinese companies were officially granted the right to use a name that was already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it a minimbay band, a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "Ban Dakuan".
That's what they call women who love rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize their guilt
"It damages business, and it needs to be fought," said Pattloh.
"The trade mark is confused, the unique situation is gone, the image is very painful."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA research company, China, with a sales of EUR 15 billion per year, is the third on average and the fastest growing market in growth.
However, it is difficult to remove suspicious records in the trade mark register, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an inexhaustible outcome.
The pits tell of cases in which the court rejected claims, as long as the contested term became “real market”.
If he doesn't tie up, he'll even have to pay the plaintiff, as it damages his trade mark in China, says Pattloh.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also significant cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a court dispute with the manufacturer of Sany, a company that had recently acquired the company of the concrete producers of Putzmeister.
That's why Chinese people still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The purchase of Volvo by Geely originally used a blue-white logo that had been mentioned by BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of the fashion goods Lacoste lost in China the imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the so-called crocodile was seen on the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that there was difficulties in 2010 due to lack of personnel and equipment.
In the past year, however, there has been “a return from the emergency to the normal process”.
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases of objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than in the past year.
At the same time, 81,500 claims still await production in the agency.
Fight that debt.
As is common in China, figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO had more than 1.4 million trade marks applications, almost three times more than in 2010.
This record means that China has ruled a list of new registrations worldwide in ten times, reports the press.
The same applies to the total number of actual trade marks, of all 5.5 million marks.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Junees of the congregations were paid.
To simplify this means that each registration is between 1280 and 160 euros.
It must be rejected much more than the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the conference has fought against the Chinese plagiarist.
Germany has been able to realize that the illicit production of the car parts it has provided has been eliminated.
However, the Immitor confirmed his Chinese right to trade mark Freudenberg.
This was a personal failure, as families in Germany were not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, President of the government of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trade mark registration agency rejected the Munich claim.
It is true that in both of the following institutions, Freudenberg won, but the opposition continued to fight.
Must be the beginning.
The issue is now under consideration in the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commend the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
If domestic costs are not taken into account, the company's archives have even been subject to a centuries-long review to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsustainablely proposed a "more than six-digit amount in the euro" for settlement.
"From here it's clear how much we owe it," says Ventzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even in Europe.
In that case, if the issuers are registered there for unprotected trade marks.
Yes, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for leather shoes and articles.
The conference has long stopped production in these areas, but it has been able to prevent registration.
"There must be no beginning," says Ventzler.
Both he and Pattloh are recommending German companies to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trade marks, rather foreigners should “all that must be protected in any way should also be registered in China”, says Ventzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg loses its trade mark drama in the last act, it will have to pay on the contrary the licensees for its own name, Ventzler explains.
Otherwise, we're getting out of the market in the dispute segment.
World Day of AIDS: Toppling, petition, to help
In Heidelberge, Imbonge's horn is replayed, and in Swaziland, the AIDS orphans are happy to do so.
History of relations over more than 8733 kilometres.
In the beginning, it is said that cowboy shoes, basketball clubs, dolls, and men's boots are picked up on the park floor and quickly find it.
Two-three-four.
Only then will they slowly raise the voices of the birds -- the altar, the pool, the tower, and the stop: they will rise, scatter, and follow each other.
And Féte Hopf, a 29-year-old director, hardly jumps out of his mother-in-law tufes when he drives them with mild and expressive passions.
On Monday evening, at the Music Hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Hydelberge Hor Imbongi, a new song is being played.
Fifty persons from 23 to 69 years of age, from genetic specialists to the court.
"Om "Obani" is not a simple thing, every voice of people has its own text in the same perfectly foreign language: a zero million people speak in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Assistance for self-help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme worldwide accounts for about 34 million HIV infected.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS patients live.
More than 40 per cent of the population is positive.
For 180 poor people in the Essian Forest, the Voices for Africa found leaders in Germany.
Seventy-seven of them attend the school for further training.
In 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take care of yourself.

In this room, they don't speak flying on the band, so they're capable of five.
For almost ten years, the choir has learned songs in this foreign soft tongue, and from time to time they have even been brought back to where they first appeared: in South Africa.
At a distance of 8733 kilometers from Haydelberga, northwestern Swaziland, is the village of Esitani, which depends on the voices of the German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people, some of whom are still living in simple giraffes and forests, among many children.
More than 300 of them survived without parents who died from IC virus.
The ministry reflects the disease of all Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy expected in the world by UNICEF data.
The reduction of the minimum wage in men, which has been shown to reduce the risk of half-life injuries, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than half of Swaziland's population are infected with immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is rare.
Hor opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, Imbogni had seen many children in the streets, not only in parental care but also in everything: food, clothing, education.
Without education, people in poor countries have no chance at all.
This was initially a private obligation of individual participants - several euros a year to send a child to school and give him a chance to get hot food once a day.
However, a year later, the Voices for Africa was founded, which has been almost professionally concerned with AIDS patients in Essitania.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the major diseases transmitted by sex?
Bacterial IPPs include syphilis, chlamidosis and tripura (gonorium).
The most common among the virus IPPs are HIV, human papillom-virus, genetic hempes and hepatitis.
Lobian pediculosis and frequency are related to parasitic IPP.
What are the main vulnerable groups?
Siphilis and honourers meet mainly with men who have sex with men.
The Institute of Robert Koha concludes that, at least in four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults often experience sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlomodialysis, trichomonia, candidosis (graboc), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, the HMDs are much more common than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three fourths of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
We have young people also often met with human papillom virus.
How does the number of cases of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to Robert Koha Institute, has doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2700 cases.
It's about a decade less than in the past year.
What are some symptoms of venous disease?
Infectious diseases, there may be gender gaps, complaints about rape, separation, life-threatening pain, as well as dust or discharges.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
Conservatives are able to reduce the risk of injury, but do not provide a percentage of protection.
In part, sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend regular surveys, particularly in the case of frequent exchange of sex partners.
In early diagnosis, most PPPs can be treated and avoid remote consequences.
The leadership, the award and not least the honours of public speaking throughout Germany allow something to be collected.
"All of us have already sent to Essitania about 200,000 euros," said Annete Lennartz, president of the Association.
In the very forest money from Germany is directed by Códva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
It will also care for the well - being of the poor, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call it, old women, it's a forest bridge.
Some of them have taken up to 14 sicks, give them a headache, and worry that children will appear at school every day.
Those who do not have a family will be invited to Hannizil, the only woman who receives a united wage, as well as two grandparents who prepare for more than 200 hungry children each day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a Swiss school, built two smokers, and, together with the American Health Organization, organized a HIV analysis for many rural people.
It's hard to imagine, but about the disease that is so obvious all over the country, they prefer to shut down.
The King With 14 Women
"Spid is an absolute taboo," says Annete Lennartz, "because it's about sex."
It is unusual for a country where the king has 14 women officially.
The last absolute monarchs of black Africa, King Msvati III, are known for his love for excellence.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the life- style of such a sanctions State is also guilty of the rapid spread of IC virus in the past year.
But it is also on the shipyards that spread the virus across the country.
Free storage is literally on every corner, says Annete Lennartz, "but they're almost out of use.
The second culture is flat to flat."
To support a little cultural exchange, Ibmogni has been traveling south of Africa every two-thirds of the year and is a poet, full of songs, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many in the south of the black continent have known since the time of apartheid.
A bus, full of whites, singing songs in black - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but it also brought tears to the eyes of hard frontiers.
The trip has always taken place in Essitania, where some visitors visit underage children.
Although a small wooden with work can be found on the map, it is known more than in the Eculvan River.
"Go to Essiten, there is the world," people say.
And after 8733 miles [8733 km] of flight back to Heidelberg, when the firemen return to the restaurant on Bergheimer Street, they can see that the light is burning here as well.
Messinger: NASA discovers ice in Mercurii
The Messeger probe found evidence that there is ice on the planet of Mercuri.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. Space Agency of the United States of America has proved the existence of a cloud on the planet of Mercuria.
Although it is located close to Solnzo, there are also frozen water, as is seen in three studies published in Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence that the constant presence in the darkness of the planet will be covered by ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 cm, possibly up to 20 meters.
It is likely that water comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that interact with Mercuri.
No one connects to the openness of life on earth, said the science director of the Sean Solomon Zone.
The temperature in Mercuria can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life have fallen into other parts of the solar system.
For Earth’s inhabitants, the zodiac, telescopes, and small jobs, such as Fenix, are studying the depth of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth: small faces in endless clouds.
The picture comes from cameras developed by German researchers from the Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system as well as the celestial planet.
As with Pluton, who is called around the sun for Neptune, Cerera, on the new definition of the International Astronomy Union since 2006, it is not "planned".
This fraction of the Infrared Telescope Spitzer represents the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, the more difficult to identify in the star's circle the pink "non-managed" stars.
This region of star formation - scientists have been calling it W5 - opened by the Telescope "Spitter" in the Cassiopia Association for the last 6500 years.
This moving star star photographed the NASA Telescope "Scitzer".
It looks like a puncture consists of material that the star has emitted in the process of dying.
In the giant darkness of Trifide, 5400 years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
The NASA Telescope "Spitter" made this photo of the Galactic Family Room.
The starship of the Pleiades, also called "Seam Sister", can be seen in the night with unarmed eyes.
Of course, with a telescope, they get better.
How beautiful the eye softens the darkness of the Street on this infrafractional picture.
It has been located for 700 years in the Union of Waters.
The link with the earth's continent led to this darkness called North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photographs provides an excellent color transition.
This new star in all beauty was able to photograph only with the help of the Infrared Telescope Spitzer.
Saturn and his knee: How they came up is one of the great orders of astronomy.
This may have been the difference between Saturn's moons, which suddenly disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: Galactica Waterways
Depending on the colouring of the photos of spiral galaxies, the art of this production is transformed.
The published European South Observatory shows that the darkness of Trifide in the constellation of the Star has been removed for thousands of years.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (threefold, threefold), as the dark areas of the dust divide into three parts of the scattered heart of the star.
In the Association of the Sociénos, astronomers photographed the spacecraft: at 400 million light-years from Earth's core, two floating galaxies will meet each other and will certainly meet each other.
This creation of the Habble telescope has been recorded in the spirit galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical reductions may call it the South Central College.
The photo of the space telescope Hobble shows the fragment of Iris' darkness in the Ceféa constellation.
The darkness, separated by the 1400s of the world, is part of the dust, which is ten to eight times smaller than that of the usual domestic dust.
This picture was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a number of black-and-white breeds that range from 430 million to 430 million worldwide years.
This Galactic Group, called Arp 273, photographed the NASA Space Telescope "Habble" for NASA.
Scientists call it UGC 1810.
In this starship there is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The constellation is constantly creating new stars.
It is the star cloud, coupled with the mystery of Rosetak, which is also constantly creating new stars, at the distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright light galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang when it was mainly in the universe.
Our Views in the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersheim - even before Galileo started observing the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescopes have become more and more accessible to their view of space.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the telescope "Hale" in Palomar under San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., a large binocular telescope was established.
It allows space to be seen using two circles, each diameter of 8.4 meters.
Gran Telescope Canarias has a giant internal device - a diameter of just one mirror is 10.4 meters.
The "Great South African Telescope" in South Africa has been segmented to reduce cost.
However, in the diameter it reaches about ten meters.
The lack of a few constructive performances: the telescope is strongly reinforced under the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The telescope "Hobbi-Eberley" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its speciality: high lighting capacity.
It achieves - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto-Rico), researchers are listening to ground signals in space.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the project "External understanding search" (SETI), any computer owner can assist by providing its accounting capacity.
Type of observation of the European Astronomy Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andahs.
There's a big telescope here, and it's exactly what it's called.
Its four shells allow even an average infrared spectrum to be revealed in the eye tube.
The Chilean observer ESO also plans to establish a European Large Telescope.
Its main shell must be broken to a total of 42 metres - and it will be made up of almost 1,000 steel elements.
However, photographs should be expected not earlier than 2018.
By 2007, the two Kek telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the world's largest.
They have two cubicles of a diameter of ten meters.
The Kek telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which is also seen in the sky with the help of the Subaru and the IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope must appear on Mauna-Cea with a circle of 30 meters.
This is where they can love the illustration.
However, the most important types of space are the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has displayed a picture of far-reaching worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope "Kepler" has been looking for planets outside the solar system, primarily those for which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidates had been identified from the start of the mission.
The latest production of the space telescope "Kepler" is shown on the photo.
The space telescope James Webb (JWST) will be sent to space by 2018 on the Arian 5 rocket.
The head of the infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of telescopes is that it should search for a greater explosion in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists assume that the south Pole of Mercuria is ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger returns close to the north Pole of the planet.
The guidelines for decades indicated that there was ice in Mercuria.
Thanks to the Messenger zone launched in 2004, the first to return to the area of Mercuria, the scientists are now convinced.

The trip through the Tallish Mountains can be called a bicycism and romantic.
Microbuss are scattered along the broad road along the greenest forests of Holms, Burrus Rivers, and Simple Cristian Homes.
The whole area is so green and bright that you might think you're in Schwarzvalde.
But this is the most southern part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few miles from here.
They live here, one of the people of Kavqas, who knows a little about it, except that they speak beautiful Persians and Azerbaijani and stand out for a long time.
The final item is Leric.
The small town is surrounded by a superheated architecture of Soviet times, which is totally out of harmony with the lively mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are not nearly here, the way from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too comfortable.
The distance is eight hours, and the road is one half.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea is here in the province until it is well-off.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is much interest in tourists in Lerika.
"In May Baku celebrated the festival of the Eurovision - and next year we will have the festival of elders of peace," says Fatuleva.
She's the director of a long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
The biography is documented here, about eight tons of tarts from these places, over 100 years ago. Fatuleva shows a black-white picture.
It's my grandfather, he's been here for 120 years.
At 136 years of age, he had another baby.
However, the museum is the Shab of Shirali Musslamov, which has been completed for 168 years.
The evidence of birth, however, is not.
In view of the fact that the old man, whose age has been confirmed by documents, has fulfilled 122 years, the age of Islam is extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatuleva.
He was married three times, and he had 23 children, and his daughter was born at the age of 136.
Did the Muslims add a couple of decades to their age?
Even Rambrandt Scholtz, an adult researcher from Max Planka Institute in Rostok, heard about debt in Central Asia.
"Very many people of advanced age can also meet in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunsa Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "there are also very old people in Sardinia."
However, because of the lack of documents, it is impossible to confirm age, as there were no civil status registers.
Every day a bottle of hot oil
However, the fact is that people in the area of Lerika are often quite elderly.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age living here.
Why are there so many people in the south?
The Azerbaijani expedition, Farid Mugimzad, explains that it is a special gene of a battalion.
The director of the Fatulaeva Museum, on the other hand, believes that it's about food.
People like meat, bread, and most of the milk products, many of them drink hot oil every day, but almost such a high calorie diet can be healthy with a diathetological view.
Or the case in the early life that keeps people young? In Chengemiran, a small village near the town of Lerick, Rubaba Mirzoeva lives.
At 97 years of age, she was still relatively young for these ranges.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house, typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on a field with a piece of oil that doesn't stand there.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of the sons and the daughter of Mirza, who have had their grandchildren for a long time.
And the closer you get, the closer you get, the closer you get to two kids.
The kitchen is made of tea, which is placed in the typical sandy shelves of the armud.
At Mirza's ideal level and firm white teeth, she is wearing long dark-haired hair that her son is proud of us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they never fell and kept the color.
"And I've never used a champagne," says Mirzaeva.
Monthly Pension Takes the Lead in Life
She always ate only what grew up in her own yard, furniture, potatoes, cheese.
For the rest of my life, I never bought any products in the store.
Then she tells about her husband who served in the army.
It was more difficult after World War II.
But it's better when the "love father" Guy Aliev got up in his role.
The propaganda does not often sound like the words of an old woman.
However, the culture created around the figure of the father of the nation, which rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan, does not really know the border.
He was in power until 2003, then his son, Ilham, took over the government.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani people.
230 coins (about the same amount of euro) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is the amount for which to live well.
And perhaps the oldest son of Mirzaev also has the right to say, "The history of our culture is deeply respected."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by worry and happiness.
Why Not Keep Living as Long as You Can
The word “human rights” does not appear in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Controversial demonstrations in Cairo testify to the country's deep circle.
The future constitution based on sharia has met with a bitter resurgence.
The Egyptian president didn't gather at the paphos.
We must create a transition.
"And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His words were addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian bishops, liberals, educated by Muslims and nonreligious Egyptians.
However, all of them, who are still hopelessly opposed, experience fear.
Fear of the religious State in the Netherlands for the mercy of the powerful "Muslim Brothers".
Mohammed Mursey, who was apparently not sorry, said that he temporarily breached the constitutional court's competence and expanded his competence "to save the revolution".
However, in fact, the 61-year-old engineer who has a degree of doctor at the University of South California wants to save not fully the Egyptians and the rest of the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, article 234 was able to break into the night of a 15-hour break with restrictions on the Islamic constitutional assembly of 100 participants, which was partly a threat.
As in the previous constitutions, the project states that court production is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was also the case of interpretation, and it could be feared that Islamists would use a broad range of wording and a legal struggle for a more strict interpretation of the Sheria.
At the very least, this included a new article: in all cases concerning the Sheria, the primary Islamic institution of the country used by the greatest authority in all Sunni Islam should be brought to the Council of Al-Ashar.
This may not be necessary, but it may mean that spirituality is under law that de facto would result in a limitation of judicial authority.
The draft constitution is a subject of interpretation.
Another problem is that civilians should remain subject to the military court.
These courts during the period of Mubarak's power served to discourage opposers.
There were up to 11,000 civilians following the conviction of the dictator in the military.
Also, as stated in the draft, the State must maintain “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “the maintenance of its moral and values”.
It has been legally formulated so far that public agencies can control even the content of movies and literature through this article.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
Not one article sets out the exact equality of men and women.
That is why the other is forbidden to anger the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
However, such disappointment and how it must be endured remain unclear.
There is also doubt as to the wording that "manipulating people" is prohibited.
Will the president's cartoons or jokes be sufficient for the court?
The question of interpretation, as well as many in this project, which Morsi proposes on a signature and which, he said, will be presented to the Egyptians at the referendum.
"The revolution is back."
For several weeks, opposition to the superiority of Muslims has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual assembly on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and tried to destroy this document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place in the presidential elections.
Laurent of the Nobel Peace Prize and former leader of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution was a place for "near history".
Due to the short news service, Twitter accused Mursy of wanting to lead the fight against democracy.
"If he declares a referendum, we'll go to his court and take him out," said oppositioner Jasser Said.
"We haven't stopped, our brothers' blood has not been recovered yet," Egypt's media quoted the mass information of the opposition policy of Haled Ali.
Many judges have also reported that they do not want to observe the referendum, which would make it ineffective.
"Koran - our constitution"
The well-organized "Muslim Brothers", in turn, called for an opposite demonstration, but, by caution, not on Tahrir Square, but after Mass prayers on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
She participated in a large number of women under the cover of the Sabbath, who cried out: “The people are demanding the application of God’s law.”
They needed Moses, "Clean the country!" and they said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area, at which all began, provoked the state of virtually civil war.
Detective Mursey, obviously, didn't want to take this risk.
The "Muslim Brothers" said that both the opponents and the sponsors of the draft constitution had expressed themselves in a loud and clear voice.
Now time has come for the people to decide in the electoral forum where the country should go.
The majority of the Islamic project is considered to be a decisive issue.
"Human rights are never mentioned"
The Hafiz Abu Saeda is clear from this forced constitutional process, which, in general, should have been extended until February with all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ECHR) protected "British Muslim" when they were in or before the court in Mubarak.
Not because he has divided their views into world views, but because human rights are not equal to him.
That's why he was shot, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never met in the new constitution, he regrets in the absence of "Well am Sontag".
The increasing influence of Mursi on all three virtues in the State discourages the lawyer.
These measures are a clear impact on the democratic rules of the game and lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“In order to strengthen the civil State, the President de facto cancelled it,” Saeda regrets.
Democracy cannot operate without civil society organizations.
It is now felt that everything has left him, even the international community, which is looking at the ideological fight against the goals of the Nile with a mix of love and pressure.
That's why it's possible to make payments.
"You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norway's Recife: the most stupid fishing in the world?
In the five million Norwegian population, one of the highest levels of life is not only in Europe but also in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success is linked to a local approach to an extremely violent fishing blue?
Take a few red-eyed cheeses.
Put them in a bag of rough and low sports clothes.
Leave them there for a few weeks.
You'll have a false smell of raffic sand, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacys.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but it's different in the air.
Rakfisk is a salt-stained furnace and a water-shiped vessel, depending on what the soul needs to get.
As the summers and the cold are rising, the Norwegians are gathered to the Fagernes festival on the same subject as the blues.
"They eat raw and drink a mixture of aquavit, a local dark water," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local fireman on the profession and the co-operation of the Recife General, who leads the festival.
All around us people eat a little fish-cubic fish and drink it with small portions of the spirit.
"Someone prefers aquavit more than a raffic," Havard says.
It's a drink that's able to survive.
I'm trying a couple of cookies.
If you can get a bag under your nose, it's not that bad, it's a little different than a lot of dry stuff that you've been driving with you in the bus.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when, even before the discovery of refrigerators, the fish had been closed in hermetically closed bottles with salt water.
Then, when the fish had already been well and thoroughly fed, it was taken out of it and, having heard the smell of alcohol, they used it in food.
The fact that thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country in search of work and to migrate mainly to the United States.
More than 13 per cent of the population is currently growing, with jobs, high wages and the development of the social security system.
The inhabitants of Sweden (a former opponent, not yet a long and much more viable neighbor) are often invited to work here.
Ractics is understood as an important symbol, a constant, even a few evil elements in the past of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local flowers.
On the other hand, all the way here - a small cup of beer or sandwich will give you 9 pounds of styrling ($14).
Norway has rarely appeared in world news, and most of the country's inhabitants seem to suffer.
The name Anders Brewik, a racist and extremist right-wing terrorist, has yet to be mentioned in the past year by 77 men, women and children who have been shot and killed.
Not to mention his name, the tract is called "the next 22 July".
Norwegians find it very hard to believe that one of their citizens in their country of peace was capable of such animals and killings.
According to the present benefits of Norway, growth (from the beginning of the 1970s) is one of the world ' s largest oil industries.
"However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says our officer Anna, dispersing the surrogate with a rag, a woman with long bright hair and a bright blue eyes, an act of normal well-being.
We are a people who are called by the name of God.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English.
We don't like to show up, we're not comfortable.
Norway is very careful with its oil, and most of the oil industry's income is invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis when all the money that had not been spent on them was carefully calculated by Norway.
"You can jump on the lakes and walk in the summer, that's good enough for you," says Anna.
"And there's a raffic," she adds with a sudden smile.
I'm in the snow on the edge of some ice -- a raffle with me.
This hamburger with a lot of meat is already an exotic, delicious meat.
But tonight, there's still more fish waiting for us.
In my hotel, special services are carried out on the recuperation, during which visitors determine the best or perhaps the most aromatized fish.
It's going to be a direct telefer that shows the guide in the baobac glass surrounded by raffic wires.
It looks like a song competition, Eurovision.
"So, Tor-Yurgen, what assessment have you put for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our evaluation."
They all laugh and cry.
Someone's falling out of a chair, maybe I've got some coffee.
And maybe it's just a smell of that fish.
President of Mexico Enrique Pjeya It is not easy to start a career.
As soon as the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Pjeja Nuto, is ready to enter the post, the BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he has to face and the mixed expectations of his people.
The road movement in Mexico is now in a particularly painful state.
The city was overloaded by transport and in the best time, and from Monday, there were permanent damages from several key magistrates to the capital and the chaos on the streets.
This was done, however, not to allow people to work out of their wages, but to mix protests with parliament building.
In the resurrection, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Pjeya, will take over the presidency and assume the honour of the country's government.
There's an unusual task ahead of him.
Mexico has received good economic indicators at the administration of Felipe Calderona, which is now exercising its powers, but the country has been involved in the fight against drugs, which has taken some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government declares to the people of Mexico its willingness to fight violence,” Mr. Pjeja Newe told the president of the United States Barako Obama at the White House headquarters this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to those statements, the political career of Mr. Pjeja Nuto, along with the president of the United States, developed as the governor of his country of Mexico.
In his family, the views of the new leader were shared in a hostile and expanding state of the country’s capital.
The Premolitic Person
In the idyllic city of Valé de Bravo, for example, they remember him with heat.
Residents are responsible for the preservation of tourism, the development of the Kurt area and the establishment of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new six built by Mr. Panja Nito, who are different from the streets and the areas that were previously in this place.
Tables with its name refer to the modern building of the sports centre and the impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We share the hope of real and serious changes," said his friend and political associate Gabriel Olver Ernandes, Congressman of the Pjeja Nito institutional and revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to these and decisive changes that our country so urgently needs, primarily in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay at the authority of the PRI party, Vicente Fox was dismissed in 2000.
After his 12-year absence in the Presidential Court of Los Pinos, Congressman Olvera acknowledges that the party has given much hope to Enrique Pjeja Nito.
In addition, he investigated the allegations of insatiableness that the new opposition president had made.
He was very friendly and very informed about his vision of the future country.
It is an extreme public worker, and, above all, a man with the ability to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people had another idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkootl, also known as the City of Ness, is the most frequent contrast with the powerful streets of Valé de Bravo.
In many ways, it is the reward of Mexico itself.
The problems in the municipality also pose a serious threat to this megapolis.
Earlier this year, the gang of drug dealers in these areas was involved in the military; violence against women was particularly severe here.
Only a few tens of dead women have been found on the ground in the last two years.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during the rule of Mr. Pjeja Nut - a significant increase in the viciously celebrated violence in the city of Ciudad Huures, whose name was Nazi when it came to the killing of innocent women.
According to Mr. Pjeja Nito's opponents, it is best to say that during his stay as Governor, he was unable to deal with the problem of women ' s murder.
At the same time, his administration was accused of fully ignoring the problem.
The concrete housekeeper, who seemed to be most of the houses in the surrounding area, Irinaa Budedia was working hard to hold her tears by showing me pictures of her peaceful daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to Mariana's official version, suicide took place in 2010.
But her family thinks she killed her husband.
"When I came to her house, it seemed like her body had gone out before," said Mrs. Budden.
It was evidence that she was killed, and the body was already dead.
The mother of Mariana tells the story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where she walks through a series of sentences, with the same word: justice.
That is, they say, the family was denied.
"The officials of the state approached me as with an old plaintiff, a non-smoker of peace.
They want people to simply accept everything they say and reduce it.
But that's not right, so I can't, especially when I'm surrounded by so many violations and shortcomings," she says.
In hopes of a presidential transfer on Saturday, President Pjeya Nuto will take on a difficult responsibility along with her.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence, and the new President has promised to address the problem as a priority during his rule.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as the governor," says Oliver, a congressman from Vale de Bravo of the PRI party.
However, this is the most dangerous of the victims' families in the city of Niss.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about bad treatment, he complained.
The prosecutors are trying to investigate Bradley Manning's statements on the bad conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to the presence of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection is required to close the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manninga ' s conclusion were cruel.
A number of thousands of secret documents have been charged by the United States Army.
On Friday it was tried to prove that a number of Bradley Manning, who was charged with the greatest escape of classified material in the history of the United States, had not used much of the opportunity to complain about ill-treatment, which he said had been sent to military prison.
During a re-examination of the hearing in Fort-Mide, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein, stated that the records of weekly visits to Manning by the officials of the prison administration for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
A cross-cutting inquiry in the context of the examination of the request for protection of the termination of the Manninga case based on the fact that the conditions of his detention were cruel and himself had been punished enough on the following day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in custody.
A military expert on the analysis of disclosure data, arrested in June 2010, was charged with stealing several thousand secret documents during Iraq's service.
This material was later published on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, reviewed the reports completed after the visits of the representatives of the administration of Manning, during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was in the harsh conditions of the conclusion from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visit, the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about the records, Manning acknowledged that he appreciated being treated by the prison administration as a “privileged” and that the general conditions of the conclusion were “highly professionally organized”.
The reports considered do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, although Manning has directly questioned the conditions of his detention, says Fein.
Manning replied that he expressed his deep concern about these issues and that his visiting representatives had discussed these issues with him and said that they would do so, but not in writing.
"They wrote "no problems" (after the discussion of my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this issue in vain," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about mistreatment with him in January 2011 at a meeting of the Commission, considering the social intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that he wanted to get rid of the "prevention of trauma" regime at the time of the meeting and to mitigate the conditions of the conclusion.
Military leaders explained that the restricted detention regime, at the lower level than the surveillance regime, for the prevention of suicide, was introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm all in order to give up the anti-traumatic regime... to improve the level of my life, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to prison at the military base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that his thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that he once lost consciousness because of a strong complaint.
He explained that it was very psychologically difficult when they didn't let you know how your participation was resolved and what was happening in the outside world.
"My world fell to the base of Camp Arafjan, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, he spent most of his time in a small room, at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours in a single room.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only matras, clothes, shoes, a few items of clothing and shoes.
He says that he tried to move, such as to sleep or even to sleep at a certain time.
According to Manning, during his dream, he had always been a light shining through the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he was in the dark of the night, they would certainly have made him turn back on their heels.
Maninga's lawyer filed an official complaint about maltreatment with Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he had made during the fourth round, that after one night he was allowed to sleep in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand in front of the guards and other prisoners in the morning check.
Manning said he had no way to cover his clothes during the check.
In response to the judges' questions on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the security officer's order that he should burn a garment that could be closed, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to be burned.
On Thursday, Manning stated that the previous night, he was forced to sleep deep because of his attempt to show the officer that he did not pose a threat to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could use a rose or slag risk to harm himself, but he didn't.
On that night, he was taken from the camera by the meninga, his lower whites, the sleeks, and the hats.
Its lawyers hope that the judge, at least, will take into account what has been done to him during his detention, and will significantly reduce the time of his arrest if Manning is recognized by the military court, which should begin his case at the beginning of the following year.
Protection stated that it was planned to invite Manning to acknowledge the guilt for less serious crimes and other charges to be dealt with as excessive.
The renewal of the hearing was planned for these exits, and the party expected to insist that the conditions of detention had been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the content of the arrests with a maximum strict regime.
The charges raised by Manning include the prosecution of the opponent, the unlawful promotion of data on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is convicted of all the points of the indictment, he may be threatened by a life sentence.
My crisis of national self-determination is the report of the American of Mexican origin.
In the author's view, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of their lack of ability to realize themselves.
The Mexicans are willing to blame those who have gone away because they remind the people of the hard times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are divided between two cultures.
During a recent visit to Mexico, I went to the corridor for visitors, approached the border control area, and stopped at the site.
The signs were shown on two lines: one for Mexicans (Mexico), one for Foreigners (foreigners).
I've been standing before them for a few seconds, I don't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life was called a Mexican.
It's just a common name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think themselves Italian.
Later, I stopped at the complex design of the American of Mexican origin.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's family, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the language bearers, and I can't get out of America's accent.
That's why I got my American passport and became an alien.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Pjeya, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda was prepared for the meeting of the Presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pjeja Nuto spoke enthusiastically about the support of the Mexican economy, which now enables Mexicans to remain in Mexico, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trade block like the Euro-Union.
In addition, President Pjeja Nuto promised to continue the war against drug dealers in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are difficult and difficult to deal with.
Most Americans had never imagined that the United States had entered Mexico in 1848 and under the window had forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and they see memories of those events everywhere.
Therefore, it is only a matter of public action by the United States that despite the criticism of Mexico, the press and the media of Mexican society are still complaining that Americans are under the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the Montesusum descendants are committed to war.
Meanwhile, Mexico's relationships with more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States are the most difficult.
You want to talk about the trials?
They're good enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers who are in this country for themselves and those who have no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin only for one reason: at some point in their family history, anyone - a father or a grandfather - had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of all, it was Mexicans of a certain type - soft, low-educated, poor Christian families.
We're their descendants, and we'll remember about that.
That's different in Mexico.
Today, our life is a set of American dreams, we've learned in good schools and we've got a good job, but we don't forget that even that dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is misleading and unclear, but we know which country to think of.
United States of America.
We also know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer the same question.
They remind us of the devastating injuries and concern us as individuals of the second kind, as do those of the Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Only our existence for them is doomed to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
We would no longer be in a wheelchair to find a living in the United States but to lose spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalahara and moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me of the fact that there are certain lessons among Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and that is difficult for Mexicans.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my well-known Americans of Mexican origin feel no belonging to one of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springs.
If you get the best out of the two worlds, you're definitely losing your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I have explained during my visit, as our relations were not sufficiently delayed, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexicans of origin to work their kind with Mexican envoys and to represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country is and how to visit it well, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
There's nothing going on.
Too much effort in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the spread of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be such a wonderful one.
I'm sorry, but you're gonna understand that, Imagos.
And that's fair.
If a part of Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States for their failure to join Mexico the 13th century ago, they should also accept the fact that some of the Americans of Mexican origin are still trying to get together with their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
Please, we have more general than I've been told.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas Group can be a weak foundation for further peace
Can a lasting peace be achieved between the Arabs and the Israelites in the Middle East?
The genuine round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are worthy of consideration.
The usual, unintended disputes about who was the first one; many buildings were turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians were killed, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; first in the period of the conflict from the Gaza Strip, the rockets fell into the ruins of the capital of Israel Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians were hopelessly involved in their eternal conflict, changes had taken place in the Middle East.
This can be seen in a different way, but the events of the Arab news have surrounded many of the realities that lie ahead, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to remain on the side of the desolate region.
As a result, their fight may become even more bloodthirsty than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for the exit of this deadly trap.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the end of the fire, signed on 21 November, will be carried out, which took place this week, only strengthened the position of the two parties.
The leaders of the Islamic Movement of Hamas, who arrived in the Gaza Strip in 2007, claim that they had forced Israel to give up despite their losses.
Despite the destruction of some of the leaders of the groups and 1.7 million of the population were blocked in one of the most hostile and troubled corners of our planet, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas has increased its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River — another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fath movement.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders may come to the conclusion that time is working for them.
As Islamist movements in the Arab world grew, Hamas developed new influential and rich friends.
The growing regional leader of Turkey, who was once the closest Union of Israel to the Muslim countries, expressed support for Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
The supporters of Hamas claim the establishment of an Islamic semi-monthly Israeli round of Israel, from Lebanon to the north, in which the armed group of Hezbollah, to Syria, where the more pro-histism rebels are forced to undermine the authority of Basar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities threaten Hamas' allies.
The most significant change in the balance of the force in the region occurred at the southern borders of Israel, in the most hostile and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the movement of the Muslim Brethren was strengthened by President Muhammad Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was imprisoned in 2011, was a world dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas' support.
In contrast, the Muslim brothers are organizations, much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic districts, Hamas can become a major game that the voice will not be able to silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, the yellow line parties in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In the military, Hamas was committed.
The Israeli anti-ractate system, the Iron Curtain, has justified its creation and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas rockets.
Israel's citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained neutral; many European countries also blamed for the beginning of the last round of violence in Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly with the Government of Biniamin Netanija, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although about 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets released from the Gaza Strip since 2004, Israel has been able to address the minimum problem of terrorists of deaths, partly because of the wall, which runs on the west coast of the Jordan River, a large part of the unknown Palestinian State, and protects Jewish populations that continue to grow despite the illegality of such acts in the context of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanijau, whose party, Likod, as part of the preparations for the 22 January elections, was accompanied by an even more aggressive conservatory under the leadership of Avigidor Liberman.
What did it mean to create Palestinians and give them their own State?
If they put all their power into their hands on the West Bank territory, would they not start to launch rockets in Israel, as they gather in the Gaza Strip?
It would be better to keep them under the wall and make every effort to raise their heads.
It is possible that the "green" lines will win; however, their calculations may be distorted by the Arab flag.
While Muslims who come to power in Egypt and other countries are not experiencing the hottest feelings of Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence budget of Israel is greater than all its Arab neighbours, together.
The strengthening of the war with the regional sovereignty would hardly help the Governments of the Arab countries to strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, who worked with Barak Obama for the end of the fire, was a good sign and could be known as the beginning of the change.
Israel, at least, must take into account the long-term implications of its policy.
As democratic change takes place in Arab countries, the denial of the right of Palestinians to self-determination is a bomb of delayed action, which is either early or late in the occupied territories of Israel, such as the bus station in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already undermines the foundations of the democratic regime in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect of the growth of the Arab population is only aggravating these problems.
Bloodless operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to force the Hamas movement have to be paid for the growing ill-treatment of the international community.
Both sides need an external force
The only solution remains to which health-sustaining representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are the education of two States and Israel's entry into the territory for security.
It is hoped that, not too short-term, that the end of the fire will allow other countries to have a more effective impact on the side of the conflict.
Egypt, which had long decided to close the arms supply supply in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, had never had a useful position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State, which had been adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to calm the movements of Hamas and Fath.
This would have done more to establish a Palestinian State than the forthcoming United Nations vote, which could lead to the recognition of the virtual State of Palestine.
In order to raise Israel to the negotiating table, President Obama must also play his part.
During his first term, he did not present his own plan of peace.
After his return to the White House, he continued to demonstrate his refusal to join in the settlement of the problem.
It's a catastrophic invisible position.
The United States is deeply interested in the stability of the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, a unified cigarette package was introduced into force.
The warning against smoking and imagery of damaged parts of the body is contrasted with those of isolated green shells that are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first international law on a single pack of cigarettes and tobacco products entered into force by replacing logos and colouring of different brands of the same single-ovable colour box with yellow photographs of the diseased body and images of children affected by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions that warn of the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages made mandatory from this Saturday is the name of the marks printed by the same small font.
These are the worst conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, leaving this harmful habit of fashion status.
Based on such a decision, the results of studies showed that people who did not start smoking until 26 years of age were 99 of 100 who never became smokers.
"It is obvious that even in the youth age, children understand the meaning of the tobacco companies' attempting to produce packages," Minister of Health Tanya Plyberseck explains, referring to studies showing that, for example, coron is closely associated with children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the world's lowest number of smokers, so these changes do not necessarily refer to the arrival of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tax companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cash and available cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have a serious effect on those who were thinking of it by its sponsors," says Scott McKinter, representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
China and Indonesia will provide a lot of such goods for sale on Australian streets.
On the contrary, new laws help to grow business.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for portfolios and silico-fottlers covering undesirable pictures on packaging, has increased dramatically (actually with zero) over two months ago, such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, has lost a case in Australia's high court where they tried to appeal to this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already carried out some six thousand goods for general trade companies and is expecting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential mix for the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks among them, namely the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws making illegal television advertising and supporting sports activities, as well as prohibiting sales of cigarettes, the advertising of tobacco products has moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has prohibited local companies and websites from placing advertising on the network, but it cannot restrict it to this foreign site.
"If you're selling tobacco products and you've only got this little lie, the idea of moving your goods on the Internet is very misleading," explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman notes the increase in the number of commercial brands written by a number of ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the case of a number of citizens who so much like the Marlboro cigarette, who didn't ask for power and time and made a video, or is it a advertising company?
The Australian Company Office of British American Tobacco claims that the sector is now more adapted to new rules than to advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to dispute new rules: these States claim under the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfair, although trade relations with all these countries are very insignificant with Australia.
WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plyberseck, the Government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada first introduced the mandatory placement of pictures that warn of the harm of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of law enforcement is discussed in Britain, New Zealand, the U.S.A. and India.
The majority of smokers in Australia are undeterred by news.
These pictures don't interest me.
I just don't pay attention.
"You just take a cigarette and put a pack in the cart," explains Victor El Heig, who bought cigarettes with a picture of a mouth half of the pack.
I'm honest, the only thing that can keep me going is my little girl.
James You, who holds the King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, claims that the same package has made it difficult to distribute the goods by parcels
"I used to have a new party, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and prohibit cigarettes altogether, and then we would say, "All right, we're closing the store," he says, waving his hands up.
To hit electronic networks and permanent connections in the world is not that bad.
On that day of thanking me, I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had detected mechanical defects and replaced them with other planes we were waiting for.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of the snake.
I won't lie to you.
Sunday at the airport waiting for the train is really boring, and there are no books, magazines, iPhones, or even shops of illicit trafficking.
In recent times, however, more and more scientists and child development specialists have benefited.
They say that in certain situations we and our children are not that bad.
This causes the brain to draw attention to interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world, we're all always in front of any screen, the advantages of the shoes are coming from us.
Could it be that we need to try to jump?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We're still going back to that.
I used to think, like many, that the taste was a little bit of a short time ago when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history of the University of Calgary, author of the book "Lead History of Skulls" (Boredom: A Living History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, the taste can be appreciated by very old history," he says.
Latin inscriptions of the first century have been found on the walls of Pompey.
The question of how we understand the taste remains open.
The problem is that John D. Ishid, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, says that understanding and seeing taste have often changed.
Having studied research materials on this subject and asked the task force for 100 people, Professor Ishid and his colleagues came to the next definition: a shock when people "want, but they can't take what would bring them satisfaction".
The difference between taste and appetite, he says, is that the squeaking person does not do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything about it.
Mainly in the surviving taste, he says that it is “a violation of the attention and the associated deterioration of the mood and feeling that time is running slowly.”
The taste can be very similar to the depression described.
However, Professor Ishitid contends that despite the possible link between these conditions, people who suffer from problems in the world and under conditions and people who experience depression find problems in themselves.
Sometimes we're told that it's a shame when we really find it hard to focus on something.
In his study “The Low Mind: Determination of the Eye of Attention”, published in the September issue of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Ishid and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment by which participants listened to the recorded vote of the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the TV program in the neighboring room, others heard the same sound at low volume, so that they could hardly be discussed, and only the third group heard a recorded voice without a sidewalk.
Those who heard television with low volume noticed that it was sweet, often difficult for others to focus, but they didn't know why and did not sign it.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, the interruption may cause shock, says Mark J. Fenceke, a neurology professor at the University of Golfa, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something that is not interesting, "for example, looking at converge products in search of a marriage, music can help to avoid shocks."
It is believed that when people start to climb on the table or to cut the trucks on the bookboard, they do so from the shower, but now we know that in fact, such actions simply help not to weaken physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not forbidden to eat and return are learning better and forgetting more information than children who are required to sit quietly,” says Professor Fence.
At some point, we all have a taste: at the end of the trip (as in my case), listening to a monotonous thing, watching an uninterested movie.
However, various people demonstrate a different degree of resistance to sugar.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special "square-square" scale to measure these individual characteristics.
In order to determine this scale evaluation, questions and approvals are used, for example, "Many of what I have to do is uniformly and monotonous" or "I'm too interested, so I don't have enough time."
With the help of such researchers, researchers have found that boys are becoming more and more girls, says Steven Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly with different external players.
In general, however, adolescents often fall apart.
In 1991, Reid Larson, a professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment that involved nearly 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day.
The following results were obtained: 32 per cent of adults said that they were good at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said that they were bad outside the school.
Only 3 per cent of parents noticed that they were having a good time.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on what such shock data would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “ages tend to fall into shocks” mainly because children and adults do not fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my first question: is the juice good?
Sometimes it does not, as studies show, cause people to resort to absurd and dangerous physical activities, to a risk of gambling, or to abuse certain substances in an attempt to escape the smoke.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have wondered about the link between taste and creation, says Professor Vodanovic, who has been dedicated to studying this problem for more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that something else should be done; it's a shock," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
However, the brain itself does not always know what to do.
If you're going to be boring and you're going to make this energy on a guitar or culinary experience, you'll do better.
But if you get to watch TV, you'll get better for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So if your child jumps and you give him an iPad, he'll stop kicking, but he won't learn to fight it alone or somehow manage his time and work," said Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulatory skills are being undertaken in the most diverse situations”, he says.
Your child learns not only to do something on his own but also to learn self-control at all.
I don't think I need to carry something.
But it's not good to think it's bad, either.
It is time to learn to feel comfortable even without a constant flow of action and technology.
Professor Ishid agrees with that.
"We see it so that we need to test the taste more often, while the taste is very unpleasant, the inexhaustible desire to do something reasonable," he says.
In fact, people are trying to avoid constant anxiety and just get tired.
"In today's world, we've been accustomed to a constant overstimulation of the senses," he says, "and when the silence comes, we're tired and we don't know what to do."
As long as the new law on the legalization of marijuana will be applied in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team and a student of the public college in the southeastern state of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be legally committed throughout the state: keeping a small portion of the marijuana and garbage in which he burned it.
Mr. Orosco said that once in September he and his friends were in Lamara and drove to a car to cross the border with Kansas when they were stopped by the police.
After the police discovered in Marhiwan, Mr. Orosko brought a report to the court on the use of drugs and the use of a small crime, each of which was charged with a fine of $100 - and appointed a date of the trial meeting.
"They call us criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which continues a few weeks after the state of Colorado has voted for the legalization of the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of minor cases does not depend on the law as much as on the place of consideration.
The allegations of small crimes involving marijuana have already been filed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, which has taken similar action.
Police have already stopped accusing people at 21 years of age and older than keeping small doses, which will be considered legal only after a couple of weeks of the law enters into force.
However, in the more conservative areas of Colorado, the prosecutors decided to consider existing cases related to marijuana and have previously attracted responsibility for the preservation of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, they vote in order not to allow the presence in their premises of new, licensed shops for the sale of marijuana.
"It all develops so hard that I don't even know what to expect," says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in the city of Auroora in eastern Denver.
The representatives of the control bodies in Washington, D.C., have also been assigned to honour their heads.
They should develop rules to determine the licensing procedure for the development, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all necessary to do so by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, either good or bad, has exceeded most other states in resolving the use of marijuana, has begun for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado a more orderly market, so they serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Governing Council for the Production and Production of Alcohol in Washington.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith acknowledges that it is better to make proposals and hope that this will work.
"We don't have this president we could focus on," he says.
The Law of Washington, I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will enter into force for the entire year in a state of uncertainty when the public licensing system is no longer in existence, and the right of the ruler of the capital has already been legalized.
There are still other simple technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, for example, to find a balance between the State ' s provision of adequate access to licensed marijuana with a ban on trade for 1,000 feet from school, parks, playgrounds and children's gardens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed Marhivan trade companies in cities, particularly in Seattle and its capitals,” explains Ben Livingstone, a recently established research group representative of the Marhiuan Law Centre.
On 21 November, police chief Outs of Aurora sent to his staff by e-mail a message that the city's prosecutor would no longer attract 21-year-olds to the responsibility for the small number of marhiwans and that the police would cease to keep the people out of these violations “from now on”.
The chief of police said that the police would monitor the city's compliance with the rules governing the activities of those who develop marijuana for medical purposes and prosecute illegal drug dealers and drug dealers.
The prosecutor of the Vold District in northern Colorado, Ken Bak, represents a more serious approach to this issue.
Following a vote on the bill, he stated that the prosecutor would continue to be responsible for the possession of the Marhivan, mainly in order to encourage its users to attend the course of treatment.
At the present time, 119 persons have been charged with the detention of two and less ovaries, although many of them have been charged with other violations.
"The obligation of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their execution," Mr. Bak said in his statement.
Even in areas such as the rural area of Mesa, where the vote was rejected by the parties on the law of marijuana.
The Grand Jancshn police, the largest city in the district, no longer attract the responsibility of young adults to have a small amount of drugs.
The District Prosecutor, Peter Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to record charges of open cases relating to the detention of marijuana.
"I think that to ensure compliance with the law until it changes - our direct responsibility," he says.
Despite the fact that 55 per cent of the population of Colorado who participated in the vote supported this decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system would not be easy.
In contrast, the reaction of the people in various parts of the state has increased the disparity between local authorities and the experiment with marijuana.
“In the district prosecutors there is a cultural barrier in this regard”, explains Sean McCalister, a German lawyer who represents the interests of the judges in the custody of Marhiwan and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of the Laws on Marhiwan.
"They have persecuted people for so long that they can't now calm down because it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first countries in which the small number of marijuana are related to alcohol are destined to become an experimental field at country level to check the very idea of drug law.
Legalization parties and government officials are planning to expand the territory of legitimate trade, but at the same time they are looking forward to instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to consider the sale and development of marijuana as a federal offence.
The legislators hope that the Office of Justice will handle the matter.
Despite the wide range of arrests of traders and patients using marijuana on medical evidence, the federal government has, in most cases, benefited from the trafficking of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries.
The Bureau of Drug Control will not be able to break into the house to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they will hardly close the eyes of the regulated authorities of the State of Recycling marijuana, which is permitted under the new law, says Kevin A. Sabiet, former anti-drug consultant in Obama's administration.
Some cities in Colorado have failed to wait for federal authorities to act.
Prior to the presidential elections, some local authorities approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops that could not be opened earlier than a year.
Last week, Montrous, a town in the western part of the state, issued a six-month ban on Marhivan trade, which is most likely to be approved on the following week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we give someone a license, and then this will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our town voted against this amendment.
And now we have a conflict between the results of the local vote and what the state has voted for.
There are still a lot of unsolicited issues.
Petronella Whitet: I've survived Oxford because I'm a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views has not begun today.
As long as I remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother had studied in Oxford and described him as the best educational institution in the world, a modern anti-Symposium model that has two foundations for civilization - freeness and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the historic college of the University of Oxford College at the end of the eighth century, I got tired and went to the first scandal in my life.
My father didn't hold and cry.
The friends were cut off so much.
The Evening Standard admitted that I had dropped a college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the neighboring room.
Author E. Norman Wilson made fun of me because I had to drink some of the sugarcane.
Actually, it wasn't that fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was being hit and scared.
Not because of my unusual name or what I've learned in private school.
I was persecuted for just one reason, and in this glorious triumphal procession, it seemed to me to be this veneer and dark fantasy: my father, now late Woodro White, was a well-known consultant, Margaret Tetcher, and I was the conservatory myself.
You're asking why you remember this now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students with the right-wing perspectives is affected by the same trauma.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred for the students in Oxford was so strong that a group of such students had to protect their rights in the past week, such as those granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the school club of Corpus Cristi, Cambridge, claim that they “are often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and are forced to feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They would like to introduce a colleague to the Committee on Equal Rights to ensure the freedom of expression of their views.
Their situation has only made it worse on BBC 2 a documentary film on student policy on the “Staff: Young, smart and right” in which conservatives have been presented by excentrators and non-unazisists.
The film showed Joe Cook, former president of the Association of the Conservatives of Oxford University, who is traveling to Rolls-Royse, wearing a silver suit and playing with a Serbian conservatory.
In other universities, students are complaining that they are "cause of a loss of education".
Luke Black, a 20-year-old Vice-President of the Association of Conservatives of the Nottingham University, said in an interview with one of the resurrected newspapers that "in the university environment, there is an increase in cross-reference on the left.
People who do not even know us before consider us to be foolish and undeterred by the parents of the rich."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the College of History of Corpus Cristi, in which an appeal was made to strengthen the protection, calls for such an atmosphere “unsatisfied”, and 19-year-old Stefani Cherill, the new president of the Association of the Conservatives of Oxford University, says that the relationship between the student clubs to the right-centrers was greatly weakened.
"This represents a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just a minority, I was one.
I arrived there in September 1986, working with an 80 - year - old girl.
Oxford escaped hate to a conservative party.
Last year, the university voted in favour of former student Margaret Tetcher, whose initial degree was due to a reduction in budget allocations for higher education.
Even Stalinists would be in such an atmosphere.
On the first day of the first week of high school, when the students met each other and with teachers, I first felt that I was looking forward.
I still didn't know that the teachers not only saw the rings on the student-conservative tract but also willingly participated in it.
Political issues, such as harassment, privatization and the Government's refusal to apply sanctions against the Government of the apartheid in the UAR, have broken through the vast wooden walls of the audience.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Whitet," said the teacher, now late Harry Pitt, - please translate the first paragraph."
The text gave me work, I stopped.
Harry Pittt was a very kind man with a face like a cake.
"The teachers don't usually learn French or just don't understand their brains?" he asked.
The other students were in a hurry.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few basic lessons from French at a time free, if you are, of course, not very busy going back to society," Peter added.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I sat next to dinner, and then someone grabbed me by my back.
It was James, a student of the second course from the English language school, who was represented as a member of the Association of Conservatives of the University.
"I know who you are," he said in a friendly manner.
Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone who suspects the conservators will be betrayed.
I don't think it's easy for me, but in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Tetcher, so you're gonna get more complicated.
Most of the first-class conservators are pretending to be librarians."
Later, in the local pope, I tried hard to escape.
I insisted on not everything Margaret Tetcher says.
The temperature didn't work out.
The first professor of philosophy, politics and economy, who learned in Estonia, said, "You're a daughter of a fascist pig.
You're infected."
Other students supported his words.
I was fired, broken.
"How do the conservators deal with sex?" - He asked one of them.
- They drive each other, right?"
I felt as though I had been homosexuals before the end of criminal persecution in the six hundred years.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with the same guys only under cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a liberarian and hide my beliefs?
For three years, I have been told by ad, full of injuries and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only because he belonged to the conservators but also because he was an adviser to Tetcher on foreign policy and one of its sponsors.
He didn't show up in college.
He preferred it for the provinciality, mercenary and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took a professional position at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started building in Oxford from a home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unforeseeable capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his school years, there were political views there.
"But that's the best university in the world," he said sadly.
- It's not possible there, it's just not in the city of the burning arrows...
Even my friends and communists always say themselves forever."
He's got his eye fixed on it.
"Don't make quick decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you break the university."
I was overwhelmed by constant visits to London and my emotional protection was weakened.
My friend, as well as the conservator, did not give up and give up his beliefs.
The next week at the seminar, when the real teacher of history called me "a friend of the people", I decided to do the same.
In my heart burning with shame, I admitted that my parents had broken my brains, and I called them "old dolls."
It's been a while.
The last train in my career in Oxford was about to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for copies belonging to Rupert Merdock.
My door was closed.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my pursuers left.
When they left, I picked up a boat and a village on the first trip to London.
I haven't come back yet.
You can call me a platoon and a triangle.
But in the 1980s, no one should be subjected to such violence and threats at school.
It is even more serious that it was Oxford, who not only released the forty prime ministers of the Towers, but is still hiding behind the unencumbered reputation of the university, where they value equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentinally prefers the elegance of glory."
On the exhibition "Valentino: Master Chitya", which was opened this week in London, ABC met with Nati Abakal, Fio Tissen-Bornemica and other well-known Italian designer clients
Somerset House, former residence of King Elizabeth I of England, the only place in the British capital worthy of the exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this at the time of the opening of Valentino: master of the chain, a triumphine retrospective exhibition that combines more than 130 high fashions created by his "house" over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his inseparable Italian accent.
This exhibition is a final part of the story, the only person who is "Ill Signor" Garawani, but it could not be written without his so-called clients.
Valentino has always been awed by a rare and far - reaching knowledge.
In the first room of the exhibition, opened by 3 March, personal letters and photographs were purchased for the signature of the most famous aristocracys, from the Princess Salima Ag-Han to Lord Snoudona, including Mary-Shantal, the Princess of Greece, and Margaret, the Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of its social support: from a modest port from the city of Voger in northern Italy to an international "elite".
To be loved in the royal court, there's nothing wrong with that.
"They don't even smell their cigarettes about your great cover, as some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baron Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in Alpa and were good friends.
Valentino is an infamous businessman and accepts guests with generosity and elegance.
"We were all very pleased to visit his palace in Gstaade," explains an ex-wife "Hinni" Tissen, a close friend of the forgotten beauty of Marella Angeli or Evgen Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of glory.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Magya representing Valentine
The Argentina model Valeria Maye mentions a charismatic model.
Once we went to work for him at his house, it was after a fashion show in Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy.
The style of Valentino appeared in everything - in every detail of his room, in her dress, in her dress, in music.
"Every guest of Valentino has made himself feel important and desirable," recalls the top model, which began with a model in 1995 during the high fashion week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion, because his scissors are this art production," she concludes.
Birthdays & Anniversaries
Garawani's life is not a story of possessions, but of love that is fully intertwined.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House's gallery was converted into a six hundred metres-long glamorous floor that offers a change of role: the visitor takes the place of models and has to defecate through the floor, the "swifters" cut-outs from the grass that surrounds the cedars of Valentino, such as the payment that Jaclyn Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Whitty used in "Nochi", or the shirt and leather that belonged to the Emperor Fara Diba.
In this model publication, names such as Sibila Luxembourg, Gloria Foon Tourn and Taxis, Matte-Mariet from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg are published.
Naty Abscal and Modeller in 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentine's first love is the first love to be forgotten.
I remember him very well.
It was a rock, a cave, a jillet, and it likes from the 1971-1972 summer collection.
"It was a gift he made me," says Natalie Abscal, one of the museum designers.
"I consider him to be the rest of his femininity, his greater love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," added the former Georgian de Ferria.
I love the colors he uses: they have a lot of light, and they're "appropriate" to his face.
The ratios are ideal.
Princes and legislator of Patricia's fashion Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she went to Valentino.
When I was a teenager and living in Italy, I thought I'd have an age and a reason to trust one of his evening toilets...
He finally came to the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first ticket from Valentino to put it on a holiday in the close of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a nice deal, with a pair of boots, a "corrosion" in the box and an expression without a brothel.
"It was a dream that turned out to be," says the widow of Rodrigo Dr. Arenberg.
"Valently equal to fashion, his passion is temporary," explains this Italian aristocracy, which lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday pay from the model with "Maximum caution... because the pay is not just a pay, it's also a set of memories that accompany it."
King's Mode
The great final exhibition in Summersett House is the Mari-Shantal Miller wedding for her wedding with Paulos from Greece in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "girls" were required (as the model of their shoes) to produce this piece of a sludge-coloured sludge with an incrustration of grass, twelve different rounds and a sleigh in four with a half meters.
According to journalist Suzi Menques, the highest authority of the specialized press, the payment is a very high fashion at the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers from the highest world".
For many years, the "style of life" of the elite, now Valentino himself, is the best representative of it.
Cavaler of the Great Cross (the symbol of the highest rank in Italy), Cavaler of the work, Commander of the Order of Arts and Speech, awarded by the Order of the Home Law, Garawani collected as many honours as any of his clients.
"I have always been attracted to his sweetness, his calmness, his exact and unforgettable appearance," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
Last time I saw him, I saw him last month at a funeral in the Orse Museum.
He's sitting on the table with a graph of Jaclin de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, there's no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: chess with Kavah-Ygena
In four euros, Indonesian sugars risk life and health by weighing 70 kilograms of serum at the top of the volcano on a hard stone troppa
There are people for whom their work is from, and others are working literally in the field.
Among them is Anto Vijayya, one of the 400 chessmen who are working for the life of the coming series in the Kavah-Ijun volcano located on the east side of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the greenhouse gas rising from the depths of the Earth remains in contact with the air.
Around the huge series of shells, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, it puts them in two bubbles, lifts the roots on the floor, and carries them up on the narrow stone road.
The height of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres high, is only 250 metres, but it takes more than 40 minutes for capable passengers to take a sharp step, with work to maintain balance and guard the road so that they do not fall and fall off the coast.
They know that an unfaithful step could cost them their lives, as happened to a tourists from France who had suffered a few years ago from the Kawah-Ygen Valley.
Kavah-Igena has 5 Euro cents per kilogram of cheese they get
On top of that, they travel their way between the tourists who photograph them, as if they were surrounded by circuses and there were no heavy roots, walking three kilometers to the grass that the top-ranking company had located at a height of 1,850 metres.
It is about PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company operating this volcano since 1960 and, better yet, not to say, its employees who pay 662 Indonesian rubies (5 Euro cents) per kilogram of cheese.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Euros) of petroleum products, since it is distributed in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of spices, perfumes, cosmetics, dynamics and even for the labelling of sugar.
"As usual is 70 kilograms of transportation, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and finally feels broken, but they allow him to buy 138,000 euros (11,5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it is a mystery to such an inhuman effort, it is a third more than it would have worked in the field.
"The pay for the skitters is very high on local measures where the coffee collection costs 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is equal to two million rupees (167 euros), " - explains a merchant who previously worked as a stoneman on the tourist island of Bali.
There he paid 75,000 rupees (EUR 6.2) a day and a lot was not that heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banjuangi, a city near the volcano, for a heavy reason that in Indonesia is the same as Syria: "I married a girl from Bali, where one Indian, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
At Anto asthma, he's working hard, he's always screaming, and he's got his eyes down because of toxic gases.
At his 27 years of age, Anto was at risk in Kavah-Ygen, whose sister had already begun to abuse him despite the presence of masks and special shocks.
He's got an asthma, he's got a job, he's always crying, and his eyes are down because of the toxic gases that separate the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I've been working for two more years, because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises more than an English-friendly.
The punishment for life, this pleasant and smart young man could be a tourist guide, officer or port in the hall, but instead he is doing the work of the mob.
The part of a rough wooden hygiene with other carriers is set up every day at two in the night, because the lake does not stop running through the night when its characteristic yellow color turns into deep and cloudy.
Breaking his teeth, Anto falls into the crater, lighting himself up the path of a small firm attached to his pocket, which he bought himself for his money.
About 400 passengers sat on the ground with a lot of rice on their shoulders with a bottom of the volcano
Despite high revenues, the mining company did not mechanism the profit of the economy and did not provide any equipment to carriers working on its account and with such losses.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of 30,000 pieces (2.5 euros) of a photo collection, which, along with an input ticket of 15,000 pieces (1.2 euros), are taken from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people.
"It's a job for shoes, not for people," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old Korean carrier who spent three decades in Kavah-Ijeen, since he left college.
He is able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he is confident that he will be able to work as much as he can, because he needs money for the education of his three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retirement, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sira stirs the throat and tears the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the sugars in the flat stems of the volcano, they are so vulnerable that no one complains of their serious illness... more serious, apparently than their normal problems with breathing, arthrosis, knee pain and swelling of the lungs that have been deformed under the heavy root.
By balancing the corrosion on the back, the unique can now only raise 50 kilograms in its 53th year.
Every day he and his companions carry 15 tons of wool from the volcano, which carry three cargoes to the warehouse in Tamansari, a distance of more than 18 miles [18 km] across the narrow grasslands.
"I'm not going to retirement, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainnik says, a wide open mouth that doesn't touch a few teeth.
Of his five children, aged 30, he also works as a nurse.
Time is running out, but poverty continues to be one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what human remains are done with Kavah-Igena.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy.
Singaporeans accuse careers, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriot, you're my wife's patriot, I'll fulfill our civil debt, and I'll create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of soft drinks, but despite this - or perhaps thanks to it - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
These phrases are part of a rap, which uses local reservations such as "Let's put Bao (Bulku) in a dog", to laugh at the level of birth in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that with the help of the advertising, they will be able to pay attention to this problem in an exciting way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to fulfill his "national debt."
It's just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the main problem in the country.
We are poor in the world for the reproducing of ourselves, so we felt that this is the subject that we should address.
We knew that the Government had been trying to do a lot, for example, to engage in ghosts with pheromones or to organize the evenings of quick knowledge.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they were not necessarily working.
So we wondered why we would not do the most creative thing we could do to solve this problem, that is, create a rep?
1,2 children
Whoever doesn't understand it so easily, it's the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 per year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The State package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, prolongs pregnancy and childbirth and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological country in Southeast Asia, also known as the conservativeism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
It was the last time it was under 2 which was known as the percentage of accommodation in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Policy Office on Married Couples and Familys of the National Public Administration, says that the reason for "best education" and "more broad range of career opportunities".
“This has enabled people to have a broader range of options regarding the goals and priorities of life, in addition to marriage and family creation,” she explains.
These social changes contribute to the increase in the number of pregnancies and the elimination of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decrease in the fertility rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, immigration policies aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to the resistance to population reduction call for compensation among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that promote easily hidden xenophobicism with regard to many new immigrants, especially those who criticize low-level pay and do not want to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party has had a bad outcome in elections since independence last year.
After the election, an attempt was made to address the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unforeseen Effects
While the decline in fertility has a significant impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical and immigration policies, Singapore has also begun to have some unexpected effects.
The government is making efforts not to build such a small apartment.
For example, this has begun to affect the mobility sector.
The urban development guide has gone through the control of the number of small rooms known as the "wallboard" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are well sold in 46 square meters.
However, it is believed that they can contribute to a poor life - style and lose the incentive of drivers who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, Director-General of the El Developers Domestic Company, says that their "bombs" are sold much faster than space samples.
They are more popular, in the sense that such rooms are sold for a few days, even a week, faster than the larger rooms.
As a result, our income is increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules give more clear guidelines for the devices that had previously been proposed if they wanted to offer too many small rooms in the project.
Too busy
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the Centre, they appear to have no special effect.
"People are very upset, they live on the street, as well as education, and that's why many people do it," said the young manager.
Others may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another 20-year-old man.
Men and women mention their career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons for their ability to raise children.
So, as the Government has not tried to encourage its citizens to have children, in the case of detoxification, the last word remains with Singaporeans.
Private in offline - private in online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a matter of private or personal life which has the right to protect from any interference.
What is a person under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in the social networks?
Does he understand the dangers posed when discussing situations outside the Internet?
elPeriodico interviewed five children from 10 to 15 years of age, part of the network users.
In four cases they associated a term with "something very mine" in a personal form and a "password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets I would not load in the mail," said 10-year-old Horhe, when trying to explain the importance of a person on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has written records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not all peace," he says.
At the FB I'm loading beautiful pictures or pictures from the game.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that wasn't mine, or someone who was taking me stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish a wide range of photos of people who have been charged with crimes or who have written disturbing or angry comments.
Horhe believes he knows the 35 friends he has in the FB and nine of his follovers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother in the course has a password for one of the accounts.
I took Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks - entertainment, I can talk to other relatives or my friends faster," he says.
Not to be overlooked, he replied that he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't think of anyone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This youth has open-ended accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and recently recognizes that 20 people on his list do not know.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him and asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they're going to give or demand me, I'll just get them out of my account record," he admits.
José became a follow-up to Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
Boys don't have any special experience that today is known as cybermoving.
One of my well-known friends was in a social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He didn't even know who it was," he concludes.
The victim, José said, didn't leave the record.
"Just included confidentiality."
It will then explain the consistency of the steps to be taken in a safe manner.
Unlike Horhe, this boy would load pictures of people who are familiar with unusual or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like it or if I wanted it.
"I guess I know it's cybermoving," he says.
Key issues
Marelos Porras, an English teacher and teacher in education and education, believes that to send children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has appeared as a means to search for information, but the rules of the game have changed through these sites,” she noted.
Phras points out that academic Mark Prenski, professor of pedagogical studies at the University of Jeel and the author of the work of the Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, has chosen these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital Aborigines are those who were born in the era of technology.
"Our digital immigrants who are going to learn them while we are still learning," she says.
It explains that it is difficult, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion that they can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken, when adults are not mature enough to do so."
"They should also be selective, while it is important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to a specialist, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality is for children and adults is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do this is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you be pleased if they posted a photo of you like what you've published about your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you sign a photo with dinner, do you ask others to notice them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they should be online as they do this offline.
She did the same.
“The Internet is a human being with respect, responsibility and other principles, as must be in the social networks,” she says.
Length
Estuardo Guardia, university teacher, primary education professor and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social networks policies carefully.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reasons for questioning children about the pre-opening of an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key issue is to remind children of the lesson: "Don't talk to strangers."
The UNASUR Summit is closed without the mention of the Lime Declaration
The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was completed today in Peru without the announcement of the Lime Declaration, previously announced by the theoretically signed family of mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to obtain access to a document signed at the VI regular meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but the sources from the Office and the President's Administration indicated on the main page that it would be delivered after closing but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some time.
On the subject of the text, they indicated that the content was presented by President Peru, Olianta Umala, during short press statements.
The access of journalists to information on the Summit was still limited.
During the day, only the video of the Presidential Assembly was transmitted, without a voice, to the press room, with a message of "closed meeting, closed voice".
Several information circulated to reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments attending the meeting but not Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused the discontent of hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who requested more information.
The administration of President Peru subsequently sent an e-mail to the IMI with the "final Declaration" of the summit, but it was about the Umala statement, not the official document which the summit had completed.
In October, Peru adopted the III Summit of South American and Arab States (ASPA) and at the same time, despite its persistent demand for press, the so-called Lime Declaration, which had previously been declared, was not distributed.
The ASPA official website can verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities were raised to provide transmission systems for all journalists, but to limit access to information.
The Summit also concluded with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt the Hague Court of Justice, which regulates the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinier, gathered at the regional meeting and ratified that the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began on Monday in Hague, would be heard by both parties in the context of the allegations that Lima had made against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement the decision to clarify the differences we are presenting in this international court," Umala said, along with her Chilean colleague.
“There has been, and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of differences, pacts and international tribunals”, he added, and welcomed the release of Umala's hand on the flag of those two countries.
The confirmation by both of the Presidents that they are under the International Court of Justice took place soon after Colombia rejected this week of the Divine Covenant, according to which it recognized the submission of the beliefs of this International Court after the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be wrong.
The summit was absent from the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirsner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 after its former President, Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The Acting President, Olianta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the fall of the time.
The head of the State read the outcome document in which it reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects were approved among South American countries, the estimated investment amounting to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he noted that the countries of UNASUR would take "the important steps towards South American citizenship, for which we would extend the agreements on the place of residence".
He reported that action was taken to improve “cooperation in combating civil uncertainty and organised transnational crime, to increase access to medicines, to low Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the collective and effective risks of natural disasters”.
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic union (Latin America) should not have a trimfactory basis but should serve to broaden our productive base and foresee a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We have decided to privileged a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the links between South America, particularly in the rural and border areas... by combining our countries and creating new economic schemes," the Peruvian President said in a statement.
Among those projects, he noted that five were related to Peru, and that there were limited percentages in his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two objectives for greater contact with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as a re-unition of South American nations” from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have a good relationship with its neighbours, was another topic highlighted at summits.
In this regard, President Juan Manuel Santos, President of Colombia, said that before attending a regional meeting, he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to negotiate in a respectful manner on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the International Court of Justice of Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday), perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortegay," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan pact that will require discussions with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell him that we are dealing with this as much as possible with civilization and respect," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are scheduled to join the new presidential office of this country, Enrique Pjeja Nito.
The Minister of Defence also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, aimed at strengthening the dialogue and unity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay formed UNASUR, although the last country's participation was suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional block.
" South America must learn in Europe about the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Raphael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of a common civilization is the goal of which "South America, in this case, should be taught in Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, declared on public television Peru that Europeans had “killed each other during the Second World War” and on other occasions, “but now they are practically one child”.
In this context, he protected the draft establishment of South American citizenship, which was approved by the States parties to UNASUR.
“There must be a free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactive sectors that want to bring us back in the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also been a party to the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAG) in order to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account those signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read lessons never take on any obligations, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"We cannot explain that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador's founder WikiLeaks Julian Assanzu.
Correa was convinced that he did not regret the decision because he did not give up his principles and respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that “there were certain suspicions that Assang would be expelled in a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
In addition, he criticized Swedish justice for requesting access to his territory to investigate the alleged sexual crime, while “only Swedish legislation considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that might be held by Ecuador's Embassy in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of damage to Assanga's physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since he arrived at our mission, but the messenger told me that he had a small legal problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
In fact, this is the risk of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to intrusion in small space without the possibility of air-conditioning.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa indicated that the issue of asylum granted to Assanzu from June to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing assurance of uncertainty that would allow him to go to Ecuador, was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that negotiations in London were seeking a solution to the challenge of the founding of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, as Assanza, Baltasar Garson, is conducting several processes in various European institutions,” he said.
He expressed the view that "if the United Kingdom provides security tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation, and in other cases as it has already done, requests Ms. Assanga to serve Ecuador in London or to ask for Skype, this problem will be eliminated tomorrow.
Correa used the case to prove herself a protector of freedom to print and stressed that it would not tolerate “direction, ignorance and lies that claim freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of freedom to print these are not disbanded politicians, but bad journalists who support food, cash and demand," he said.
In this regard, he remained pleased that neither these journalists, "neither the Banks nor the Burmese-Hegemists, are not in Ecuador," and added that, being re-elected, would "enhance the revolution for development in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's visa in NASA in at least prior to the following elections, arguing that the organization “should be firm and not tolerate opposition and support for transfers under a minority law”, because it actually “has destroyed the legality of the Paraguay democracy”.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President had considered his “highly justified” wish by his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries following the decision of the Hague International Court of Justice, which had been in favour of the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision is not implemented at this time.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a desire to be together.
They need to be prepared to overcome them and move on.
He also hoped for the good conclusion of the dispute on the maritime borders that would lead to the same Court of Peru and Chile, and said that "it was right for Latin America to appeal to international institutions if two countries were committed to making a decision as difficult as it was."
With regard to the opportunity to vote as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador to vote for a third term, he indicated that he considered this opportunity “with greater optimism and joy, although it was sometimes hard enough.”
Correa was convinced that if she missed the elections in February 2013, she would leave the public life.
Personally, I was never interested in power, but in situations such as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be addressed by political authorities.
"My political movement thought that I had guaranteed this possible victory, so it was worth acknowledging that responsibility," he said.
In the event of victory, this would be my last time in office as president, and then we would leave public life.
If I miss it, it's the same.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I was just talking to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he was going to a treatment that was already scheduled to be routine and that he was expected to leave the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean an increase in President Chavez's health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State took part today in Lima at the VI summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today - the result of post-diagnosis
The factory was 21 years old when it was announced that its AIDS analysis had a positive effect.
"I've been lied to," he recalls that difficult, despite all that doctor, a moment.
The young man stole it from his family.
He decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know more about it, and his efforts were justified - he already noticed his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio was one of the "old" HIV patients in the Hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he fell in 1994, with no obstacle.
It's been living with the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. It would have been hard to believe at the beginning of the 1990s - too little then there were treatment options, too little to know about the disease, too much about the disease.
Yes, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to go with him, "because he was late."
In other words, AIDS was a prison at the time.
Now you can survive this syndrome and do it without damaging the quality of life.
However, I don't know about my illness, so many people come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greater achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, said HCG head of HIV, Jaime Andrade Vilanoeva, stating that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Viljanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a prison, but the duration and quality of life depend on the severity of the immune system in patients at the start of diagnosis, with the best expected life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 is reported.
Simply speaking, the above implies that one who receives HIV-positive diagnosis at 25 years of age, according to these terms, “sustaining control will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people died in Halisko in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been recorded this year; however, it is claimed that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there summers so far?
- I personally feel that the problem is not available for treatment.
So I imagine that's what happens in our hospital.
As at least 12 years ago we had no medical shortage, the problem of patients coming too late because they don't know about their infected condition is that there are late stages of disease.
He added: "Ten of ten patients are coming when they already have some opportunistic infection; what must be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to conduct a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for the mass detection of all those who are requested to do so."
In its proposal, experts and officials of the State Council on the Prevention of AIDS in Halisko (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, the type of Fabrizio, who sought to verify in a private laboratory, were encouraged only by what his partner did and, despite his youth, had already been at the AIDS stage and even suffered by Sarko Kaposhi, a cancer that was one of the widespread complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're dying, and they don't want to know anything.
"I'd rather die than die, I'd better survive three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm good at asking, I'm practicing, I'm taking medication.
Today, his parents only know he's got cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but with a common responsibility, I worry about myself and another person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILLENIO JALISCO in order to move his statement to those who are now in the context of the World Day of the Fight against AIDS.
Let them see if there is a risk of injury, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive and better, and if they already have diagnosis, let them know that they can live as any other person is responsible.
This message summarizes the topic of combating AIDS in 2012.
Dockable containers
The great gap between health programmes and a simple citizen is attributed to Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalaire, who was involved in the HIV-related problem.
And that's the biggest prevention.
In areas related to this task, "in fact, there has been increased the distribution of condoms, one or two before we were given one or two, now they give us packages per cent, and this is very good, but it seems that there are those who have not yet had access to condoms," he said.
Adults are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
“Why are they for you?” That is a popular question, with jealousy and condemnation, by social workers, school consultants, pharmacists, and health workers who do not want to hear adults.
I propose to amend this ineffective distribution; to make reservations not only for trailers but also for hundreds of them in public toilets in places where young people are often visited.
It's not a promotion of depletion.
It is not about the payment of beer and the motorcycle, answered Governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked if it would be possible to pay the condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sex, it's best to make condoms available for those who already practice sexual activity," he noted.
Key data in Halisk
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State takes the fourth place in the national retina on the new and summary cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV.
92% of injuries are related to sex, 6% via blood, and 2% on perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as in one recorded case there are from 4 to 5 people who do not know about it.
Taking into account the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision annulling the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through the competitive production in Mexico, the scenario establishes an annual precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has problems with payment capacity.
Procedures to support the survival of a company permitted by Mexican law appear to be not valid in the country of land and star, in contrast to international agreements.
In the practical area, the decision of Judge Harlin Hail, on 15 June, in the northern part of Texas, left the vulnerable Mexican companies before anyone could arrest their property on the part of Rio Grande.
However, the decision opens the door to the leading producer of glass in Mexico for treatment in the United States Supreme Court, resulting in three contradictions.
As an introduction, while the judge notes that creditors should be regulated by the United States Banking Code, the appeal court of the fifth district in New Orleans states that the main proceedings relate to the competitive production in Mexico.
The first paragraph means the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of the inability of transnational firms to pay.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Harmonization of International Trade Law was established, as an arbitrator of the American Institute of Law.
Second, the claim states that without an interlocutory vote recognized in the critical mass of the competitive debt production held before the parent company of the Vitro branch, the majority would not have been reached to be approved for restructuring.
However, this opportunity is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
Among the examples of Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, the interfering debt guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that, given the vote of the branches, or of other creditors of Vitro who fought against him in the courts of the United States, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, the majority would not.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are dropped by the Appeals Tribunal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of a complex situation that has been facing since 2008, in the face of a serious economic crisis that has taken place in the United States.
As soon as the Gonsales Sada's family company filed an appeal in the appeal court itself to bring the vote to its plenary, there were five judges, since only three were voting.
In the event of failure, a request for confirmation will be made, which will require a review of the process by the Supreme Court of the United States of America in the case of the Supreme Court.
Most importantly, the court rejected a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae (the second court), which described the process followed by Vitro under the Competitions Act, signaling that it was exempt from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries in order to link it with article 15 of the United States Banking Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, the rules established for cases of intergovernmental incompatibility that guarantee equal rights to officials and creditors.
Two-boats: they're in Vitro and they're in the country.
General balance
In the light of the complaints filed for several months by Mexican de Aviación, against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarraga Andrade, who is accused of moustache management, has already found the pilots' association of pilots in the aircraft.
The Institute, led by Carlos Dias Chavez Morino, has only provided criminal proceedings against the National Banks Commission and valuable books charged with the prohibition of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the Attorney-General of the Republic on the operations carried out by an undertaking to withdraw from the Trust Fund F/589 Bank of IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
Resources would be allocated to the purchase of shares of the Professional Board of Directors.
As you know, Askarrag Andrad is the main shareholders of the Posadas Valley network.
Around Dragon Mart
At the forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environments, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the establishment of a broad front against the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country of the product of the isolated country, with 150 companies living near the area.
In the past, Canacintra has been able to unite the Governors of the South-East Zone to counter the monumental forces that have taken over parts of the protected territories and pose serious threats to the industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the request by the Government of the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Corruption, known as the obligation on the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, that case had already been in the archives.
As you know, the action has been carried out, despite the fact that the Senate has disqualified the opportunity to consider it as a violation of freedom of expression in the social networks.

Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
For more than 60 years, he had been involved in this sport and, thanks to him, had traveled all over the world.
A few in Puerto Rico remember so many basketball stories like Hector Hetin Reyes.
As long as the bleeding into the brain led him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was loaded into sport for more than 60 years, as a small category game, a high basketball game, a BSN leader and leader with Kovboja Baamona and the president of the basketball Federation.
"I have played a lot of roles in the basketball for my life, including several times as I was president of BSN, the Director-General of the National Team and the President of the Federation in the 1990s," recall Reyes during his visit to Primera Hora to his home in Bajamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating by making that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all the damaged photographs and monuments gathered along his long way, testify to this.
Bajamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, it preserves those who remember its way through Kovboev, from the mid-50s as a game until 1982, when it was held for 15 years as a partner or contract agent.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most, because it was possible to be part of eight Kovboev champions since 1967, as an agent, associate or manager.
It was many years of joy, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
Then I applied for one in 1981, in the year of Jerome Minsi's BSN debt.
Since then, it has continued to lead as Kuko Ortis, who was the great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember that Jean Bartov, who was here at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong game for you, a 6'7" growth."
"Do you want?"
And that was the start of Minsi, one of the best games in Puerto Rico.
Bartów then recommended the shooter Raymond Gaussa, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsi had brought the Baamon Championships, Gauss would have helped us get another one.
Kovboev and I enjoyed the campaign with Gaussian, but I am already in the distance because by 1988, I had become the head of the Federation.
At the same time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the National Assembly.
I remember the first time we won in the United States during the Olympic Qualification Tour in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we got the fourth place, and it should be a bronze, if not the Canadian judge who stopped us from playing the final game, said Reyes.
That's the '90 World Championship team, that's the best collection you've ever seen?
She was among the best, as well as what she won at the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite thing was that from the Spanish games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke up the United States, which was quite like the one that won our bronze at the world's championship.
Not only were Minsi, Gaussa, Ramona Rivasa, Fico Lopes and 'Piculina' (Ortisa), but also young (Havier) Colon and James Carter, Brother Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario 'Kichote' Morales, who were unable to participate in the 90s because of the injuries of the knee.
The command, which may not have been the best in the field of personal composition, but which brought us the gold medal and great joy, was a 1995 Olympic Qualification tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing games like 'Kantito' Nyves, Pablo Alice and young Roland Horruitner instead of games that were temporarily removed from the Pan American champion Mar del Plat, we won gold despite all the predictions.
Who was the best game in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
Its indicators on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level just like Piculin did.
And that's not his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a very difficult question.
We had a very good youth, including Julia Toro, Flora Melindas, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
As a young man, I like the work of Leo Ariel.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious period of the national assembly between 1988 and 1995, and that at the beginning of the 1990s in the BSN there were up to 17 teams in the season.
What are you still doing?
There were things I wanted to achieve, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, to play only in their area and against command from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now children travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of compulsory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and look at basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife's society, Jacob, who has always been with me.
Killer actor Larry Hegman
Larry Haggman, born 21 September 1931 in Fort Urte, Texas, became well-known as John Ross Yuinga, better known as J.R., in Dallas, in which he charged a businessman with no principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Higman, whose role of oil magnetist Jay Ar Yuing in Dallas' TV series became a sign of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday because of the difficulties caused by cancer, according to the family statement provided by The Associated Press by Warner Bros., Dallas.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing a character role, which he loved most," his family said.
The Larry family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on a march on the day of thanking him.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the sicvele, was in close contact with Hegman when he died in Dallas' hospital, her representative, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought happiness to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, happy, lovely and talented, and I'm going to be very proud of him.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," confirmed Grey in a statement.
He was diagnosed with cancer in 1992, and he admitted that he had been smoking for many years.
In 1995, he was found guilty of stealing and was transferred to a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hegman gained knowledge on television thanks to the role of a regular type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", transmitted by the NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, whose life changed when he met a attractive girl who played Barbara Iden and began to live with her under one cross.
He was also the chief staff of two comedians who appeared often in the ephere, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included roles, well-known criticisms, in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But his masterful interpretation of J.R. brought Himman to the top of glory.
The Dramatic Series of the CBS canal on the Yuangov clan and other personnel in its surroundings was held in Effer from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan “Who shot in J.R.?”, designed to create a forest around the episode, full of emotions in which Hegman's personnel are almost not killed, has generated international discussions and millions of dollars that were at risk in the bookmaker offices.
It also helped to attract a serial recording audience in that port.
When an answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million televised it and translated Dallas into the second of the historical screenings of the entertainment programme, following the completion of the MASH in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was a J.R., Kristin (formerly Mary Crosby), who shot at him.
J.R. confused her and then threatened to accuse her of being a prostitute if she did not get out of town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hygmen has served as a non-smoker of charismatic fraud: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful man who wanted his wife, Sie Ellen (Linda Grey), to take care of the treatment.
"I know it's supposed to be on the J.R." He said in 1988.
It must be said, "The honest citizen J.R. Yuing is here."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also a hero of the original series, mentioned on Friday Hygmena as someone "great as both on and outside the screen."
He does not forget, and he does not change, for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us, who has the pleasure of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown several months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The fifth episode of the second season was already completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not made statements about what will happen with the serial after Hegemen's funeral.
Fort-Uerta, Texas, was the son of the actress and poet Mary Martin, who had been featured in classical productions such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 when he married a lawyer named Ben Hegman.
He was happy at New York's theatre scenes in the early 1950s and then served in the UK from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist named May Axelson and married him.
There were two children, Preston and Haydi, and they lived in the California city of Malibu, where there were many nominees.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tal (and absolutely True) Tales about my Life".
"I didn't include anything there that would have been able to cause or affect anyone in any way," he said, at the time.
After transplantation, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to the operation, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some relief, such as, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little awkward for a while, but you'll be fine."
He also spoke actively against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course to study the end of the world begins.
Every week, students study apocalyptic events such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Sharme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an inexhaustible impression: the end of the "long return" calendar of May 21, December 21, for which many people had been arrested as evidence that the end of the world was burning.
But Sharme had no idea what it was expected in the next few months: the disaster hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the “long-term Armageddon”, and the growing conflict that hit Israel, a place where Christian theories at the end of time believe that the Apocalypse is starting.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharme to the students at Rutgers-Kamden University (New Jersey) this week.
To analyze what is happening in the world at this time, as if we had all 30 days, was really a good time.
And remember, it's good for those who have the apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the Temppl University of Applied Professor Barry Walker reads the course "The media of mass information, culture and the end of the world".
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We are analyzing why these ideas are being spread over time," he said, and the ways in which hypothetical scenarios call for certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can spread.
In this month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I've tried to tell the students what might probably be true and impossible," Wacker said.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solaris, an associate professor of art and anthropology, joined to read a course called the end of the world.
"We don't add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, if the end of the world doesn't come," Restall said.
Despite the “unforeseen destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and conduct an examination.
In the Pen State, an examination will be carried out in the Apocalypse Canal, which does not leave students a choice, except to work "to the very night in which the end of the world is likely to come," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The city ended in two hours," Restall said about his course for students with a high-end ball that 35 students were enrolled.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the start of the seminar from people who asked if there was any more places.
The students, in turn, believe that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, 23-year-old student of the Huddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Kamden.
And the apocalyptic image, whether worldly or religious, is just a matter of rest or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychologist and nurse, said he watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach it," he said.
I like him.
But not one of the missing students - not talking about the professor anymore - said he didn't believe in the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project affected the prophecy of May, and in some way we discriminated against it," said Julie Zegelen, a 21-year-old student at the University of Tempel in West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
He noted, however, that there was an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which took place for a few centuries, where people responded to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has raised these speculations.
"People in other places don't think about it," he said.
Especially in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerti, professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew any course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, pointing to the order of the above instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
He pointed out that for a long time, there was much talk about the last days of the court, and said that if nothing would happen on 21 December, “people would immediately begin to think about the next day” or to imagine that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period during which the world would end.
Students and teachers are safe from this date.
Some said they're going to go to "the end of the world" tonight.
"Maybe I call a friend to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old college student.
