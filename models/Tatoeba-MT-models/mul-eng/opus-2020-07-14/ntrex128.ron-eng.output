Members of the Gallerian National Union are concerned about the fact that they might be perceived as "marionites"
More members of the National Assembly of the Galleries are detained because they have proposed to change their title, i.e. to call them MWP (members of the Gallerian Parliament).
This problem was caused by the plans to change the name of the meeting of the Parliament of the country of Galilee.
Members of the National Union of Galleries present on the political scene are afraid that this would lead to rediculating.
A member of the Laburist Party of the National Union of Gallera is concerned about the fact that "he's with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Galilee: "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "female matter".
A member of the Gallerian Party of the National Union of the Gallera stated that the group “is not pleased” and suggested alternatively.
A member of the Conservative Party said that the group had an "open" attitude towards the change in its name, but that it also observed that "MWP" was similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in the country of Galilee as "u" in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Association Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation for introducing the name change, stated: "The final decision on how the members are named will certainly depend on even their members."
The Law of 2017 on the Government of the Sea of Galilee offered the Union the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that many of these wish to use the "Parliament of the country of Galilee".
With regard to the title of the members of the National Union of Galilee, the Commission preferred "Members of the Parliament of the Sea of Galilee" or "WMP", but the option "MWP" received the most votes during the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the Gallerian National Assembly suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach a consensus might give Elin Jones, the president of the Steering Committee, who is expected to send the bill on changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way of functioning of the meeting, including the rules on decalculation of the members and structure of the Committee's system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is repealed.
Macedonians voted in favour of the referendum on the change in the country's name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their views on the change in their country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote was organized to resolve an old debate with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Government of Athens has for a long time insisted that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a claim on his territory and has repeatedly opposed the accession of Macedonia to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition from the populace on the change of name, said he will not take this vote into account.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is only a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bishops' clubs have stopped fighting as a result of the problems facing the bishops in Harlem
"From historical point of view, the veterans of the place I spoke to told me that before, you found a bar and a church on every street corner," Adams said.
"Now, there are no bars and no churches."
He also said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"The bars no longer play the day's room for the entire library, where people usually grow up."
And as for churches, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will cost faster than expected leaders and that, “more or later, the decline will be the same.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with crowded condoms of people who would not support the remains of the archives.
"The vast majority of people who will buy condoms in these buildings will be white-colored," he said, "this will therefore speed up closing the churches, as it is less likely that many of the people who move into these condoms will become members of the churches in question."
Both churches were built by white-colored congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the Metropolitan St. Martin Community in 1870, after a decade.
The original methodological congregation, formed by white persons, moved from the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-American people who engage in religious activities nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's church was taken by an African-American congregation, led by Governor John Howard Johnson, who inspired trades from 125th Street, a main road for the purchases of Harlem, which opposed the engagement or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but Johnson’s grandparents planned to rebuild and included the carillion in it.
Reverence David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father and successor at St. Martin’s church, called the "clums of poor people".
The expert who worked on the career in July described it as "a cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument of non-replacement".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, has already declared that it was the first career in the world active by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who spent 18 years in a larger career at the Riverside church.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced with St. Martin.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought from church diaconies, others from episcopal diocese.
The Sacristia, the ruling entity of the parish, formed from the diocese, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the Sacrist, even if it was not involved in the occupation of architects and contractors sent by diocese.
Some of the enoriaists complained of lack of transparency that proved diocosis.
A rabbit injured a 13-year-old child trying to catch men in California
According to the authorities, Saturday, a rabbit attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while trying to catch men in California on the day of the opening of the human season.
The attack took place about 7:00 a.m., near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel declared for the KSWB-TV post in San Diego that he spent about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and then moved in with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel further stated that at first he thought the boy was glad he had caught a man, but then he realized that the arrow "Must me!
He touched me!"
The whole keyboard was over, Hammel said he noticed when he arrived at the boy.
"I broke down to all those who were in the water, and said to them, 'It is a dog in the water.' " Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still critical.
You don't know the species of the lion responsible for the attack.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a rabbit has been observed in the area for a few weeks, but it has been concluded that it is not a species of rabbit that poses a threat.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper part of the throne.
The authorities restricted access to the Ponto beach from Casablad to Swami from Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons .
Giles has already mentioned that there are more than 135 species of rabbits in the region, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retaliary Saninsbury plans to consolidate its position on the market for fruit and vegetables from the British Sea
Sainsbury buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, making available radio products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a boosting position on the market for fruiting products in the UK, with a value of 2.8 billion sterline lires, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not on a scale, the larger roots with fruit products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into more stores in the next year, if there is evidence of success.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context of which supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for television, microwaves and household products.
The representatives of the Sainsbury retaliator stated that the number of products to be offered will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaxes its range of machinery products, Boutique, which means that most of the products are intended for young people, a request for what is most met among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French dealer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury launch magazines, for testing, first being the open week in Croydon, south of London, and second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online purchases and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food each day from the nearest food store mean that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sansbury dealer, said that the airports will show more than universal stores, because the supermarkets are trying to deal with the great deal of retailing, Aldi and Lidl, which offers more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included both products from outside Argos in hundreds of stores, as well as Habits, since it purchased both launchs in two years, which means it recorded increases in food sales, as well as increase in profit.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to re-compensate the compartments of pharmaceutical products and fraud has failed.
Sainsbury tried to fuse with Boots at the beginning of 2000, but negotiations began after a divergence on how to share the Boots magazine's revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold the pharmaceutical business that included 281 stores, the company Celesio, which holds Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million sterline lires, after three years.
This means Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury brands to care for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director of the Sansbury Retaliary, said: "I have transformed the aspect of our radios with heating products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized instruction of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations transform us into an extraordinary place to buy fruit products, revolutionising the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones's angry after Holly Willoughby retired from a 11 million-free deal.
Dragons' Den, Peter Jones, is angry after the TV show Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a contract worth 11 million stereo-litres with his life-style company, to focus on its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to engage in their project on Truly brand, which includes accessors and household use objects.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, held by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, 37-year-old "This Morning" issue, announced on Instagram that it will be withdrawn.
Holly Willoughby generated Peter Jones' anger, the protagonist of the “Dragons” Den issue, leaving the last moment of their business offering lifestyle services to concentrate on its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most popular people on television recognized Tuesday, during a meeting at the headquarters of his empire of business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that their new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million stereos, no longer allow them to devote their brands, Truly, which includes accessors and household items.
The company was compared to Goop's brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and almost doubled Willoughby's worth, with an estimated 11 million sterline lires.
After Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that he would give up his contract for Truly, Jones left the British Sea to flee one of his holiday houses.
One source stated: “Truly was one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be her future in the long term, for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw has been sought out all over the world.
No one came to believe what happened yesterday, it was less until the launch.
There is a full deposit with products at Marlow's seat that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" emissions from the best sold from the UK could lead to the loss of millions, as a result of investments in products such as paints and lighting, clothing objects and household items, as well as the possible additional delay of launch.
It can also represent the end of a long - distance friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby laid the foundations of Truly's brand together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their vacation together, and Jones has 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the Ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the boss of the I'm A Celebrity issue from the ITV.
A close source of Jones stated last night: “We don’t want to talk about his business. ”
I was very hard, and then I said, "I love you."
He made jokes in the light of the criticisms he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider "no one of the presidents" and that he has such a positive attitude about the Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a step back?
Trump said by imitating a voice from the "representative of news".
"I haven't taken a step back."
He stated that Kim is interested in having another meeting after the first Singapore meeting in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
For the better three months since the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the whole world at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not observe a "responsive answer" from the United States on the previous nightmares of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to impose pressure in this regard.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"It's all going well with North Korea," he said.
"We must go to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He added that his efforts to improve Kim's relationship had positive results: stopping rocket tests, supporting the release of hostages and returning to the US military.
She also showed her unusual way to talk about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to treat you as a president, but if I did, instead of 10,000 people outside, who are trying to get into this incapacitated arena, it would be about 200 people," said Trump, showing to the crowd that is in front of him.
A tsunami and a tsunami in Indonesia destroyed an island causing hundreds of deaths.
Following the summit in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their assistance is not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok has been displaced, there has been no national disaster, a condition necessary for international aid action.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about the fact that international assistance is not sought, so it is a difficult situation," said Sumbung.
Although the foundation “Save the Children” is trying to form a team to travel to Paul, it is not yet known if foreign personnel are allowed to access the site.
Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said that the Indonesian authorities evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
In view of Indonesia's constant costs, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be sufficiently prepared for the anger of nature.
Although they were built for tsunamis in Aceh, they are not met very often on other coasts.
It seems that the lack of a warning siren in the case of tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued in this sense, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters are more and more complex.
A hospital that stopped in Lombok to deal with the victims of torture is directed to Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity has occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that the improvement of the emergency infrastructure in Indonesia be the central point of his electoral campaign and allocate money to roads and railways.
But the lack of funds affected Joko's administration, which will take part next year in a new electoral campaign.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from the sections of Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes because gangs of Christians and Muslims were trapped on the streets, using cats, bows and arrows, as well as other handguns.

Cromwell's status in Parliament becomes the most recent memorable memory affected by the changes concerning "recording history"
It would represent a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban style of such British cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by its fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's company described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a crazy" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: “It was inevitable in the debate on the departure of states like Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace to become a prisoner.
The iconic of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for his uncle Thomas's actions in the past century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and a part of the history of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith stated for The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defence of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Regardless of whether it is about a precise representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But certainly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure, which represents a part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector deserve, too, celebrated and remembered."
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only after the name of the family "Yuan", was found dead after he was cut off from the art and was covered with blood, near a pig farm located on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou, according to the daily newspaper of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that she came with her brother from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 dogs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and found out that the door of a nearby cottage was open.
This said that a pig of large size with blood on its skin is found in the quota.
The legislators confirmed that an approximately 300 kg pig caused the death of the farmer, according to the report.
"My brother's daughters were full of blood and finished," said the widow whose family name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed their pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The soul that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor did his faith.
A market representative said for Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police sent evidence from the crime scene.
Yuan's family and the authorities seem to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although it's rare, there have been reported cases of pigs that attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
In the past 10 years, because of a 300 kg pig, a man in Galler's country was blocked in his tractor until his wife came to fear and to chase the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba declared to the CBC News that dogs are not normally aggressive, and that the taste of blood may express such reactions."
“Just play.
They like to move, they're very brave... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to bring them respect," he said.
The Rosa Urgan, who lost her intensity, will cause torrential rains in the south-west of the United States
As foretold, Rosa’s hurricane is losing its intensity as it moves to the more recent waters north of Mexico’s coast.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause floods in northern Mexico and southern the United States in the coming days.
Rosa records sales conditions with a speed of 85 km/h, being a category 1, Sunday, from 5:00 a.m. and was located about 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive in the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it began to form a depressive zone over the Pacific Ocean and move east, to the west coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the Baja California Peninsula, months, in the form of tropical storm, it will begin to push the intense tropical humidity from the north to the south-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa's gonna bring the precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical moisture that will interact with the depressive zone will generate abundant rain in the south-west in the following days.
Local precipitations between 3 and 10 cm will cause rapid flooding, floods of waste and, possibly, landslides in desert.
The intense tropical humidity will cause cuts of precipitation up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is expected between 5 and 10 cm south-west, especially in most Arizona.
It is possible to have rapid flooding due to rapid deterioration conditions as a result of the nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert below in view of the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rain could cause the canyons to be transformed into violent rivers, and the storms will bring local sales in raffles and prawns.
The nearby depressive zone will bring torrential rains to the southern coast of California.
It is possible to precipitate about 2 cm, which could determine lower fluids of lumnecoasal and ducts.
These will be the first precipitation in the region, in the winter season.
Tropical floods will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and in the first part of the month, before the rains spread more months in the evening and in the morning.
The intense precipitations will be spread in the so-called "father of harvests" tomorrow and will persist until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense change of temperature in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropicals remain quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature on short distances.
Sunday, there are dramatic differences of temperature at the U.S. central area.
There is a temperature difference of about 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the long summer heat will try to form and expand again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern U.S. area will be confronted with a hot beginning of October, with temperatures up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from south to certain parts of the north-east.
Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, with approximately 4 degrees over the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows large temperatures over the middle of the U.S. summer until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's audience
More than 20 million people have followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV posts interrupting the normal Friday program for an hour ago: an agreement concluded between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to conduct an investigation of charges within a week.
Ford said in front of the trial judge that it's 100% sure that Kavanaugh touched her while she was in high school and that she tried to get her out of a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in the context of an intense march, said it's 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have been followed by the hearing tomorrow.
The company counted the average surveillance on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually has problems in concording the people he sees from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to the one for a football game in play-off or the Academia Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's number, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC found on the second floor with a number of 3.26 million TV viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, 2.94 million NCBs, 2.89 million MSNBCs and 2,52 million CNNs.
Interest remained at a high level after hearing.
Flake was in the center of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement to vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS Chambers tomorrow morning as protestors shouted at him and he tried to move into an elevator at a sitting of the Judicial Committee.
He's been looking down for a few minutes while people were looking for him, and everything was delivered directly to CNN.
"I'm right here, in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
It was said to them: "O power, while such women are not able to do it."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, he'd have more to say at the Commission's seat.
Televisions were later broadcast directly as part of the Judicial Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he'd only do this if the FBI agreed to analyze the charges against the nominalism next week, which is called for minority democracies.
Flake was convinced most of the conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and many senators after that.
Flake's election was an important one, making it clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accused the "political games" of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of the British Mary and undermining national interests during an interview for Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister Maria Brittany, participated in the Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the photographer on his first page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on its plans for Brexit, as well as the Chequers plan, saying that the proposal to collect the prices of the UK and the European Union was "recitally complete".
The shooting of Wade Sims: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected he shot the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the case of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, 20 years old.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and closed, accused of murder of grade 2, according to the baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published the film of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his eye during the raid.
The police recovered their eyes from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, according to WAFB, CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say it recognized the fact that he shot Wade dead.
His prison was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Legal Medicine Bureau Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that death was caused by a head shot through the neck.
The Department agrees with the police force of Louisiana, the state-owned crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area, for the aid offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "diligentity and the quest for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker with a height of 1.98 m grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, it marked 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoverys.
Friday morning, LSU team coach Will Wade said that the team is "damaged" and "searched" by Wayde's death.
"This thing worries me all the time," said Wade.
A volcano threw a doll hole over Mexico City
Cenuşa from the Popocatepet volcano has arrived in the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the citizens of Mexico on Saturday to keep the distance from the volcano after its activity in crater and 183 gas emissions were recorded and known over 24 hours.

Interpolation between Catalan police and separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after the pro-independence protestors broke up with the Jandarmies, in the first anniversary of the vote for the Catalan secession, with thousands of dissident demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatives held away from the yards have bombed it with the oyster and the pothole, creating dark clouds of dust on the beaches which were usually flooded by tourists.
The attack was intensified later, and the police were using their batons to control the situation.
For a few hours, the pro-independence groups scand "We don't look, we don't apologize," while the Union's protesters streamed "Treaty Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to local press.
The tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent for a year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but by Catalan separatists.
The voters have chosen, in a coherent majority, to become independent, although participation in the vote has been reduced, and those against the sexes have voted in most of them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at the voting centres in the region, with violent harassment.
The Pro-Independence Groups have campaigned over the night of the evening to prevent demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer has any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“ Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I've seen my parents cry out with joy that I can vote, but now we don't have what to do," he said.
Despite the fact that a vital victory was achieved in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independent parties tried to maintain progress this year, many of the most well-known leaders found themselves in exile, either in detention, awaiting trial for the role of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the politicians of both sides had fed the conflict.
"The situation becomes more tense," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who have been imprisoned since the end of last year, announced that he will apply for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate at the European elections, it is the best way to denounce regret in democratic values and the repression I have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga's victory helped the Livingston team win 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston has guaranteed victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unreplied, Steven Gerrard arriving at the second launch in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The defeat of Dolly Menga proved to be a difference while Gary Holt's team played the same level with Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's team remains without a victory in the Premier League in this season and confronts the Hearts leaders, being behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers finds Quick Vienna in Europe League game.
In the meantime, Livingston continues to remain neutral in the division until six matches, Holt's main coach still feels the taste of burning because he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses his chance against the red visitors
Holt's team should have preceded much before he signed up, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to turn around and try to jump over the gate, then Alan Lithgow managed to jump wide after he entered by abstinence to intercept the messenger's message with Craig Halkett's head.
The Gazdeles were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that visitors could make problems with free hunting.
And that was the way the crucial gorilla came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston succeeded in opening up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson working to pass Menga, who visited and marked out of his center.
At that time, Rangers dominated his possession, but he faced the inevitable defense of the master, and the porter Liam Kelly was no longer in great trouble in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second rehearsal, although Alfredo Morelos strengthened a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman did not succeed against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgow gave a great victory from another player of the Livingston team.
The steps in the diagonal have continued to come to which the Livingston team, but not successful, and the two requests for sentences - after Halket burned Glenn Middleton and after a dog - were not accepted.
"Fenominal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotch on Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a final result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed the expectations of a rising trajectory.
Their game style and team has not changed since the return to top, but the values must be given to Holt for the way he trained the team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the party.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they had good performance since they were led by Gerrard, they didn't get to the same standards.
The gorillas were unsuccessful, they managed to catch the gate of the free opponents once, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, which is located in the middle of the class.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
It was all Saturday (September 29th), when the Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin to pick up the breakfast.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany to remedy the relations between NATO alliances.
They are ungrateful for problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city boasts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but enough supporters were gathered near to see the president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, the majority of the Kurds, heard the voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him with the arms open in the country.
Protests in the opponent reflect the division of a visitor considered to be a hero of some of the Turks of Germany and of others.

Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City is in danger of being flooded because of Rosa's hurricane (sectous zones can enjoy the benefits as a result of this)
It is rare to have a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is pretty likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, because the remaining energy resources of the Rosa hurricane will be used in the south-west desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of rapid flooding for the months and March in the Venetian region of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second day of the month, she will cause precipitation.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix announced in a message on Twitter that only “ten tropical cycles have maintained a hurricane or tropical depression on a distance of approximately 320 km from Phoenix in 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action on a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Uragane predict the precipitation ranges between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim from Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including the centre of the Stáncoși and Marele Bazin mountains, quantities ranged between 3 and 5 cm, with possible total quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in some areas, torrential rain will be beneficial, as the south-west is facing drought problems.
According to the United States Secet Monitor, less than 40% of Arizona is faced with the least severe sect, respectively the second largest category", information provided on weather.com.
First, Rosa's hurricane will lead to landslides in the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still has uragan power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, with 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet again in the Pacific and, as a result, it will decline.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce earthquakes in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or night of the month.
The torrential floods in Mexico could be significant, presenting a risk of high flooding.
"We are waiting for torrential rains ranged between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to the north-west of Sonori, and can reach 25 cm," according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before arriving at the border with Arizona in the morning of March, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching south Utah in the night of March.
"The main danger represented by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain from Baja California, north-west Sonoria and south-west United States desert," said a representative of the National Centre for Urigane.
It is expected that these plants will produce severe floods that will endanger people's lives, and will bring floods of waste, as well as earthquakes in mountain areas.

Trump stated that Kavanaugh faced with the "much and hand" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the gentle and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, Virginia, West.
Trump further stated that Kavanaugh faced the "much and hand" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
Joi, Kavanaugh gave a witness to the Congress, denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she had been sexually abused for ten years when they were teenagers.
Ford also made a statement in the sitting on her statement.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage that day."
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best lies in this generation's legal domain," he said many supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of the Republican presence in the interim elections.
"We are in five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
I can't, but, somehow, I can't," he said.
"For this reason, I express above all my positive opinion on candidates whom I consider to be outstanding."
Trump claimed that democracy is in a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination will take place the following Friday, a GOP leader's assistant for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, the number growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a powerful tsunami and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities declared Saturday.
Hundreds of people went to a beach festival in Palu City, when values with a height of six meters hit the beach at the amurg, people were taken from water and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree cutter.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not start immediately, becoming such victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the BNPB spokesman for a disaster relief agency, said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami brought with it cars, shoes, houses, hunting everything out," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled along with a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the country.
This added that some people were needed to jump into battle to escape tsunamis and survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency present more destroyed buildings and stores, damaged and damaged doors, as well as a water-contained mosque.
Saturday, the Replica continued to excavate the city found on the coast.
A series of torture was felt in a area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) of Indonesia stated that the energy generated by the strong winter rate was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb from World War II.
The geographical structure of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow golf course, probably intensified the expansion of the tsunami, added its representative.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels have collapsed.
The victims' troops were found caught under the walls of the damaged buildings, he said, in addition to 540 injured persons and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho said that the victims and payouts could be larger than 300 km north of Palu, a area called Dongäa, which is closer to the epicenter of the coast.
The communications were "completely disturbed, with no information" from Dongja, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but you may be ruined.”
Saturday, the agency was criticized for not informing the fact that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities declared the values reached at the time of the warning.
In the posts of socializing networks, a man found at the top of a building can be heard crying suddenly that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent road.
Within a few minutes, a water wall falls out of the country, taking these buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the material immediately.
The tsunami and tsunami caused a major interruption in electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the efforts of the authorities to save.
The army began sending warplanes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities declared, but evacuated persons still need food and other basic things.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the refugee centres in Palu for Sundays.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the staff Word Vision from Dongâna arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are cast into improvised shelters at the office court, they passed on devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: "They told me they saw many destroyed houses."
The situation is very serious.
Even if aid groups have begun to continue aid action in the event of disaster, some people have complained that professional foreign workers have been prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's regulations, financial resources, the delivery of materials and personnel can be achieved only if a national disaster zone is declared.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has yet been announced."
After two nights from the summer and winter tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing hope that the loved ones will be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was kicked out of a channel.
Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who was under two days' ruin, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the national parapants team, trained for Asian Games, which ended in early this month in Indonesia, two of the missing parapants pilots.
Other people at Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandiya, were her students.
"In view of the experience in parallel activities, I have my own emotional experience," she said.
Gendon reported how, in a few hours from the broadcast of the news about the Hotel Roa Roa Roa in the community of sports practitioners with parachutes, he sent desperate messages to whatsApp competitors from Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in the right of his messages, there was only one gray bib, and not two white bibs.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.

The Kanye West rapper changed his scene name to "Yes".
This made a Saturday announcement about the change on Twitter: "The official person known as Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, says "Yes" for some time and uses this title as title of the album's favorite album, launched in June.
This change comes before its appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where it is expected to launch a new album, Yandhi.
This comes to the issue instead of the song by Ariana Grande, who cancelled “for emotional reasons”, said the emissions producer.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of the current scene name, West stated earlier that this word also has a religious meaning for him.
“ I believe that “yes” is the most frequently spoken word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you”, said West at the beginning of this year, during the discussion on the title of the album with the Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, is the word about us.
Everything started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and got to "Ye", this is a reflection of our good, rare, unclear and whole things.
The album is more reflective about what we are as people."
He's one of the many rappers who chose to change the name of the scene.
Sean Combs had an unnamed scene name, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced the preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
And a former West's associate, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes in short, others without, as well as in big letters.
The President of Mexico promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, once he approached the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against the students.
Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelco Plaza that "he will never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The troops turned to a passive market demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the students' left movements broke out in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by offering monthly grants to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double the funding for IA
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its cost for research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after more U.S. government members made announcements about IA, even if in the US there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China has presented the last year's plan: it proposes to be the first place on IA innovation until 2030.
"Budget for IA research would be a good start, since all the other countries are much more behind the U.S. and that we are looking for the next discovery on IA," said Lee.
The duplication of funds could double the chances that the next major implementation in the IA area would be carried out in the US, declared Lee to the CBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "IA Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won the US player Othello, which was the best in the area at the time, and later was executive director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated the US government's previous competitions in technology, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency's advanced defence research projects, and asked when it will be next, to help identify the next survivors.
Researchers in the United States must often work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"China doesn't put drinks in the hands of academic leaders, but the corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired notable graduates from universities to work at IA in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to intensify IA's efforts.
"I think it should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued a Development Plan for the New Artificial Intelligence Generations in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to persons from academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations providing money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, with a view to involving the partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment of $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
Similarly, the NSF is currently investing more than $100 million annually in the research of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, no changes have been made to the laws of the United States aimed at creating a Commission for National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote at the referendum if they want to change the country's name
Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in favour of a referendum if they want the name of the country to be changed into the ‘North Republic of Macedonia’, a change that would resolve an old debate with Greece, which would oppose its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which contains a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country is a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June with regard to the new name proposed, but opposition nationalists support that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that a polling campaign was doubtful as to the vote, as it is possible not to reach a minimum of 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be validated.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree with accession to the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future country, so that young people in Macedonia will live free under the shadow of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska said, 79 years old in Skopje.
Although it is not mandatory from a legal point of view, many Members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name to be changed, there is a two-thirds round in Parliament.
The electoral commission of the state stated that no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the voting rights persons were present at the vote.
"I have come to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a voter from Skopje, the capital of the country.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, as well as their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change in the name of Macedonia, which will allow him to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small-scale scene and laid the foundations for the high-ranking courts of the referendum.
"We have NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the upper front, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want the name of Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO's accession will bring investments as necessary in Macedonia, which has a rate of more than 20% shock.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour of change of name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after he expressed his vote.
This said that a result in favour of the change of name would be “confirming our future”.
According to a poll published last month by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another Sunday, made by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of the change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% more than one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious hit at the level of the pro-investment government's policy since the government took over in the month of last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City succeeds to cross the entire Bridgeton team and walk a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to cross the Brighton team and win the Manchester City team on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to walk in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker got a step in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly through three defensive players from Brighton, before he reached the free side of the ground.
Then Aguero woke up by four players of the opposing team.
He managed to pass through a shooter, and then he crossed many other opponents on the side of the Brighton team.
After that, he took a step left, the balloon coming to Sterling.
The English attacker sent Aguero's balloon back, which hit the ring with the right foot, able to avoid it on the bridge from Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a hole on the right side of the port.
"Aguero faces some problems at the foot," said the reporters Pep Guardiola, the manager of the Manchester City team.
"I discussed with him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky to have signed a gol at that time."
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for Azuri in the Premier League game.
The gorilla came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a step deep on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he took care of Leroy Sane's left side.
Sane pulled the balloon several times until he sent Sterling's passport, which sent it to the port.
The Azuri attacker hit the balloon to the beach just before he got out of the ground.
Manchester City will meet on Tuesday, at 12:55, with Hoffeneheim in the group phase, on Rhine-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make the raids in the game against Rockies.
With the national team removed from the competition in play-off, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the game against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still involvements in the play-off for Rockies, which have an advantage with a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least an invisible place, with a 5-2 victory against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep their first title of division.
"Even if we don't play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere from here, from Denver, along with many, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the Sunday game, but according to sources, it is intended to let Scherzer take the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening of the game with number 34, had a warm-up session and will be released in normal conditions this Sunday.
Washington has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2,53 and 300 rats in 220 and 2/3 matches in this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation of a decision by the Supreme Court concerning Brett Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of the Republican presence in the interim elections.
“All our effort is in the game in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the great, not candidate, but actually candidate, so I try to support the good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrifying, radical group of Democrats, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who's hurt, who's got to push to get power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it."
This was said to be in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see this in the last four days," he added, describing Democrats as "fierces and evils, idols and liars."
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein of the Democratic Party who was a member of the Senate's Judicial Committee, which was strongly criticized by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
What?
No, um... I'm... you're a little... that was the stupidest body language I've ever seen."
The Laburist party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It didn't surprise me that Momentum activists from my local party supported the motion of censorship in my case.
As a result, I am just one of the members of the Laburist Party of Parliament who said they were not welcome, just because we expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment, because he was nervous about anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the motion of the censorship represented a criticism to my address for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, with which Jeremy had no common opinion with previous leaders.
The communication for the Nottingham East meeting of the Laburist Party states that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of the eight-year term as a member of Parliament for the Laburist Party, the GC meetings last night were like this.
Unfortunately, many of today's sittings are not in this way, and the promise of a "better, happier" political environment has been long forgotten if it has ever been respected.
It has become more evident that the different opinions are not tolerated in the Laburist Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of what is accepted by the party's conduct.
Things began to be like when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common view of politics began to expect me to change my way of thinking and agree with some things that I would not have agreed before, namely national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, regardless of what I say, it follows a wave of abuses on the separatist networks that call for my removal from the party, denying central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Laburist Party.
And I'm not the only person who's faced with this.
In fact, I know I'm more lucky than my colleagues, because my comments about my person tend to be political.
I am impressed by professionalism and the determination that I give proof to my colleagues who face a sexual or racist abuse, but they keep their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political era is the fact that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Laburist Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different points of view in the party, and with each reason of censorship or change of selection rules, the party becomes less flexible in this respect.
Many people have advised me in the last two years to put my head down, not to be so loud, and everything "will be fine" like that.
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Since I joined the Laburist Party, 32 years ago, when I was a student, I was moved by the fact that the lack of the government that gave evidence of thatcher has led to my class persecution, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including the last elections.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues that are not in agreement with current leadership are unclear.
People who have supported the movement of Friday can only say that, in the context where the country is headed to Brexit, what will affect our economies, business and local services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laburist Party.
But the only message I want to deliver is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Laburist Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of removal from the party or political opportunity will stop me from making decisions that you consider to be in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the classrooms
Despite the fact that two recent attempts have influenced a kind of final outcome, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the extremely interactive game today from Tennent's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the class, being the only team without any brakes from the ten.
In the end, everything was reflected in their best defense, as well as in the fact that they enjoyed more of the chances of appearance, which helped the gas team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to more tests during our games until now and we continue to be innocent, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The Marys agree with the Ayr team, they have benefited from more than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage to the Ayr team, but a Galben cardon received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, this playing on the Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformed attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even at half the game, managed to sign, and then managed to transform an individual trial, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at a break.
But Melrose started the second very well rehearsal, and Patrick Anderson's version of Baggot's transformation reduced March to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was expelled from the ground with targa, and since the reopening of the game, Ayr was released through the attempt of player Stafford McDowell, transformed by Climo.
Captain Ayr's team, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow cardboard and again, the Merrose team made him pay the reservation player with an untransformed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a full pressure.
However, the gas team recovered, and when Sruan Hutchinson received a yellow cardboard because he liked Climo without mega, MacPherson managed to march, offering the Ayr team's advantage.
Climo transformed the test, as he did near the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" movement and sent Gregor Henry's extreme in the depths for the fifth attempt of the team.
View of the Still Game website seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, director of the Still Game site, seems ready to move into the hospital industry after he found out that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The man, at the age of 56, plays Jack Jarvis's role in the popular BBC show, writing his scenario and playing with his long-term partner, the comedy actor Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the next series, the new number, will be the last, and Kieman seems to plan his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of the Afförmorn Limited company.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would be involved in "the restaurant development industry".
"The Sea is ours": Bolivia Island hopes that the forum will open its way to the Pacific
The mariners patrol a ship's seat full of macarals in La Paz.
Public buildings tree the white-colored star, like the ocean.
The ships from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
Along Bolivia, which is not far away, the memory of a lost coast in Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century is still alive – just as the desire to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are likely at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia expects a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary progress, a spirit of unity and holiness and, of course, looks forward to the outcome with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on major screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will make a decision in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the capital, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the presidential charismatic of Bolivia – who faces a controversial fight for the re-election of the next year – also has a lot of winning since the month's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that there would be little change if it happened.
The UN body of the Netherlands has no power to agree on the territory belonging to Chile and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of the possible discussions.
The fact that ICJ's decision comes only six months after the final hearing, indicates that this case was "not complicated," said the Chilean expert at international law.
And not only that Bolivia didn't succeed, but it's possible the last four years to get it back.
"The problem of large access has been interrupted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' blessed return has weakened any Chilean residency goodness, suggested it.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a given moment, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not replaced Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making process of the court was quickly ignored.
The day of the month will bring to Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "complete the 139 years of mutual disadvantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that, Morales – another of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up on the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't take place if it can't be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's Foreign Minister, said his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons if it can't trust Washington.
He talked about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made during a Singapore summit with the leaders of rivals.
His comments came in the context of which US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the point of relaunching diplomatic action on nuclear threat after more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
He stated that it is an "irrenal vision" such as the continued sanctions and the United States' object in relation to the declaration concerning the end of the Korean war to make the territory of the north ever surrender.
Washington has reservations to agree with the declaration without the Phenian taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are a lot of exceptions that don't think that Phineus has a serious intention to give up on the arsenal in which the country considers him the only way to secure his own security.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends with regard to flags and will be available in recent stores
If you are looking for some branches to extend your collection or fully protect you from the sun, you must no longer search.
Fashion Creators Valentino and Thom Browne searched for participants on Saturday Fashion from Paris, launching a series of top-sized and extravagant banners for their spring-war 2019 collection.
The practical steps have crossed the Instagram platform in this evening, and fashion makers have sent the creatures that steal their eyes on the podium.
The resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagance, color and, with a large bar, similar to a pen, in which the heads of models were raised.
Other oversized accessors have included margarine-contained pins, a spinal cord and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head against the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, at the time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had costumes and brought more to Hannibal Lecter's unique accessory, and did not wear a high suit.
One of the creatures seemed to be a sculpture equipment, having a oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be a hot dog.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a clothing style, with oversized clothing articles, you're lucky.
Stylists recommend a return of huge bottles in luxury fashion stores.
The super-dimensions come back after the appearance of La Bomba, the pier with a large bar, seen all over the world from Rihanna and to Emily Rattakowski.
The return of the rather practical flag which appeared on all socialisation networks caused the appearance of another oversized creature on the podium, respectively, of the peoples of the beach, with a size as large as the model of the bathing suit that holds it.
Raffle Portuguese genates, with raffles of raffles and a hand of white skin, was the part of the first-ever collection of the 2019 "La Riviera" of Jacquemus on the 7th Mode of Paris
The visualist Luke Armitage declared for the F.D.: "I expect to see hair and beach people oversized in luxury stores in the next summer, because the fashion creator had such a strong impact that it will be difficult to ignore the request for superior access."
John Edward: Language Skills, Essential for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland hold a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results for the examination, which is supported by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other Community efforts.
With over 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are seeking to provide services to their students and parents at the highest level.
Independent schools are proposing to prepare students for high school education, chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As a educational sector that can begin and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak in his own language, the words will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can only rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the classes, with the largest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a High-grade A certificate.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher A certificate in Mandarin; 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish received such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will need, certainly, in the future.
Now, foreign languages, like matter, remain like STEM subjects (scientific science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Commission for the occupation of the labour force and skills in 2014 found that, for the reasons that employers gave them for the fight against the occupation of vacations, 17% were attributed to a lack of linguistic competence.
Therefore, more and more, language skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With more opportunities for jobs that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such skills throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically place a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a poll made by YouGov over 4,000 adults from the British Sea in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by two percent of the figures, 15%.
Therefore, investment in foreign language education is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing countries with economies, children will have greater opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will produce other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more modern classical languages, while others will learn the languages that are considered the most important to the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more choice languages in independent schools, with educational frameworks that are specialized in this area.
Independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of their future.
It cannot be denied at this moment, in a global business environment, that languages remain vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it well (Trebuie made).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's gonna take the lead at Lakers Sunday, in San Diego.
Waiting is almost over for the boys who want to see LeBron James as he starts for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers team coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening of the Sunday press against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's gonna play still to set up.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James will probably play only limited minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers program of six games in the press.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need games in the press to prepare for me," he said.
Now Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, Virginia, West.
This is the first of the five rounds of Trump programmed next week, which includes stops where the elector is favourable, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote for the candidate's election for the Supreme Court's free place is suspended temporarily, Trump wants to strengthen support for the future elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
In what hour will Trump's election meeting in West Virginia take place in the evening and where can I follow him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast time, Sunday, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's electoral match in West Virginia through the live video stream below, on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate to the Supreme Court, hearing that has become tense because of the sexual misconduct charges, while the vote for confirmation of the Senate is suspended for a week, so that the FBI will investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of talks is to help the Republicans, who face tough elections in November, win a bit of land.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five summits next week is "energy for volunteers and supporters, while the Republican tries to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and in the Chamber of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control over the Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel as many states as possible before entering the very agglomerated campaign season," said Reuters a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not want to be named.
Scheduled to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the meeting this evening could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the media in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits Virginia of West, the state in which he won the elections at a 40 per cent difference in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the investigations.
"The fact that the president came to try to promote him in the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cupa Ryder 2018: US team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple trials that begin Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it is possible that the test of Saturday afternoon was exactly what Cupa Ryder needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sport world, but players really believe in it, with so much more in the case of competitions like this.
So, where's their motivation now?
"They led us with six points, now the difference is only four points, so we are based on this decline for a little reason," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with an advance of four points, when there are still twelve points in the game.
Americans, say Spieth, feel that the game is starting to change into their favor and that there are some encouraging reasons, among which is the most important form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won each three of the four points.
Spieth sent the rogues to the green area with a random precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those wedding bells became even more thrilling as they ran forward, especially when he entered a crucial point through which he re-readed the score in the four-point match, after he and Thomas were led with two points after the first two holes.
The fight by which he won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar urture, a urture that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just need to concentrate and just worry about your own game," Spieth says.
So many other players left.
18 games to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, though devout, couple of Europeans won four games and it seems that I can't make a mistake.
"Molywood" was the only reason they didn't need any extra hit next Saturday morning, but this statement is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the new points of Friday morning.
This performance and the way their energy seems to run around and inside the enthusiastic audience reinforces the idea that they will be the most dangerous Sunday players. No player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if it would lead to a successful victory for Europeans when the sun will rise over Le Golf National.
It's preferable, both at the same time, to different places.
The debate on the glory of the Europeans remains too late.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed by Sergio Garcia, the hero in the morning at the Fourballs trial, when he made a party with Alex Noren.
An additional hit and two doubles in the first nine holes were ground on the Spaniard and Sweden in a cave so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, nobody will be safe.
The samples of furballs and fursomes are fascinating and worthy of nearly due to interactions between dogs, dates and dates and the manner in which a strategy can be modified at the place.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this forum session has shown and that the US team has the motivation to continue fighting, which some, especially those in the United States, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 on the final day of Cupe Ryder
Europe begins the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after it ended its holiday games and Saturdays with a 10-6 advantage in front of the United States.
The inspiration composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two victims to an uneven Tiger Woods, which has increased their score so far to Le Golf National at four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to recover the trophies he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made a lot of mistakes in the morning exercise and won the series with score 3 to 1.
The U.S. has opposed a more serious resistance to the forum test, where he won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 simple Sunday games to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European news to win four rounds, and together with Molinari, a super-named "Molliwood" party after a sensitive weekend, are the second party that wins four points from the four opening games throughout the history of Cupe Ryder.
After they threw Woods and Patrick Reed into the fireballs trial, they were superseded to defeat Woods and American novelists Bryson Dechambeau with a very clear score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two Saturday games, had occasional genius skiings, but so far it has lost 19 out of 29 out of the 29 outlets and fursoms, of which seven were consecutive fights.
Justin Rose, who retired during the morning's exercise session, returned with partner Henrik Stanson in the field trial and confronted him with 2-1 on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe, however, did not have a course without obstacles on this pleasant and rich day in southern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the final for the Americans, winning two Saturdays.
They managed to win with 2-1 a match against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the Foreballs trial, then they came back and hit Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 to 3 in the Forsosome trial, after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cupe Ryder managed a team to recover a deficit of four points in simple trials, though, because they are the current holders of the trophies, Furyk's players need only a fair result.
However, after they were on the second floor for two days, a Sunday contract seems unlikely.
North Korea states that there is no "no chance" to defeat unilaterally as long as there is no confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen distrust in the United States and that it would not be possible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared the annual General Assembly of the Global Council that in North Korea "significant measures have been implemented to prove good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and testing rockets, decommissioning nuclear testing and non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no appropriate response from the US," he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities and, in such circumstances, we can't destroy the first ones unilaterally."
Although Ri has rejected North Korea's family objectives about the resistance of Washington to a "exhaustible" approach to the denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it made the past steps, its declaration seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as had done the Phoenicians in the past.
It referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during a summit between a US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to making progress towards a "nuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security assurances about North Korea's security.
North Korea has been looking for an official end of the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has said that it must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington did not make requests for relief of international heavy sanctions imposed by North Korea.
"The US insists on the 'first denuclearization' option and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, which is even aimed at 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The impression that sanctions can masquerading us is an illusion that only people do not know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri has not mentioned the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump referred to by US leader to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korean President for the last five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the Korean peninsula's denuclearization would not have been in this step."
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he declared for the United Nations General Assembly that it is inevitable that the US territory with rockets in North Korea is held after "Mr. Tromp called Kim a "mo-rachet" in a sinuscious mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", urged Kim to encourage the launch of the disarmament process, but she explained that the work was just starting and that sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday, Trump stated that there is no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two or three years or five months. ”
China and Russia say that Phinean should be repaid by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated to the UN Security Council: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be valid and without delay until we obtain complete, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed by North Korea beginning in 2006, in an attempt to block the funds for nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles of the Phoenicians.
Pompeo met with Ri on the colors of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't have any good results.
When he left Phinean in July, he said that progress had been made, but after just a few hours, North Korea reported that it had done "gangsterese amenations".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to demonstrate a range of launching rockets and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "responsive measures".
This said Kim told him that the "relevant measures" they were looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised them in Singapore and that he wanted to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses on how to relax enough.
A new class at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the culture of "macho" in growth, which makes it possible for them to be subjected to “all night” learning sessions, with a lot of caffeine.
A man of science discovered that, in addition, students of the most prestigious universities in the world do not even master the basic concepts of the way they should care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type of U.S.
This was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleep loss on learning ability.
"In the end, a girl came and said to me, "Why is this said to me now, last year?"
She told me she never talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she said for The Telegraph.
The course, introduced earlier this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously private during the week.
The course that lasts an hour may involve a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, the picture of a room is presented, and students can click on coffee dogs, lose, sports pants and cards to tell them that the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance are affected by sleeplessness, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants have been told how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain attacks, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
"We know we can't change the students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as everyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, says it, adding that modern technology and the pressure of students have transformed sleep privacy into a problem in growth.
The sound, of a good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student for the fight of stress, anxiety and anxiety, said it, even to avoid the growth of weight, because the vision of sleep makes the brain believe that the body is formed, which makes students feel it is constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course, after participating in one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
This said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all the students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study programme before joining this competition institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to schedule a alarm to know when it is time to wake up, as well as for hours of wakefulness, and to know what the negative effects of the "white light" emitted by the electronic and LED screens, which may disturb the circular rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to accept it.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's gol on Gerrard's team
Rangers suffers from another case of depression in displacement because Dolly Menga's beating condemned Steven Gerrard's unconventional team at a 1-0 strike in Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to get the first victory to move from the triumph with 4--1 won in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to administer Gerrard's second 18-game flanges as coach, which makes Rangers eight-pointed after Hearts, the leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga enrolled seven minutes before the break and the non-inspired players from Rangers did not appear in any way equal.
Rangers fell so on the sixth position in class, while Livingston hit the third place, in the rear of the Hibernian, at a different angle.
And Rangers could also face other problems, because the Calum Spence shower cabinet had to be treated for a wound at the head level after an object was, it seems, thrown into the side of the visiting team's fan.
Gerrard has changed eight players from the ball that won easily against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get a match with Hearts last week and has all the reasons to be proud of the way his ball was well-instructed and focused on the opponent on the game.
Even if Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston had more efficient use of the cells they had.
He should have walked in just two minutes after the game started, when Menga's first step proposed Scott Pittman to the defense gate by Allan McGregor, but the middleman missed a very good opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs has found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, sent him to the bar.
Rangers took control, but they left the impression that more hope than they believed in their game in the last three games.
Alfredo Morelos sincerely believed that he should have received a sentence when he had sex with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
Rangers had only two hits on the gate in the first rehearsal, but the former porter from Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was not quite disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although the 34-minute gorilla in Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, either for the effort it took.
Again, Rangers couldn't prevent Jacobs' deep center.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ring, who kept his calm and passed Menga, who ended up with a simple hit.
Gerrard acted on the break when he changed Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this move almost gave him a job right away, when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressionant Kelly went out of his shoes to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors exactly the same type of game he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett, who intercepted centers after the center.
Holt's team would have been able to extend the advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' fighting, then Lithgow sent his head to the corner of the church fighting.
Glenn Middleton, who booked at Rangers, asked a criminal at the end of the game, when he hit Jacobs, but again, Thomson didn't agree.
Almanah: Geiger accountant
And now, a page from our German Sunday morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago (and CONTINUE Number...), is the day in Germany, the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that led to the creation of the device known as Geiger.
An essential provision for science since then, Geiger became essential to the pop culture, as in the "Clopotes of San Coronado" (1950), where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played in the role of cowlboys with unlikely scientific clonings:
The man said, "What else is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger account used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these rocks, you can hear the effects of the atoms released from radioactive activity in the minerals."
Evans said: "Yes, a great multitude of deaf people hear!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" the harmful cells and destroy them
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
Method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their transformation into a laboratory
These can "detect" a common protein many cancers and then re-inject
A test vaccine provides promising results for patients with a cancer range.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of the immune cells from a patient, their transformation into the laboratory in such a way that it can "detect" a common protein called HER2, then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have to do it with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "determines the growth of many types of cancer", including blood, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to take the immune cells out of patients and to "learn" them to end cancer cells, has also worked for the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held Trump's support diaphragm while wearing a MAGA hat, after the SNL appearance.
He didn't come out too well.
Kanye West was shocked at a study during the Saturday Night Live issue after a detoured show that attracted US President Donald Trump and said he was trying to apply for the 2020 elections.
After he interpreted the third song, Ghost Town, during which he wore a jacket Make America Great, the artist withdrew into a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed support for Trump.
"Many times when I'm talking to a white person, I'm asked, "How do you like Trump? He's racist."
Well, if I'd been worried about racism, I'd have been moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene in which Matt Damon played, where Hollywood's star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual aggression committed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's diaphragm film was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock's trying to get him over to the West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems in the streets because of his wife.
"I've tried to scare me into the hills.
They said to me, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I've been attacked!
They already told me we're very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how much I got down?" Then he said, "I'll take Superman's manpower, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try with love."
His comments drew Jews from the public at least twice, and SNL team members appeared to be crazy, reported Variety; a person from this team said to the publication: "In the study, there was a complete silence."
West was invited as a replacement for the last hour for the soloist Ariana Grande, whom he was loved, the Mac Miller rapper, has died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of spruces when he interpreted the song I Love it dressed as a Perrier glass.
West was supported by the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits among us: I've been moved by GLOAT."
Karen Hunter, the boss of a show, wrote on Twitter that West was just, "he was himself and that's great."
"I choose not to reward anyone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting the art) about who I believe to dress up and express a nocturnal ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the issue, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, stating that from now on it is "the officially known village of Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; West hits Diddy's back, previously known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then "the artist known as Prince's right".
Adjudication of a murder attempt to enter a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was shot in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defence lawyer is waiting months in front of the Belfast Court.
The allegations will be analysed by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star of the thrones, attacks the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for Jon Snow's role in the violent media fantasy series of violent Tronuris Urzeal, produced by HBO.
But 31-year-old actor attacked male hero stereotypes, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes boys think they should be hard to be respected.
In an interview for The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said it seems that "there has been something wrong" and asked how the problem of toxic masculinity could be handled in the era #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his colleague in the Tournament Office, Rose Leslie, aged 31, admitted that she is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personal, I'm very determined to talk about this now: where have I been wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have I taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we are facing now?"
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is taught, and what is taught?
What does a young man learn from TV and street, and what makes him think he should be some kind of man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our times: how can we change this?
'Cause it's clear that something went wrong with young people."
In the interview, he acknowledged that he would not play any kind of series based on the Urzeal of the Thrones after the series ends in the spring of the next year, saying that "he ended with the war camps and horses".
In November, Kit will play a new production of the True West theatre by Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a poet.
The actor recently discovered that the best thing that happened to him due to the Urzeal of the Trontures series was that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I made this series, so this gave me the future of my family and my life before," said Kit.
Rose played in Ygritte's role, loved by Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of Emmy's most prizes.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, say the officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted on sexual basis, except in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced almost zero, says the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was criminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered very widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines, as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of the senators of the Republican Party, speaks of "hazardous minions" and "conspiration theories"
The representative of Maxine Waters filed on Saturday charges, according to which a member of his team provided personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that the charges are made by analysts and websites of "extreme right".
"Millions, lies and other terrible lies," Waters said in a post on Twitter.
The information disclosed included the addresses and personal phone numbers of the senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during an audit in the Senate on sexual misconduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed judge at the Supreme Court.
Information flow was short-lived after the three senators addressed Kavanaugh's questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with Waters' office and provided information to a member of the Waters team, reporting Hill.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of the team whose identity, personal information and security were committed as a result of these false charges was not in any way responsible for the falsification of these information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticised online shortly after they were made, including the former Secretary for the press at the Albe House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he does not have the necessary temperature to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
It should not be subject to the question of the accused's motive.
It has to be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by Democrats, who said he seemed a little upset during the hearing of March.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who seeks against Waters in the mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"It's important, if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office warned "the appropriate legal authorities and entities regarding these false charges.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will respond to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any member of my team."
Johnny English Resenzie resuscitate: parody without a glass of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to look for some meanings associated with Brexito in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new series of actions that he has as his main character in Johnny English, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will this overwhelming satisfaction of how strange we are to become the new opportunity to export the nation?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with the naked eyes and the dog face, was renewed for the second time the license to shoot everything. The name of the person means, first of all, that it is a general comical creation for the cinematographic public in the countries of the unprofessional English language.
He is, of course, the secret agent who, despite his claims at luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a picture by Mr. Bean and a poet of the type who contributed with a single note on the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony from London.
The person is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without the country Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV ads, which left chaos behind him.
This last adventure of JE has one or two lovely moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached an helicopter dressed in an environmental armory and the rotor's balls hit his coat easily.
The burden that Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but death is rather weak and, surprisingly, superfluous, especially because the films “serious” such as the 007 series or the impossible Mission offer with confidence comeding moments.
The murder seems to address more children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as adventures and smart as Atkinson's moving movie gags when playing in the role of Bean.
As usual, the premise is always that Great Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's supersecret spy network and has revealed the identity of English agents undercover, leading to the disappearance of the service agent, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last painting for a prime minister and under a seat, who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the loss of political popularity: Emma Thompson does all he can with his own character, Theresei May, but the scenario does not give him a chance to wake up.
Its consultants in the field of secret information inform it that all active spies have been compromised, so that an agent found in the reserve must be activated.
This is Johnny English's own dress, now working as a teacher in a school for the upper class, which gives lessons about how to be an agent undercover. Here are some nice guys, because English runs a spy class in the School of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency seat, then he is reunited with his weather partner, Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and valuable character, the role of Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little frustrated.
So, these Batman and Robin have created jobs in the Secret Service of His Majesty, they return to action, enjoying the beautiful girl Ophelia Bulletin, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is in the hands of a billion-dollar charisma of the technology industry who claims to be able to solve the IT problems of the British Mary: Jason Volta sistrol, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough poresc in a view of the bourgeois adventures: divested into chains, I fire a French restaurant in fashion, create chaos as they cross the Volta luxury boat, then English decants anarchy in shape when he tries to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to meet with the interior of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but whether it was a beautiful and colorful film, it looks like a television production for children.
A movie that's kind of mediocre.
As in other movies with Johnny English, I can't stop asking myself: can't even the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinson a role in his talent?
The workers deny that they are planning to work four days a week, but to be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Laburist party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work for four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It appears that the party wants the heads of companies to benefit from the possible economies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) while giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the wage would not have been changed.
The sources say that the idea would be "sustained" with the party's economic programme, which wants to close the balance in favour of the workers.
The four-day work week is supported by the Trade Union Congress in a way that workers can benefit from the change in the economy.
A source of the Laburist Party’s leadership stated for The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a political review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen over the night, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspirations for the economic re-balanced party for the employer, as well as for the general industrial strategy."
The Laburist Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the promises of the Green Party in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this ambition is not supported by the entire Laburist Party.
A spokesman for the Laburist Party stated: "Seven days' work is not a party's policy and is not taken into account."
John McDonnell, the Chancellor's mayor of Umbor, took advantage of the last week's conference of volunteers to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to take back the power from "unfronted directors" and "professionals" from the utility companies.
The plans of the Channel Lord of the Umbrella cabin also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regions could not recover their shares in full, as the Laburist government could perceive "deductives" due to identified offences.
It also confirmed the plans to appoint employees in company management councils and to create property funds through which it allocates up to 10% of its own capital from private sector firms to employees, which will receive such annual dividends up to approximately 500 lire.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the "60 Minutes" issue if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make him reflect
An investigation by the FBI of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh raised the final vote on his application as a judge in the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question if the Republican senators could be convinced that he would no longer support him because of the FBI findings.
In a Sunday-discharged interview, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make him reflect.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," says Kennedy.
"I said this from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges appeared, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, promptly, without fault."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be in the rock.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so there would be some explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejects the charges with the decision," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“Not one of the persons mentioned by it has confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something's going to change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This evening, New York will host the Global City Festival, an annual musical event that will take part in an impressive age group, with a mission as impressive as that: eliminating world poverty.
In addition to the seventh edition, the Global Citizens' Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park pool, not only to follow artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise the level of awareness of the true nature of the event, eliminating extreme poverty until 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Peace Project, an international group of lawyers who hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive an event-free ticket (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the spectators had to purchase a series of tasks or "actions", such as voluntary sending e-mails to world leaders, making calls or other significant calls that would help raise awareness of global poverty eradication.
But what happened when I was only 12 years old to reach the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case called "clictivism", a concept that refers to people who feel that they have made a request online or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered in 2011 by its supporters, which have promoted different objectives.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies with a value of more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements due to its actions, with at least 10 billion dollars already spent or lost.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with the headquarters in the UK of investors and intermediaries who have committed themselves to "help children grow up to their full potential", which has promised Rwanda to provide $35 million to contribute to the eradication of malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 messages on Twitter from global citizens.
"With the help of the British Government, the donors, the national governments and other global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition only a footnote in the history book," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of many during a live concert in London, April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been carried out in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the project The Power of Nutrition, which will ensure food interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequent questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and make mistakes.
But, like the great movements of civil rights or anti-participation that have taken place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée is counted by artists who will sing this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the ship's forces for a "block" that would aggregate Russia's energy exports, said the Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to the ship forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's engagement in Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why I am in the Middle East is that I want to intervene in energy sales, as I do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are keys and methods to manage the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our ship's forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a block, so that energy does not go out on the market," he said.
Zinke is addressed to participants to an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
This continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practical the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia that "he knows one trick" because of the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of natural gas in Europe to replace Russia, the most cheap option for European consumers.
In this sense, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "independable" project of the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would transform Berlin into a "prisoner" in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly highlighted the fact that the 11 billion-dollar project of North Stream 2 would double the current driving capacity at 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin stated that the US's fierce opposition to the project is promoted for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that in the same way: energy cannot be an instrument by which pressure is placed and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Alexander Novak, Russia's Minister of Energy after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Secretary for Energy in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation of Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state intervenes in matters of our energy," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously" to apply to the 2020 presidential elections, says Senator of Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said he had to "think seriously" if he would apply to the presidential elections after the mid-term election.
During the first meeting of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidate.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that's why a strong woman is needed," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously think if I apply to the presidential elections."
Warren had something to say about President Donald Trump during the spring meeting, saying that he "directed the country in a wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published by Joi showed that the majority of Warren's members don't think they should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidate.
The probe has shown more support for a former Governor Deval Patrick's candidate: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% are opposed.
Other names of very well-known democracies that could be applied in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and of Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress syndrome that suffers from Track Palin at a meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he was born in September.
Last night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"The lights through which my own son, who passed away after his return... can understand the suffering of other families who feel the limitations of posttraumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the injuries our soldiers return," said the audience gathered at a meeting of support from Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of this “elevated elephant” and said that her son and other war veterans “will return a little different, more difficult, asking if there is more respect for what they and their troops from the armed forces and aircraft, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country.”
This was arrested for months in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of a domestic violence act and the possession of a fire weapon in Hebrew, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Department of Police in Wasilla.
18 states and the Columbia District answers a new asylum request policy
Eightteen states and the Columbia District support a legal challenge of the new US politicians who refuse to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape from the violence caused by finders or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District have completed a friendly request on Friday in Washington to support a political dispute on asylum seekers, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union organisation launched in August against federal policy has not been discovered.
It said that her partner "his violent sons, members of a find", abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was kept in Texas.
The state-owned lawyer who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, right countries facing a generalized problem with homelessness and violence.
The new US asylum policy has cancelled a 2014 Council decision on Immigration Appeals that has allowed immigrants without acts that try to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
General Prosecutor of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, stated on Friday that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"The federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a restriction violates this principle," wrote a friend of the Kuriae petition.
In addition, lawyers argue that the policy that refuses immigrants' entry affects the U.S. economy, saying it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "give the necessary labour force".
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered judges in June for immigration cases not to agree with victims who are trying to escape the abuse and violence of the villages.
"Azil is welcomed by those who leave their country free of persecution or fear because of racial discrimination, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, when he announced politics.
The role of asylum was never to solve all the problems facing people every day in the world, nor even all the serious problems.
Save operations expected in Palu, where the number of deaths has doubled, in a course against the cronometer to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become even more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who links her baby to a refugee center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Possible water is not enough."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and to organize their wells, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 on Richter scale, were overstated.
Some of the wounds, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the vertebral column and in pain, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated in free air due to strong and continuous replications.
This has eyes full of tears when she remembers how she felt the violent nightmare surrounding the hotel room at the fifth floor where she shared with her wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," said Haris for Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a night.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then just shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "abuses" "propagandistics"
A week after an official newspaper from China published a four-page statement in a US daily in which the US-China trade exchanges benefit from mutual benefits, US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to distribute propaganda material.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the compliments paid by China in Des Moines Register, the best selling newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of joining in the 6 November elections for Congress, a charge China rejects.
The claim that Beijing is trying to join the US elections marked what U.S. officials have declared to Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington scale campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish complaints that promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war involving rising import prices.
The rates imposed by China as a dispute, at the beginning of the commercial war, were created to affect exporters of state like Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said experts from China and the USA.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and was governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing was injured by American workers, farmers and business people.
In a daily edition published in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "keeps this abuse by publishing advertisements in our own free press".
"When distributing propaganda by publishing a statement in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition so valuable in America of freedom of expression and free press," writes Branstad.
"In exchange, on the streets of Beijing, you will find a few voices of the dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the varying views that Chinese citizens have about the worrying economic tragedy of China, since mass media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say what newspaper is talking about.
The Republican aligns women's vote before the elections in the middle of the mandate due to the Kavanaugh scandal, warns analysts
Because many of the top republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, from more sexual abuse charges, analysts have warned that there will be a conflict, especially among women, during the future elections of half of the mandate.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and the majority of the Republicans who discussed it intend to continue the vote.
"These reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that the recent initiative of Senator Jeff Flake (rapporteur of Arizona) on an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget tomorrow and they won't forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and spokesman for the national press, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors scand "november wine!" while showing the Senate halls when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process in spite of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, told Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participating political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially through female indistinguishable sex voters and young electorate, between 18 and 29 years of age, who, although not joining the president, are not voting anymore."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the allegations of sexual abuse brought by the nominalist to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it might be counterproductive if the Republican continued the confirmation process.
"This has become a public strike," said Michael Steele, who was president of the National Republican Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NCB News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but also how the Republicans dealt with this situation and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA's Priorities, an electoral support group for the message channel.
However, the Americans seem to be relatively divided about the party they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's comments: a little more seems to believe it later.
A new poll carried out by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe with courage or believe that Ford's testimony is likely to be true, while 35% said that he believed with courage or that it is likely that Kavanaugh's testimony to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford stated under oath in front of the Senate's judicial committee that Kavanaugh abused her, as a Hebrew, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominalist at the Supreme Court exposed the genital organs in front of her when they attended a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, launchs a start that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest legend project in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a solid-based company, the open-source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data archives" or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in a single browser, all at once.
What's unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal data-consolidation".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt is to contribute with adequate resources, processes and skills, in such a way as to make Solid available to the whole world.
At present, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team do not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a complete change when their business models are fully dataed over the head one time.
"We do not ask permission."
In a post published on Wednesday evening, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after they launch Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this being the next Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The church that won the Victoria Cross in World War I is celebrating
The only church in the Church of England who won a medal Crucea Victoria's right to fight in World War I was celebrated in its homeland after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the Bellenglis and Lehacourt attack.
This was killed by a mooneer four days later, and he never knew that he was found the highest military honor of the British Mary.
A monumental stone was discovered on Saturday by his two people during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of the peoples, Michael Vann, said he's "little symbolic" the fact that the stone will be revealed 100 years after the fact that his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the battalion over the Canal of Saint-Quentin "with a very high heat and under the intense fire of the artillery and metals."
Later, he quickly got to the front line and, with "an amazing bravado", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked a single piece of artillery and managed to remove three of the weapons of detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German lunetist on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were “a thing I know I will never be equal to, but that makes me feel ashamed.”
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also dropped a crown after the parade, which was led by Orchestra by Lieutenant Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said that "it feels very honorable to play a role in the paradise" and added that "the value of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that many people agree with."
The MMA fans stayed all night to see Bellator 206, but they got animated drawings with Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that you've been trying to follow Bellator 206 all night, an event with many stars, just so you can't follow the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main board, and had to be delivered alive all night in the British Sea on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, exactly when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to meet Rory MacDonald, the viewers of the British Sea were surprised when the message was replaced with an episode in Peppa Pig.
Some were not very grateful, because they stayed three all night watching the war.
A fan described the transition to the animated design for children to “a kind of stupid joke. ”
"Governmental regulations say that this content is not appropriate for 6 o'clock in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked about transmission.
"Peppa, yes."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator's company, said that, in the future, they will programme their events in such a way that they can be followed by British spectators.
"When I think about the protests, I think we could probably solve," said Coker.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do this until Sunday, our hour, or the months, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started to receive a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical discharge.
But it wasn't about that, it was about a government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to go back to five wars instead of six, as we usually do.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
Olympic dignitary Tom Daley says he grew up feeling that he was the least because of his sexuality, but this led him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said that he had only accomplished when he came to school that “not everyone is like me. ”
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs issue presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, she said she was talking about the rights of gay people to give them another "sustainment".
The sport said more and that when he became a parent, he had less of the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the traditional emission, will be missing a few months because of a disease.
Invited in the first edition of Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child, he felt “lower” to others because“ he was not socially acceptable to me to like boys and girls."
He said, "These feelings of inferiority and the fact that I was different have been the real things that gave me the strength and resistance to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he is “someone”, he declared, so that he would not disappoint the whole world when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The winner of the two bronze medals at the Olympic Games has become a known supporter of the LGBT campaigns and has benefited from the appearance of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to ask more countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without restraint, and because he wanted to give the other "sustainment".
The World Championship said "was taken by surprise" because he loved a man, American Chinese Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year to the winner of the Oscar Award, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you pass through so many to such a weak age," he participated in the first Olympic when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who would have passed through the same good and bad times.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, says Daley, changed "the whole perspective."
"If I had been asked last year, I wouldn't have been interested in anything but to win a gold medal," he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than the gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears his father’s name, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that after he died and that one of the last things he wanted to find out if he received tickets for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him "You can't be first," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and immediately after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that I wanted to spend my whole life in front of the spectators of my country at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in the choice music, the Heart Small Proud, which encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still stimulates him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday, at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was transferred to the reserve bank on Saturday at Cupa Ryder.
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record Saturday, when he's playing in the fourties and seven games from Cupa Ryder, but he's gonna have to go back to a good shape so that it won't be an unpleasant occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the binary event for the twentieth time, another record, was transferred to the reserve bank of Captain Jim Furyk for the drills and Saturdays.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it was many times for the United States team, the winner of major tournaments divided the day between being major for co-herders and carrying out the fighting, with the hope that he would correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player had never had the right drivers, not even in the best period of his career, so it's not the best choice for Le Golf National land, where long-distance rough areas still predispose the wrong hunts.
And if the ground isn't a great challenge, in the new game of Sunday Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the methic champion of British Open, who joined the news Tommy Fleetwood and won all the four games of the week.
Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial to the Americans, leading four points to entry into the 12 simple games, which must begin with force at this stage.
Furyk said he trusted his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, beat me, dressed me and told me he'd be ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed very much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I figured out more, but that's what happened, and that's the way we thought we had to go.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most of the games played in Cupa Ryder.
This could be the end of his career in Cupa Ryder, which no longer grew up in his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 matches won, 20 lost and seven percent, although Furyk said his presence has brought some incredible benefits to the team.
"It's funny, it's sercastic, smart, it likes to play with the players, it's a wonderful guy in the team's vet," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see them doing this during the week.
His role is more important, not just in the game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that considerable progress could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the considerable progress made before the first day of simple trials in Cupa Ryder can easily be transformed into an uncomfortable journey.
The damage started in the game from 1997 to Valderrama, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if it managed to break them with a minimum difference, from 1411⁄2 to 1311⁄2.
"I remember that I had a considerable advance in Valderrama; I had a big advance and in Brooklyn, where I lost, and in Valderram, where I could only win," said Bjorn (in the picture) after following the team from 2018, which won with 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, and now leads with 10-6 Le Golf National.
"So, history shows me, me and my team, that it's not ready yet.
We have to play at the maximum speed tomorrow.
Let's get out of the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready unless the points are passed on to the table.
We have a goal and this is to win this trophie, it must remain the target.
I've always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know what we expect in the other part: the best players in the world."
Curious about the way his players worked on a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I don’t rush to draw conclusions.
It's all different tomorrow.
Tomorrow are important individual performances, and this is different.
It's great to be on the ground with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested at maximum, as a golf player.
This is the message you have to send to the players, that it must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now leave their partner behind and have to play as well."
In addition to Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the rebel team, hopes his players will play better in a simple test than they did with the partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself was both parties to such returns in the last day: he was in the winning team from Brooklyn, then in the losers when Europe won the "Miracle from Medina".
"Remember every word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick victories, like at Brooklyn, like at Medina.
When tension develops in a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those games from the middle.
We've created the corresponding slot and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was dragged to lead the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans from the second half of the programme.
"I have chosen this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all the subjects," Bjorn said about the battalion for simple proof.
The new war path of Germany, again
The newest task force of Germany's ships would have to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old war waves in the Red War, but this will only happen in the year, due to poor systems and growth costs, has reported local pressure.
The entry into operation of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", a standardized ship of the new class of bats Baden-Wuertmberg, was now launched until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which reads a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but the problems encountered after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four bays of the Baden-Wuertemberg class that Marina Military ordered in 2007 will replace the old flag of the Bremen class.
They are expected to be provided with a strong tunnel, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas, as well as steel technology, which ensures a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic printing.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new entrants to be able to leave for missions for two years without returning to the initial port.
However, the delays continue to mean that these last generation war zones, which are said to increase Germany's maritime force, will be already old before entering the service, notes Die Zeit.
The Ghinionist F125 was discussed last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina Military returned a building vessel after delivery.
There is not much information available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media has read a number of cross-border "software and hardware" that would have made the warship useless in a war mission.
Software deficits were particularly important because the Baden-Wuertmberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 mariners, only half of the older crews in Bremen class.
In addition, it has been demonstrated that the vessel has too much weight, which has reduced its performance and limited the capacity of the Military Sea to add future supplies.
It is believed that the 7000 tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as difficult as the German vessels used in the Second World War.
Alongside the defective mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including the training of the team, became a cause of concern.
This is said to have reached the first figure of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), at the initial price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the new ones are of particular importance in view of the latest warnings that say the maritime power of Germany is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that Marina Military had "started to remain unarmed which could be sent to missions".
The official said that the problem was growing constantly over time, because the old vass had been removed from function without being replaced with some of the new ones.
This is because none of the bats of the Baden-Wuertemberg class have entered into operation within the Military Marine.
National Trust Spills the Secret Life of Lilies
We research that are carried out on a Scottish Highlands property will reveal how they use the exciting environment to win the prize.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these burning mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by National Trust for Scotland's scientists will analyze common smallpox and pigment lilies, as well as earaches and water lilies from the Inverwe Gradinile Inverwe from West Ross.
Special recording equipment will be deployed in key locations around the property to monitor the activity of the leagues during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will perform mobile studies using manual detection.
A specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of the songs made by lily and what species emit certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of the room and a report, to create a detailed picture, at the bottom, of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, an consultant on the conservation of nature for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are the most important for lilies and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the housing management work, such as the creation of gas, and which is the best way to maintain forestland for lily and other associated species.
The populations of cuts from Scotland and the whole Great Britain have fallen significantly in the last century.
These are risks of construction and development work that affect the doors, but also the loss of the room.
And electric turbines and public lighting are risks, just as they are muscle caps and some chemical treatments for construction materials, but also domestic fish attacks.
In fact, the lilys aren't the worlds.
However, due to the fact that they spend the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it's about to be caught.
They use a sophisticated ecosystem technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTSC, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about the lilies.
These have ten trained experts, who conduct periodic studies, control the doors and, sometimes, perform rescue missions.
The organization has even created the first and only reservation of Scotia lily, on the Thrave Museum in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of lilac are found in Scotland.
The mouse manager, David Thompson, says that this is the ideal area for lilies.
"Here, in Threave, the area is wonderful for lilys," he says.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about lying, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need this to multiply."
This underlines the importance of looking for lilys before carrying out maintenance work on property, because simply unintended destruction of a maternal dog could kill up to 400 women and women, which can destroy the entire local population.
The lilies are protected, and killing, beating or breaking them, as well as destroying their holes, are prohibited actions.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official in Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help him.
It said: “If we have a lot of learning about lies and we don’t know how the population develops for many of our species."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of violence while lawyers prepare to give a fair trial in Germany
Christian Ronaldo said the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "will make a complaint" using his name.
Her lawyers are determined to give the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker and the Juventus team were accused of violating an American woman, identified by Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the football player paid $375.000 to not talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video clip sent on Instagram Live for its 142 million followers, Ronaldo, at the age of 33, said they are "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the winner of the Gold Ballon in front of the video camera.
"I want to make a statement using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get my name's credit, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to condemn Der Spiegel for these charges, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspects who hold private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player will ask for compensation for “an adequate moral tax for the gravity of the fact, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2009, in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where it violated anal, according to the documents from the District Court of Clark, Nevada.
Majorga claims that, after an accident, Ronaldo fell in his knees before her and said he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accused, but that they were consensus.
Majorga claims that she had been sent to the police and that her injuries had been taken to the hospital, but she also accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because she was "trembling at the possibility of a defendant" and was worried that "will be humiliated by the public".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by an accident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This evening, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: The British Sea "and regretting" the loss of car manufacturers
The British Sea "will regret it" if it loses the status of world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, said Secretary for business Greg Clark.
It added that it is "an alarming" because Toyota UK has declared to the BBC that, if the Great Britain comes out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production in its factory from Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where Auris and Aventis brands are manufactured in Toyota, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point is that, if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Executive Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car producers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid to leave the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory from Oxford where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are what producers call associated risks to the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line works on the basis of the principle of 'fix in time': for vehicles manufactured on command, the parts arrive at an interval of 37 minutes from British and EU suppliers.
If the British Sea leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be difficulties at the border, which, according to industrial producers, could lead to delays and a loss of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to deposit more than the inventory for one day at his Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said theresei May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these delays at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present day but also to enjoy this opportunity," he said for today's BBC Radio 4.
"The agreements from Toyota, and from other producers, show that we must continue to use what was a set of successful supply chains."
Toyota could not determine how long the production would have to be stopped, but warned that prices would reduce the long-term competitive capacity of the factory and would ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who works at Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the U.S. trade union, said that members are still concerned: "The experience has taught me that, after disappearing, these jobs are no longer coming back."
A government spokesman stated: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be lunched out yesterday, says House Alba
The high-level meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "more than a week," because the battle for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continued, declared the House of Alba Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who invests Russia's interferences in the elections, ties between Trump's and Russia's aid and the potential for obstructing justice by the president.
The complaints about Trump's ability to grant him to the deputy general prosecutor, thus threatening Mueller's independence, are in the search for Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president by means of amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and the reports say he was on his way out.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Joi, which is currently at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" grant Rosenstein, but then the meeting was arranged to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's legal committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave the testimony.
Vineri, Trump asked for a week's FBI investigation regarding the charges against Kavanaugh, which he reopened the vote in the Senate's plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There has not been a set time in this sense; it may be this week or may be a week, taking into account all the other matters now taking place at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll always like to hold on to the current."
Some reporters would reply to this statement: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Master Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that reducing the number of briefings was not due to the antipathy of TV reporters, who like to give in the show, though he added: "I don't deny that they like to give in the show."
Then, he suggested he'd cut the direct contact between Trump and press.
"The President participates in more meetings of questions and answers than all the previous presidents," she said, adding, without adding any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"I want more briefings," Sanders said, but "I think it's much better that the press have the opportunity to address the questions directly to the President of the United States, not me.
We're trying to do this more and you can see that we've done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the Presidents of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available."
Usually, Trump answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open sessions at each press conference with the complainants who visit him.
The press conferences arranged exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why this was happening, having an improvised appearance, on white terms, in front of the reports gathered.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) of the Scotia on Brexit-related fears
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their appreciation on behalf of the country and the desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under the terms of less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already taken the commitment to support costs for requests to receive the permanent residence status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "For the truth, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, expecting decisions to be taken this afternoon.
But the Government of the United Kingdom has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, where there would be no agreement for EU exit.
I know it's a very stressful period for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employed, regardless of nationality.
Members of the European Union, but beyond that, have a valuable experience and skills that support and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and the communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is under an emergency surgical intervention after he suffered a stroke at the head
The Tennesse State Tigers Foundation, Christion Abercrombie, was under an emergency surgery after he suffered a stroke on Saturday, where his team lost him in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with a score of 31-27, declared Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The chief coach of the Tennesse State team, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the shooting took place shortly before the break.
"He got to the shower line and just ran away," Reed said.
Abercrombie has placed a oxygen mask by the physical preparations and medical personnel on the toilet line before he is placed on a map and transported on the ground for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had departed from the operation at the Medical Vanderbilt Center.
Harris added that "there are no further details about the type/extension of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it was produced.
Abercrombie, student in the second year, is in his first season in Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
Saturday, it managed to make five payments in total before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 payments in the whole season.
Foreign buyers will be understood to receive a higher stamp court tax in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp court tax to buy a property in the United Kingdom, allowing for additional money to be used to assist people without aid, in accordance with the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
The Court of Justice shall apply to persons who are not taxable and taxable in the United Kingdom
The threshold is expected to rise to up to 120 million sterline lires per year for the aid of unaccompanied persons
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher rate of court-martial tax in purchasing a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to assist people without aid, as announced today Theresa May.
The change will be considered an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young people with voting rights, promising home with more favorable prices and visiting people with large incomes.
The higher court rate will apply to natural and legal persons who are not taxable and taxable in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help people without delay.
The ceiling, which is added to the current time court rate, including the higher levels over two years for the second property and the property purchased for the purpose of purchase, could reach a 3% value.
The treasurery is expected to bring this change to a further up to 120 million sterline readings per year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first house.
More areas of progress from the country, especially capital, have become "fathomous" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes in just a few weeks since Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the court fee to help young people buy their first house.
This accused large construction firms that maintain high ownership prices as a result of the purchase of land without using them and asked Theresa May to withdraw taxes for houses with affordable prices in order to solve the "house problems" of the British Sea.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive reform proposals in the real estate area, including control over the sharks and the halting of unwanted evacuees.
He also wants to offer advice with greater power in building new houses.
Theresa May stated: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime mission to the fulfillment of the British vision, a better life for each new generation.
And that means solving the existing problems on the real estate market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign-owned companies, to be able to buy houses as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has become too distant, and life in bad conditions is too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the national team manager of Scotland"
Jack Ross, the football team manager Sunderland, said that "the ultimate goal" is to become, at a time, the national team manager of Scotland.
The Scotian, 42 years old, enjoys the promotion of the North-East Club, which is currently located at 3 in the First League, with a difference of three points to the first place.
This evening he moved to the team at the Stadium of Light after he succeeded, last season, the return of St. Mirren's football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We arrived in the B team of the national and about that," Ross said for Sport Sound at BBC Scotland.
"But I spent a lot of my childhood following the Scotch games at Hampden together with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I'll be part of this opportunity only if I succeed as the club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as manager of the Sunderland Club, is Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of the Alloa Athletic Club said he does not have the emotion to be the successor of such dedicated names and to a club so important, after he refused offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team get back to Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities of this club allow it to be in Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to help the club come back to Premier League."
Ross has only three years of experience in driving, after a period during which he was assisted by manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alla club come back after he retired in Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from the retrograde, helping the team win the campaign title in the next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career at Clyde, Hartlepolol, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over the leadership of the Alloa club.
"I even thought that I deserved the manager's role more than the player.
It may sound strange, because I had a good time, I had a good time, and I had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
They deal with situations like manager, with stress and pressure, but I feel it's the right role for me.
I always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do this, I feel it's the best thing for me in my entire adult life."

The heat from this summer led to an increase in the revenue in the villages of the British Sea, putting more pressure on restaurants.
According to figures, villages and bars recorded an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurants' income dropped by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA that provides business consultancy services and who conducted the survey, said: “The constant heat and participation of England in the World Cup for a longer period than the preconceived one in July, like the previous month, when the villages recorded up to 2.8% more customers, while the restaurants had a longer period.
The number of customers less than 1.8% in the month of June in the restaurant industry decreased further in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have recorded a far greater profit than restaurants.
And the people who serve food have recorded the loss caused by heat, but not as big as the restaurants.
Looks like people just got out of town to consume drinks.
The sales of alcohol at all levels of bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a representative of RSM offering hospital services, said: "These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The weather conditions and the impact of sports and social enlargement events remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales of the OOH advertising market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to record losses, although sales drop by 4.8% per year will be added to current cost pressures.
Long canicule summer could not come at a much simpler moment for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the moderater temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of newly launched sites.
The company monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups, with a profit combined with more than 9 billion stereos, which is the official standard in the industrial sector.
One of five children has a secret account on a social networking network that hides parents
According to one Sunday, one of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, has a secret account on a social networking network that hides parents and teachers.
A survey conducted at the level of 20,000 Gymnasium students revealed an increase in “insta fake” accounts.
Knowing Fears of Sexual Intimacy
20% of students said they have a "primary" account showing parents
One of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a social networking network that keeps them hidden in front of adults.
A survey conducted on a number of 20,000 Gymnasium students revealed a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has fostered fear of sexual harassment.
20% of students claimed that they have a "primary" and "curate" account that parents show, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who mistakenly discovered her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret account, observed the position of a teenager who wanted to be “violent. ”
According to research conducted by Digital Awarenss from the United Kingdom and the Directors' Association (HMC – Headmasters' and Headlegisnces' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged between 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they have secret accounts.
HMC's director, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers don't have access."
Elidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scotia Athletics Commission
Elidh Doyle was elected for the function of directors, without executive power, of the Scottish Committee of Athletics, during the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most beautiful ground and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from the vast experience that this has gained at the international level in the last decade.
"Eilid is pleased to respect the whole community of Scottish athletes, the British Sea, as well as all the world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits once they are included in the commission," said Beattie.
Doyle added: "I am glad that I could represent athletes and hope to have a real contribution and help in the way sports activities are carried out in Scotland."
The U.S. Nationality athletes, who won the 200- and 400-metre trials at the Games in Atlanta in 1996, along with the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent BBC commentator, remained invalid after he suffered a transient chemical attack.
It wrote on Twitter: “After a month, I suffered a brain attack.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether I will recover or whatever.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go back, and today I'm practicing agility!
Thank you for the comforting messages."
A advertisement to blood pumps comparing women with cows divides public opinion into the online environment
A blood pumping company has led to a division of public opinion online with a advertising that compares mothers who are dealing with the herding of cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that would want to be “the first silent and portable blood pump in the world”, Elvie’s consumer technology company launched an ironic announcement, inspired by a music video clip, to present the freedom that a new pump offers to mothers who are helping.
Four real moms dance in a full-fashioned fairy tale on a melody that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm sorry, but I don't have a code" and, "If you haven't noticed, these are not eggs, but my teeth."
The reference goes on to say: “Pupez, pumppoze, pupze on the baby, pumppoze, pumppeze, extract the milk from the girls.”
However, the claim, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video clip was held with mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of them saying it dropped out of the milk industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and born to produce milk, except that the children are stolen only a few days from birth," wrote a person.

Another person commented: “It’s understanding how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a blood pump for mothers who can protect their babies?"
Another added: "A very negative complaint."
Other people have appeared to claim the claim, a person claiming that there was a "silar" claim.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still shooting.
The pumping really made me feel like a vive.
The claim is a little bit of a mess, but I took it as an attack.
But the product is great," wrote a person.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun advertising about moms who use pumps (sometimes at work or in toilets) and who feel like "swifts".
It's not a advertising that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video clip, the group of women discovers that they have danced with discreet pumps introduced into the suite.
The concept that is based on the campaign is that many women who use blood pumps say they feel like pigs.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, does not have cancer or tumors, and is in a discreet manner suitable for adoption, offering women free movement, the possibility of holding their children in their arms and even going out to the city while they use the pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner, consultant and developer in Mother’s project, commented: “Pompa Elvie is a product that is so revolutionary that it deserves such a frightening and provocative launch.
Compared to the mothers who shed milk and milk cows, I wanted to highlight what it means to use a blood pump and the trials in this sense, presenting, in a funny and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that will give him the new pump.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump gets on the first page.
During the presentation of fashion creator Martha Jakubowski at the London Model Week, the mother of two children appeared on the floor while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred to hiding in a refugee camp at the border with Texas
The number of remaining migrant children increased, although the number of people who crossed the border each month remained relative to the same, mostly because of the difficult returns and policies introduced by the Trump administration caused the collection of children's placement procedures to sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear that they will endanger the country's seat if they are asked to take the children.
The risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult members of the family, must register their printers and that their data will be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the Vamal and Immigration Authority, announced in front of Congress that the agency had arrested ten persons who requested sponsoring the disabled minors.
Finally, the Agency confirmed that 70% of the arrestees had no previous sentences.
"About 80% of the sponsors or members of the sponsors' families live illegal in the country, and most of them are foreign offenders.
What it means is that we will continue to look for the respective individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing in the child's system, the authorities introduced new rules, in accordance with which the children must be present at the time of one month of detention, and not 60 days as provided for by the previous standard, in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Regulation.
Many will suffer for the case through a video call, and not personally in front of an immigration judge, to request the statute of legal residents.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more they can become indifferent or depressed, which can lead to violent or attempted eviction reactions, according to employees and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers have stated that these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is the possibility that signs indicate that a child has problems are not observed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to keep them well from friends could cause them trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria asks the US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria is in the war for eight years.
Moulalem, who is also the prime minister, said that foreign military forces are illegally located in a Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "the situation will be managed appropriately".
"This must be withdrawn immediately and without any condition," he said during the meeting.
Moulalem insisted on the fact that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 330,000 people died in 2011 and millions were displaced from their homes.
This further stated that Damascus will continue “this war sacred until we extend the terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories”.
In Syria there are about 2,000 military troops in the United States, who are particularly involved in training and counseling Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moulalem stated that there are favourable conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading Iranian fears", since refugees were determined to stay away.
It added: "I have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return."
"There are political influences in a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings on the fact that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recently concluded agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to prolong the last rebel group has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey agreement has contributed to avoiding a massive enlargement with the help of the Syrian forces, supported by the Russians, over the province where three million people live.
However, Moulalem highlighted the fact that the agreement has a clear deadline and expressed the hope that the military action will see the Jewish groups, including those on the Nusra border, which have links with the Al-Qaeda network and which will "be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations emissaries, hopes to meet soon in a first sitting of a new formal committee of government members and opposition to the drafting of a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the country for elections.
Moulalem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the activities of the Committee should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the present constitution" and issued a notice of interference.
Why won Trump's second mission
If we are to take this logic, Trump will be real in 2020, except where the disposal procedure or the scandals will end its presidential mandate earlier, which most of the free hearings expect to take place.
In this case, there would be no doubt "the most dramatic of a presidential mandate of all times!"
Until now, it seems that the audience is still interested in subject matter.
Since 2014, first-time hearings have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, for the first time, the Fox News TV post was followed, on average, by 2.4 million people, four years ago when it was 1.7 million, and the release "The Rachel Maddow Show" from MSNBC recorded an audience record with 3.5 million people who followed it in the series where important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the film-maker "Reservative President" of the ABC, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the capital building.
In Scowell, a comedy writer with a wide experience in the field and authorizing the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She reminds herself of a trip with the Boston taxi before the 2016 elections.
The victim told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "When it makes me laugh," Scowell said to me.
In chaos, fun is valued.
Of course, unless anything else is broadcast on TV, the action carried out in Washington could determine the future of the Roe Versus Wade case if immigrant families can be filled out and about the state of the global economy.
Change of position is a luxury that only privileged audiences can afford.
However, you are not only a informed citizen when you arrive at the sixth watch of the debate by a committee of experts in the way Bob Woodward uses "deep background" (confidentially) sources for his book, "Fear", about the skin jacket worth $15,000 of Paul Manafort" (a "opulent vesting object", according to The Washington Post) and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Stormy Daniels's "anatomous parts".
For example, I will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"A lot of what makes you feel like looking at a reality show and feeding you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and the founder of the "Asie of the Amanet", about the constant change in distribution and the daily moods caused by Trump (declaration of a professional American football league, the praise brought to Kim Jong-Un's address).
Don't let you lose an episode, 'cause you'll feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his home on the north coast of the island of Kauai, there were 27 degrees and it was the sun, and he sat inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He could not get out of front of the television, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was after meeting with the Senate's legal committee and had decided to decide the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember we made some emissions out of the community in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seems I was right."

Compulsory external financial resources for the closest media selections associated with the Chamber of Representatives
As a result of a realisation of electoral districts, which resulted in two holders of the mandate in an electoral course for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania enjoys complementary financial resources.
Thus, the new suburban of the Pittsburg district brought him to the course of the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won the special elections in another district from the past.
Lamb seeks against another executive mandate holder, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania, which is significantly above the 17th.
The electoral papers were reconfigured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, with the restrictions on the districts in favour of the republics.
The course of the 17th electoral district has launched a competition in the financing of campaigns between major party funding agencies, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign (NCRC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a long victory in the course of special elections, at the highest hearing, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade, the function was occupied by a republican, and President Donald Trump won this district with a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, democracy enjoys an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the penalization of the state of El Salvador due to its understanding with China, but then gave up.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a preliminary meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the management team of the Trump Organization.
The State Department officials decided to call the US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement early this month.
However, sanctions were taken only against the state of El Salvador, which received US assistance worth approximately $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country of Central America and the high rate of shock and crime.
As the internal meetings have recorded progress, North American and Central American officials have delivered a high-level conference, based on security and economic prosperity, in order to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
But by the half of September, officials from the administration had made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any examination of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned that Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, and would like to highlight the importance of the meeting by the administration, the diplomats declared.
And the three American ambassadors returned to their homes in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions only if they were kept anonymous.
Their relations were co-ordinated by an external analyst, who is close to the administration and who also spoke with the condition of the preservation of the anonymity.
Study of history
The next thing that could happen is the Special Adviser's report by Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to justice by President Trump, which now has strong public evidence.
It also seems that Mueller is leading his own research and on the investigation of the existence of an alliance between Trump and Russia's campaign with regard to the attack on the American elections.
In the event that Congress will change, Trump will face the appropriate responsibility within the body, even when he is preparing to appear before the Members and may possibly represent a legal form of his colleagues.
There are many situations that are possible and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "debt" is inevitable, valid, and for his omologists in Europe.
There are choices we have to make for all of us on one and the other of the Atlantic and who will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to give a coup against Hitler, only if the West was opposed and supported by the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
I failed and lost this opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical times, and the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face such critical times right now.
What do we do if Trump's gonna drop him on the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year it suggested the secret registration of the President and reflected on his incompatibility with the role of the President.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
"How will we answer if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in the face of the credible allegations of sexual aggression and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will bring it to bear on Trump?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long edge.
But I don't think we're gonna fail after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czech origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied me with the ambassadorial residence.
He survived, he emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Saturdays on the table with a vistic.
With such a imagination, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Joi, Rangers will be a gas team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian game, after the impressive Spanish match against the Villarreal team from the beginning of the month, will place it on a strong position to qualify from the Group G of the European League.
An accident at the knees did not allow middle-aged Graham Dorrans to play this season until 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers team can use this result in his advantage to achieve better performances.
"It was a good point for us, considering that Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old player.
"We started the game thinking we'd get a good result and we won a point.
I've probably been able to sign at the end, but, in total, I think the equation was a good result.
I think they've been better in the first time, and we've noticed better in the second.
Joy, it'll be a big night for Europe again.
At least we'll get three points, but it'll be a hard game, because they've had a good result in the last game played. However, with support from the supporters, we'll probably feel more motivated and have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a challenge, taking into account my accidents and the changes from the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; training goes, too, fine.
Let's hope we'll continue, we'll leave the last season and we'll have good results."
Women have sleep problems due to the economies of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the probe knew clearly how to be concerned, few people talked to family members about this.
About half of the people who participated in the study conducted by the nationwide company said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said they were talking to their children about this subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but does not start this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare a family to provide you with the care you need if you don’t meet your needs in time.
Work with the consultant and the family to discuss the location and manner in which you will receive care, as these choices could represent a significant factor for setting costs.
Involve the Financial Adviser: and the Financial Adviser can be of real help with regard to the payment of these costs.
Your long-term funding options may include a long-term insurance policy, a multi-life insurance policy, to help you cover these costs or to ensure your own well-being – to the extent that you have money.
Please refer to the legal documents: you come to face legal issues.
Get an authority on medical decisions, appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate with them.
Consider, too, the exercise of an expert on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will take the financial decisions in your name and make sure that you are aware of your facts, if you do not have the necessary capacity to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that a parent with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about her medicine and her allergies?
Please note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are dealing with it?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of his dogs?
Please draw up a plan for all these things."

Cuttlefish and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and is expected to increase the number of deaths.
As a result of the interruption of communications networks, the disaster authorities were unable to obtain information from the Donganga Regent, a region in the north of Palu, which is located close to the epicenter of the coast with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the destruction.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donghe, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the center of the island of Sulawese, which is located at the end of a August golf course, on the coast of the island of Sulawese, with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The holiday season was 40 years old when it was hit by tsunamis and tsunamis.
Donegal is a regency that extends on a coast with a surface of more than 300 km north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
Regenzia, an administrative region located in the province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture activities represent the central point of the province's economy from the centre of the island of Sulawesi, in particular the coastal region of Dongäa.
In addition, mining activities for the extraction of nickel are important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the coast of the Sulawesi island.
Palu and Donghea have been hit by tsunamis more and more over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongëra.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Dongha regency, causing the death of the new people.
Indonesia is located in the Circ of the Pacific, a region of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the customs and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a powerful tsunami on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of the island of Sumatra, declared a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: a series of strong droughts struck the west coast of the island of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-degree crater on Richter scale struck the south of the most popular Indonesian island, Java, starting a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6-degree summit near the town of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province, was located near Richter.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: a 7.5-degree crater on Richter's scale struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, along the coast of the island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with a height of up to 10 metres, which destroyed ten satire and killed about 300 people.
2016: a decline in intensity occurred in the Pidie Jaya Regengen in Aceh, causing pay and panic, because the people and people remembered the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami, which fought with a large number of deaths.
This time a tsunami didn't occur, but more than 100 people died because of abandoned buildings.
2018: More powerful tsunamis took place on the island of Lombok, causing the death of more than 500 people, most of the northern part of the island.
The fortress destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists remained temporarily locked under the walls.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate at the Vice-President's post, Sarah Palin, was arrested following a violent charge.
Palin, aged 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested under the suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence claim and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by the police in the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of this sex woman tried to call the police to claim crimes, she took her phone.
Palin is in police custody, at Mat-Su unit, waiting for the trial, and is held on the basis of a case-by-case, worth 500 dollars, according to KTUU.
This was presented on Saturday, where it was declared "100% innocent" when the debt was requested, according to the network.

In addition, charges of a category B offence were brought against them, which was sentenced to a day in prison and an amount of $2,000.

Federal prosecutor wants capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The New York federal prosecution wants the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare one that was no longer applied in the state for a federal offence in 1953.
It seems that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a truck purchased Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike track on the West Side highway from the Lower Manhattan, hunting platoons and cyclists on its trajectory in October.
In order to justify capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov deliberately killed the eight victims and deliberately caused serious body damage, according to the opinion on the request for capital punishment, from the Southern District of New York.
Both heads of prosecution may receive a capital sentence according to the document of the court.
In a few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 charges involving eight charges of crime in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the fact of "audio, cruel and deliberate".
“Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following individuals: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco”, according to the opinion.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last judge of a case of capital punishment in the South District of New York.
The priest, Khalid Barnes, was charged with killing two drug dealers, but later he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital penalty applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two women executed after being convicted of conspiracy on the commission of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wife was executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
He accused the investigators of being good at what he did, according to police reports.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt compelled to execute the attack after watching ISIS's video clips on his phone, according to the director.
Also, according to the police, he requested that ISIS be planted in the hospital room.
He was born innocent in the case of the 22 chiefs of charge.
David Patton, one of the defence officers who represented Saipov, said that they are obviously disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the capital penalty, instead of accepting a life imprisonment debtor, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the associated trauma for all the persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team asked the former prosecutors not to apply the capital penalty.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party claims that NIGEL FARAGE must be present in the context of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today that he would "mobilize the civilian army", during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
Ukip's former leader stated that politicians should "simply feel pressure" from the Eurosceptic, following a statement by a member of Parliament Theresei May who suggested that it should be held in front of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would “have gone” until now if Farage was a Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
However, the challenge that May faces in relation to extremely divided tables was raised by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the absence of the European Union organised in the city.
The first attempts from the perspective of its commitment plan, as well as the Chequers plan, to address the attacks by those who support the European Union, who want to remain in it, as well as by the European Union.
The Alliance stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of consequences, and will force the Eurosceptic and the Laburist Party to choose between its offer and "haos".
Good said in the event of the Pro-Brexit move "Leave Means Leave" in Solihul that he wants "the rejection of the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and that responsibility be attached to the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were his, we were no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of Wellingborough, added: "You will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan."
Referring to its opposition to the European Union, it said: "We have not fought in the world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
It is good to reject the proposals for the change of public opinion to the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British have discussed themselves and that they want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also in the demonstration and told the reporters: "I just want to say so: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
"The public is not in agreement with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party is not in agreement with him and our activists who are on the road and who support us, firstly, in the elections.
You give up on the Chequers plan and you start listening."
In a message visiting Theresa May, she added: "Ministers who maintain their role are those who respect their promises."
During the meeting, Nigel Farage stated that politicians should be put in a situation where they are going to "press the pressure" if they are going to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"We're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that "we're not going to let him do this."
In a message of enthusiastic gratitude, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civil army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and will not give up until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support the stay in the European Union have marched through Birmingham two hours ago in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised bans written “Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Laburist Party, has met with members of the Conservative Party and with security problems encountered in the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all the technology for Canada more, to digitise Vamal procedures, to free and unlimited trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a joke.
Brexit doesn't bring benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously to apply to the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously think of applying to the presidency after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the democratic senator of Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a spring meeting in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, seeks to be realized at the November elections against Geoffrey Diehl, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chaired by Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was in the center of speculation according to which she could win Trump in 2020.
The afternoon afternoon event in Holyoke was the meeting with the number 36 with citizens with voting rights using the primary format since Trump took over the presidential role.
A participant asked her if she was going to apply to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for "women to reach Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government, and this includes finding a woman in his face."
A suspect was arrested in the event of the death that caused Sims' death from the LSU team
The baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the event of death that caused the death of the LSU basketball player Wade Sims last Friday.
The baton Rouge police department announced Dyteon Simpson's arrest at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of the fire of Friday, asking for help to identify the man from the pictures.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus the next morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday for 247sports.
Wade tried to find his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and recognized that he was in possession of a gun, but also that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a young player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, being 10 times in the initial league in the last season and playing, in the middle, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 games recovery.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders will have an essential role to play.
Finding first position in class, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two hours and inviting Vettel to attack his coach.
Vettel was the first who stopped at the box and left Hamilton behind in the group code, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the box later and came from Vettel's back, but Hamilton managed to advance after some schemes that forced Ferrari's driver to leave the inside free after he made a double move to defend himself at the third floor.
Max Verstappen started the course on the back of the car and is located about seven at the end of the first trip, even on the day when he was 21 years old.
Then he found himself in the front for a large part of the course, looking at a quick end and trying to pass on Kimi Raikkonen and take the place four.
In the past, he stopped at the train with number 44, but he couldn't take the step in the last eight races, Raikkonen remaining in the four place.
"It was a hard day. Valtteri did an extraordinary job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me face it.
And the team did a great job to win victory in front of Ferrari and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A horrible body language
President Donald Trump ironed on Senator Diane Feinstein's Saturday afternoon, during a meeting on his instincts as it did not facilitate the "scourage" of Christine Blasey Ford's writer, who accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court of sexual aggression.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford's report before the Senate's Judicial Committee, saying that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "bad, immoral and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that would happen in the last days in the Senate, when you see hands, when you see people who are angry and bad and immoral and lying," he said.
"When you see that they've published the information and then I say they haven't done it.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Diane Feinstein if she made it easy for the document to "swift"?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..poftim?
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, I didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "passed" in September, but Feinstein denied that "scurry" was produced from her office.
"I didn't hide the accusations about Ford and I'm not the one that made it easy for her "to cut" her relationship," said Feinstein to the Commission, according to the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep my privacy and I did that exactly."
However, her refusal does not seem to be well spoken by the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the democracies use the charges to reach their own goals.
"I am determined to take power in any way possible.
Note the evil, immorality, do not care who is hurt and who must destroy to gain power and control," the president said, according to the Mediaite website.

An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
Saturday, the prosecution closed the debt with regard to the suspension of the trial for a man charged that he had killed a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst in the Department of Justice of the United States, has been reporting for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used his mobile phone records to lead Quinton Tellis's actions, at the age of 29, as well as his victims, Jessica Chambers, at the age of 19, on the night that he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed, this being in contradiction with his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data came to light that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said it was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the testimony box and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "did lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another coincidence was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
The mobile phone records indicate that they were known for a week.
Rowlett stated that, shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis broke down the text messages, calls and contact data of Chambers on his phone.
"He threw her out of his life," said Hale.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final Sunday debt.
The judge stated that he would predict that the jury would decide at the end of that day.

Another color person?!
A brother in New York court gives a couple of sentences for having given her after she received a "rasist" message.
A brother in New York judges a couple to grant a divorce for discriminatory reasons after he received a text message from his mother, claiming that he was “one more person of color”.
The couple denied that they were grown up, claiming that she had given it in court for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed gratitude when she found out that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was coloring when she was presenting her first day of work in 2016.
"WUUUUUUUO! INCE A PERSOANCE OF CULOARE," he wrote to his wife, Plasco-Flaxman, in a text message.
However, instead of sending her husband away, she sent Maurice twice.
After considering the case, feeling betrayed, Plasco-Flaxman granted Maurice, saying that the grandfather, who is affro-American, did not meet his obligations appropriately and that he was expected to receive a flag of the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for work day and sent home with Uber.
Now, she gives in court the couple to agree to grant and requests the amount of $350 per day for six months, the period in which she had to live with it and carry out her business, despite the fact that this was done without a closed contract.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she said on Friday for the Post newspaper, adding, "I know it's a word of discrimination."
The couple denied the statements about the fact that they were grown, saying it was a normal thing to give Maurice, because they were afraid I could no longer trust her after they judgified her.
"My wife sent him a wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, their husband, for the Post newspaper.
“Did you leave your children in the hands of a person whom you had sinned, even if they were guilty?
The new-born child?
Let's be serious."
In view of the "extortion" process, Plasco stated that his wife will be born in two months and that she is in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to fight a person in such circumstances?
It's not like that," added the bank investor.
While the process is under way, the public opinion has accused the couple of socializing networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they have demonstrated.
Paddington's story editors were afraid that readers would not be able to identify with a race that speaks, according to a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the paper was accepted, said the following things about writing: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time, before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a terrible success."
This further stated that his father, who was a cameraman for BBC before being inspired by a playbook to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "long-lasting" after he died last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family”, she added that her father had a discrepancy about the success she enjoyed later.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to sing," she said.
"We, because Paddington was so real for him, was like a child who had a success: you're proud of him, though it's not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, it was always used to accord Paddington's honor."
My daughter was dead, and I had to get her back on the phone.
On the landing, her daughter was transported quickly to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad calls often to tell me it's very serious and doesn't think it's going to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me he's going to die in the next two minutes and that I have to get away from her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines administered by medicines to keep her heart pumping began to decrease and get out of her body.
Slowly died, and the organs began to no longer function.
I had to stay there and wait, aware of everything that was happening.
I couldn't hear or dress because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
In the past, Ednan-Laperouse, in pain after his daughter's death, got into the plane, along with other passengers, who didn't know what happened.
"No one knew," she said.
"I held my head down and the tears didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a complex feeling of sympathy to Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."

Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney and says his son is going to be a promising cook with a mollusc smile.
"Everyone appreciates the smile.
They always said his smile changed your mood."
However, he quit his job before he died because he arrived at a very unpleasant moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the same time, found his brother after losing his life.
Davis said, "I'm still thinking you're going to have a domino effect."
It created messages “to convey to people that I can call on someone or that I can talk to someone, even a friend.
Get out of here, you have to talk to somebody."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old life partner, at least from his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he didn't feel well or he's depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a desperate state in the day of Christmas, when the children did their presents and he didn't even look at them."
She said that his death was a tremendous blow for them, but she had to overcome it: “He caused great pain within the family.
We're ruined.
But we have to go further and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in play, as a result of the start of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked – an investigation over a limited period of time and a reduced enlargement – we could have a small unit," said Jeff Flake Saturday, adding that the commission is on the way to "disintegrate", on the ground of a party block.
Why don't they want Kavanaugh and his supporters to do a FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the whole of the time factor.
There are only five weeks until the 6 November elections - if, as it is supposed, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one who wants to win the election for the highest court in the country will be significantly weaker.
George W. Bush gave all his calls to senators, to convince him to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through which he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to make the difference in case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, a South Korean parliamentarian said.
Park Byeong-seug, reading data from South Korea's Ministry of Unity, stated that the last year had fled about 1.127 people from the country, compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were border controls more severe between North Korea and China and the higher rates understood by those who carry illegal persons across the border.
The piano didn't make any public comment.
One vast majority of the refugees in the north are eventually offered to South Korean citizens.
The Seoul officials declare that more than 30,000 North Koreans have passed the illegal border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
The largest escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the protected powerful demilitarized zone (DMZ) of the two parts of Korea.
China considers illegal migrants more likely to flee than refugees and often repatriate them strongly.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still, in practice, in the war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met at Phenian for some of the discussions that they had been right about the negotiations on denuclearization.
This took place after the historic meeting between American Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong from Singapore, when they agreed, in general, to collaborate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But, Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not have confidence in our national security and, in such situations, we will never be the first to defend ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as being "steric", saying it is impossible to serve the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the Democratic Minority in the Chamber of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court as “steric” and said that his temperature is inadequate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made Saturday's comments during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of the fact that if there was a woman in this situation, it would have been declared "extremely," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal commission, which had taken place.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that she would have been sexually abused by Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes nearly stopped and lost his voice because of emotions, while he discussed his family and school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the Commission, calling charges against him "a mass and coordinated murder", organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said it is reasonable that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court, because it showed that he had a party character against the Democrats.
"I believe it is decalibrated by the respective declarations and by the way it attacked the Clinton family and democracy," she said.
Pelosi was due to the subject when he was asked if he would try to stop Kavanaugh if it would be confirmed and if the democracies would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say so: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which it is now," Pelosi said.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Appeal Court in the Columbia District.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the affordable care law or the Roe Versus Wade case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question whether he would comply with certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the right time for a woman, a partner, to go to the court and wait for us to say, "Wow! What wonderful!" said Pelosi.
And the women have to hand it over.
It's a justified diaphragm, it's months and years of accumulated anger and can't speak without crying out.
"We cry when we're excited," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, doesn't it?"
She continued: “I received a significant help from a woman who has an executive function, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she was upset and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
I've seen a great thing."
Lacrimes are permitted to exorcise anger, partly because they are fundamentally wrong.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first workplaces, in a dominated office of men, where I began to cry because of an inexplicable rage, is that I was beaten by a older woman, a fresh-faced director who always felt a bit of fear, and went home to the rocks.
"I don't have to see you crying ever," she said.
"I don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad that they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat at Congress in Colorado State, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was found to have an extra-conjugal relationship on a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from the course, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought that there was no reason why she would not even apply to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very good decision," she said laughing, 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the course, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "Alba as the Zjada and the seven little ones."
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fund-raising and she swore she wouldn't get into the race if she couldn't save $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
He found out that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, only gave him $250.
"Where do they think I get reductions?" she asked.
During the speech he announced that he would not launch a company officially, he was so affected by emotions – as a result of recognition for the people who supported him, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and to see voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – he lost his voice because of emotions.
"You said I had a nervous crisis," Schroeder recalls about the press's reactions to her.
"You'd say one of my sponsors is Kleenex."
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my funeral stone.
"The plan?"
How can it be beneficial for Beijing's trade war between the United States and China?
The greetings that announced the beginning of the US-China trade war have been overwhelming and, although it seems to be longer until the end of it, the certs between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar, steel and aluminium panes.
The most important scaling took place this week with new tax, which affected products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds of sterline), which actually applied to half of all the goods from China coming to the United States territory.
Beijing has resolved every time, the most recent imposing a rate of between 5 and 10% for US products worth $60 billion.
China warned that it would respond to every hit by the United States and is unlikely that the second world economy would take a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must be in agreement with its demands, but openly surrendering to the United States would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, Chinese President.
However, experts say that, if Beijing plays well, US pressures on trade war could support China in a positive way over the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than what has been foretold so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security (Centre for New American Security), a group of experts.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasts for seven years.
During his speech in the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moulalem stated that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," she said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the devastated areas of terrorists so that things go back to normal.
The existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country in which they were required to leave it because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that they have seen with their lives and lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulam stated that the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, it stressed that conditional assistance and assistance from countries sponsored by the insurgent will not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 after winning the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the Paris city, France.
The United States has now recorded the sixth consecutive victory in Europe and has not won Ryder cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to the first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn received 14,5 points, necessary to win the United States.
American old Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournaments, sent the minge from the initial battle into the water at the 3rd floor of the 16th floor by sending Francesco Molinari's game.
The Italian golf player Molinari had an incredible performance in all reviews, becoming one of the four players with a 5-0-0 result since the current tournament format, from 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost the game 5 and 4 in front of the player at the last place in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The first player in the world class, Dustin Johnson, lost his 2 and 1 games in front of Ian Poulter from England, which is probably his last game from Ryder cup.
A veteran of Ryder's cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player of Europe with most winners, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t sleep.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win again.
It's a team job and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia, excitedly after European victory.
This gives him his cousin John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at the games 2 and 1, to the individual, Sunday game.
"I'm very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to follow the games when I was a child," says Rahm, aged 23.
Woods lost all the four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder cup.
A strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being just over Jack Nicklaus.
Throughout the weekend, the American team launched a real effort on the golf field, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played an extraordinary game throughout the tournament.
The captain of the American team, Jim Furyk, said after a devastating performance of his team: "I'm proud of them, they've even fought.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've been fighting for a long time.
Just a hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with PGA of America and our Cupa Ryder Committee and we'll go further.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to agree to respect them.
They played better than us."
News about the Great Red: the concentrations decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
