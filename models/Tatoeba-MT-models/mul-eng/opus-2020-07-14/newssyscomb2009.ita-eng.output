The triumph of the right people in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived inconsistencies of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right populist parties have brought, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections of Domenica in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously vaccinating, has suddenly lost particularly strong.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Vice-President of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national policy.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the socio-democratic (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the 2006 elections, but 5.5%.
Worse still, it went to ÖVP, which loses by 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian history of the Second War, and in particular the literal catastrophic result of the peoples, who have caused early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the peoples had a great advantage in the preferences before SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them because they made the government worse.
In the first reactions to the results there have been speculations on the possible discharges of the president of the party, Vice-President Wilhelm Monterer.
The observers believe that Monday may already occur during the extraordinary call of the party's leadership.
This evolution may have to facilitate the path to the most likely way out of the electoral result, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both right-to-right and liberal populist parties (FPÖ) the BZÖ received 18% in advance and the BZÖ 11% of votes - but socio-democratic groups at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999 when the populace was agreed with the peoples to the collective government (then the FPÖ was still united, separated by BZÖ in 2005) which had been a cause of sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution clearly plays Haider, who has already said it is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national policy.
In Parliament, it has also succeeded in entering the Greens Party, but it has fallen slightly, falling between the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be refreshing
If it failed to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of Scarbes in India, the Czech Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, according to the Czech Foreign Minister, would have been a real relief of the Czech-India relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after the meeting today with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it hadn't been resolved, then it would have been a relief," he said after the meeting that had taken place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive power can hardly enter legal cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, which has been charged and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with that local in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kuchera sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher station.
Then you can ask for release on custody and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner was expressed the same way during the negotiations.
"Command the appeal to the Supreme Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can enter into proceedings is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support" has been supported by the Indian Minister.
At the same time he said that a support of the kind is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have existed for many years with India.
The Indians agree," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, before his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic is of great importance to the problem of blind entomologists.
"We really think it is a serious mistake to dismiss and accuse these hidden scientists," he said.
The Minister refused to answer the question if he had obtained the promise of taking up the matter from the Indian side.
"I've received relatively many promises," he just noticed.
A Czech judge in the Battle for the Marines
It is near the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are designed.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together to the sea-funded ship.
The area is at the same time as the same continent, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 UN Division workers on ocean issues and maritime rights.
His head, the Czech director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and every one adds something.
I have the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The Marine Fund is still hiding a little known world of natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal mineral and other mineral materials, but also living organisms unknown until now that carry the key to the discovery of the medicine against cancer.
The largest base of the teraferma
The coastal states have begun to take an interest in the Southern Territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they benefit from laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially true of the area of the so-called Continental Platform, which is often extended to several hundred miles from the coast of the state concerned.
This is based on the Convention's exclusive right to all the resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words for a continental platform, that part of the seabed and its subsoil is meant to be a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often more than 200 thousand nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the dimensions of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical and scientific documentation based on many customs investigations and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
"One of our tasks is to seek legal and technical assistance from the Commission.
The Commission has so far addressed 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three named have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
Australia's recent success that has greatly expanded its marine properties has registered a global eco.
But the New Zealand has also gained - the surface of the marine fund, which has been assigned to it by the Commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers, so it is six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested in the search for millions of dollars.
The profit, which will produce them in the future from the marine foundations, as they promise, will be invaluable.
Other States will submit their requests gradually.
They can do so for ten years since the "Mongo Bay Convention" was ratified.
Where the Continental Platform ends, the zone of the ocean fund that the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity."
No one's had an exclusive position right now.
The right to extradition in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Fund is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka exaggerating, "in the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their regime is contractually established."
The Secrets of the Pacific
A part of the Marine Fund is also part of the Czech Republic today.
If it sprats it with other states of the former Soviet block in the field of the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
This was acquired in 1991 under the Convention, as well as by investors from a few other states, the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is fragmented, it's a nearly replication of Tatry's subtomarine.
"It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich collection of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, copper and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonian Division Rober Sandev brought with him a repertoire to show him.
It looks like a little patata or with some fantasy, a legend scheme, like in the legend of the resurrection of the Golem.
German special units were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages – experts arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More detailed information is available on the conditions of the release of the 11 hidden European hostages.
The Ministry of Defence and the Interior participated in the rescue operation.
In addition to the military specialists, the GSG9 units were present, the federal aviation police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As reported by the spokesman of the ministers on Monday night, the German units did not intervene because the sequencors, in view of the danger of a force intervention, released the arrests by fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join them as direct assistance on the spot.
"We didn't come here for luck," says a spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior.
A group of tourists: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian accompanying agents arrived on September 19th in southern Egypt.
After the raid in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Cid.
The identity of the raptors until the end is kept secret as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
Freedoms in time arrived in Cairo in good condition.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release were not explained.
There was no information in Berlin until they were returned to Germany.
According to the "Build" newspaper, 5 vacations and special units should fly with an Airbus from the military aircraft and arrive on Tuesday in Germany.
The American representative room rejects the rescue package.
The first room of the American Congress has just failed the 700 billion-dollar rescue package for financial markets.
Dow Jones is down.
With 206 votes to 227, the US representative home rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the US President's calls for George W. Bush and the first-class politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets had to be resolved.
In a dramatic action, the supporters tried desperately to persuade the critics of the heavy package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the treaties, urged the members of the consensus, even though the plan was improvised.
8. It is difficult to recognize that something has not yet arrived.
While the shower Jones was running, more than 6 percent or 600 points were broken.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the State rescue package could have failed.
It took place before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of the failure, to roll again.
Experts now expect other serious disturbances on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it must benefit both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Promotors record figures in increasing bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the turnover of travel bookings for the next months compared to the previous year has been increased clearly - for the winter season of more than 30%.
Despite the weak sights of conjugation, the desire to travel from Germans is at a left-wing investigation.
On bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded an additional 31 % factor compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German association for the DRW tourism in Berlin learned on Monday .
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute, there are increased booking rates even for the autumn months.
Therefore, the absence of travel agencies in October compared with 2007 would be estimated at about 11%, the DRW reported.
Presumably for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and sets statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the poor rate of the dollar, requested in particular would be travel in the United States, he referred to the VAT.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about one third.
In addition, there would be travel facilities specifically requested in the Germans Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as in Germany.
In particular, travel including all of them have a high rate, explained the president of the DRW Klaus Laepple.
Given the increasing costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be better calculated for customers than for an individually organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for bookings made with strong advance or offers, including Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, as compared to the year before, there would have been a return to the invoice - even if according to further study the number of Germans who made a trip, compared to the previous year, was successful.
My first time at October
Hits of Ballermann, beer from a litre and vip in Dirndln fluffati.
A show on Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, moderate TV and wears a Dirndl made of size.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, greets us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photographs are already being launched against us and take photos until the memory of the photography machines is filled – very lusinghier, and this is my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how our friends do it.
The Dirndl from two money seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist of Wiesn and who actually lives in the north of the white salsifier, the sense of well-being in the costume/life so far remains within limits.
And yet once he came to Theresienweise, there's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or the leather pants; no one looks uncomfortable or uncomfortable – everything perfectly normal.
Only the grembule of my Dirndl collects strange sights at the banana stand at the chocolate.
A monazen tells me that I would have thrown the grembule in a wrong way: "On the left you are free, on the centre you're green, on the right you're busy, behind you."
Suddenly, I'm going to get my head back to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make smaller than flitt subtles and wear top caps of field, on which "To drink to get dressed!" and will be the dime black against an invited person.
The boy with exhilarating incarnations is called Bob, from England, and he is also visiting the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He found it "gorgeous" with a stranded "oooooo".
This tells me, after she was released from her beer bottle from a litre used to drink.
I own one of these guitars, of which everyone thinks it's a pattumy.
Bob insumma is one of these family "Wildbieesler".
Others do not have the chance to break free from alcohol in this way.
On the 8th of the evening they walk in white on the beach of the festival, which are to be occupied by the poor bees.
The nurses are always in white – always 4 times they carry a covered bar of tent in tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: it's empty, it's full.
Whoever falls under the telone in this cup of alcohol in the blood, you can't see.
"It's the day, where goarnimmer Packn," I hear one of the nurses and escape in the baronda.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospitals after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carol Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved on Wednesday afternoon on Shenfield Road in town.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died shortly afterward.
After the incident a 51-year-old man was arrested with the accusation of dissatisfied leadership.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter the Turkish interior.
On the east side of the Bosfor, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this fall imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-nascimental style.
This is at least what tourist guides tell you.
The building is in a qualifier between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its angles looking at the world like some German provincial towns.
The stone's broken.
The whole building is slowly falling.
But once in the office ticket from the ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most in the West.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German Consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to achieve its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions of Germany fell during the first world war.
His railways will be attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the freezing borders of the Cold War, is past.
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a ammunition train was designed to destroy its developed roof.
Turkish sources say it was a savage.
Since then it has slowly disappeared, widely overcome by history.
But today, this railway gap for Anatolia and all the east points serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the ever larger diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the ACP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the ice-cream borders of the Cold War, is past.
Now there's a new commitment policy.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and with the European Union and the United States, of course.
In order to appreciate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I was on the train bed for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main experts in the AKP's foreign policy, Turkish MEP Suat Kinniklioglu.
The following morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a foot-and-mouth race along the tracks that produced the chains from the ancient world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, they arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to return the shoulder to its former Ottoman.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents a exemplary move in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, most notablely in Washington.
A taxi brings me to the general district of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built at hoc - in a developmental subjugation, surrounded by commercial centres of construction and landscapes of power, where managers in full business - both men and women - meet to make contracts early in the morning.
Suat Kinniklioglu could be a policy of the right-hand side of almost every other political party in Europe.
I'm sure there's a Blackberry too.
"The purpose of the foreign political party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The cold war was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey was cut out of its backyard.
Today we must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But certainly at a certain point, "I ask, will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "he doesn't want to face that choice."
It then underlines a point that almost all those with whom I have spoken here have quoted in memory: the links not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are beneficial to Europe and the United States as much as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe can metaphorically cross those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha Station, after another night in white, I think of these two German gentlemans Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had seen this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that the medium-oriental ambitions of Europe can now be, in large part, in the hands of Turkey.
And while I look forward to the terminal for the tragedy that brings me back through the Bosfors, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt about which continent should advance on this fascinating country.
Vite reminded: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as the music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11th) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his city music scheme, the following year he founded his wonderful young heart, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21/ under the 21s, but when Proteus sang his final song in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up on the crown.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-movable) represented the good will of the heart and the ability to deal with everything that music presented to do, whether marriage or the Messiah, without association or with the entire orchestra.
The variety of music produced by such a young core was often impressive, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often I told Tod to "let it be the music to speak for themselves."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything there, in music.
That's why he sings!"
His technique in the use of the jacket was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever was the music standard, it always made it even higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a leader of the orchestra, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades that led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more, I have looked at more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been in agreement with one of them - and often inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated the Orchestra leaders who, in his words, simply "wave around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurology by William Woodruff (September 25th) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a career in science, one in letter and one PhD".
This results from the note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a PhDsis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff wants to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino to the Faculty of Philology
"Commanding José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and life", because his photographs in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength that they transmit, while treating protagonists with particular respect.
A show that sends a lot of feelings.
Resino is able to capture magical moments."
Assault by the Honda superseded
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great housing, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
At all, a refined mechanism will be added, which will increase the comfort of the guide and allow fuel to be saved.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz has a very similar line to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanics.
However, it is important to note that this new Jazz comes six years after its entry into the first generation market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a single phenomenon in fact of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and even during this period of 2008.
Even in Japan almost one million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow you to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, the estimates are about 100,000 cars for 2009, suggesting a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, the responsible for the Spanish branch are expected to sell around 2,000 Jazz units in the arc of a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz itself will allow Honda to reduce sales to a great extent in Spain.
In fact, the company’s responsibilities are expected to reach a total of 22,000 sales units by the end of the year, i.e. 4000 in less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, Honda trusts the arrival of another model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which Japanese society hopes to sell about 200,000 units per year worldwide.
For markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of the sales of Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continental and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company presentation in January in Valencia.
Unlike the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimetres in excess), the width is 1.69 metres (two centimetres in excess) and the distance is 2.50 metres, with an increase of five centimetres.
The height, however, remains unchanged at 1.52 metres.
Along with the size increase, it also expands the living interior.
This advantage comes from the introduction of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank into central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage – equipped with a double base - salt of 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It is noted that these are the measures of engine version 1.4, and that the capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear leds or the possibility to mount the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions are opened with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with petrol engine of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanisms include VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, optimise the mechanism and at the same time maintains the engine's pair in all its stages.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to use a power of 90 cm to 6,000 gri with a maximum of 114 Nm. to 4.900 gri.
The proposal – which reached 78 horses in the previous Jazz – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
With regard to the previous motion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now available in 100.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses achieve a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The "pe car" to avoid collision
In the context of the development of the technologies for preventing accidents, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, and in particular by the Api.
Japanese society has created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of wings to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collusion prevention technologies.
The engineers from the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, the BR23C constitutes an extension of the Security Survey of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer's car.
During the flight, each cap creates its own oval-form personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the eyes of the eagles, able to see in all directions with a angle of more than 300 degrees, which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To gain this visual functionality, engineers have put in place what they have defined a location laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately allows to prevent collision.
"When a obstacle arises, the small robot imitates the movements of an apple and immediately changes direction by turning on the right angle wheels or larger to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the manoeuvre is entirely essential.
"If it wasn't, the robot would not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer head of this project.
Unlike an apple, the robot cannot turn to the top or to the bottom, and not even to the diagonal; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can rotate its roots and not using infinite directions and methods like the apples do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to draw up the information every few seconds, and to act from these data.
It does not require the memory of information or the intuition logic of previous manoeuvres, so it can work without interruptions and with only a couple of dozen KB memory.
This may be surprising, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, and not even mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the internal prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan expects will be of series in cars within ten years.
The robot uses batteries to litio polymers, which are lighter and more durable compared to the typology with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to the destination by avoiding the obstacles in the road.
Step before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having many capitals to intervene, is not quite free of engineering.
In front of the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from engaged with double-sustained bank space, they have created a fun and educational game for users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of Trusted Victims"... or problems.
The roof looks like this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to drive you to think no one, but two or three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do so, which is probably the primary objective.
Of course the information the game provides is useful, but it's not very detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for the public.
What happens when the game is complete?
Well, compare a sound room inside the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share equal to 21% of the company's participation, news came after a net breach of its shares in Borsa.
A week after the adoption of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MMFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shareholders at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of three billion.
The price established is less than 19% at the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MMFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of 31.25 dollars, ensuring a 10% yield.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be based on an average price of 29 dollars, i.e. a percentage lower than its current rate of 28%.
By 1700, Morgan Stanley, however, was out of 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," John Mack, director-general of the American group, explained.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to differentiate his actions by doing it, however, under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MMFG also confirms how the current financial crisis calls for Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent approach to the matter in advance.
The procedures set out on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had just announced the sale of 20% of its shares in the Japanese collusion for a total of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought our share of participation would be exclusively made up of ordinary actions.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect us."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MMFG will receive the securities Morgan Stanley at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the operation would be converted into at least 20% of the equity on a dilute basis".
The agreement provides that MMFG may be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a period of more than 50%, the latter have been exchanged under the fixed conversion price, i.e. around 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by the MMFG would allow them to collect investment opportunities, to strengthen their budget and to increase their liquidity.
One member of the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MuFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore set a Solvency coefficient of Tier One at around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have "cleanly" attached his budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have tested the group, which has seen a decrease in the value of its actions, while the cost of insurance against risks has immediately been borne.
The cost of flying on Monday, however, remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, another superstate among Wall Street's big investment banks after the break of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the discovery of Merrill Lynch, announced that he had lost 15 billion dollars, partly at the Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Founding the Republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the last to vote on the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission from the time that 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, based on an 80% vote.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the votes should be taken, more than one.
On Sunday, two investigations conducted at the end of the electoral season and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a devastating victory of "yes", which occurred between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his construction project on Sunday and Monday.
The "Constitution has triumphed with glory," he assured, he congratulated himself with the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales were happy with Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The survey, which took place in all peace according to the electoral observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 points to strengthen the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution devotes the power of the state to the economy, while maintaining the "planification of development" of a country that lives mainly from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
The project, chosen by Korea in 2006, also gives greater power to the Head of State, who may be elected for two consecutive mandates of four years, will have the opportunity to leave the assembly.
Correa has already announced the intention to make use of this amendment and to renew its application for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the freedom of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty threshold.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
I 19 obstacles released in Ciad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the raptors of the only tourists and their eight escorts ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The only European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanied prisoners in the desert for ten days were reported on Monday afternoon, healthy and healthy, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Ciad by an Egyptian command.
Apparently, the hostages arrived at the base of Almaza, near the international airport of Cairo, about 15 and 30, on a special plane.
On the side of a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to deliver any interviews to the press, the Maadi hospital, a residential perimeter of Cairo, to be subject to analysis.
"Good health" has not been paid for any "the sequetritors", said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the landing track.
On September 19, during a 4x4 safari on the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages was beaten by a cover to another of 35 unknown sequectors.
The group was formed by 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptian leaders: two guides, four authors, a border guard and the director of Egypt, the organizational agency of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer claimed that 30 members of the special forces, on two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, shortly before the dawn.
"There have been shots, half of the sequencors have been killed, while the others have been fled," said the officer who asked to keep the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian orders.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of the secret agents and the Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result, it has been thanks to the professionality and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding more details.
He also stopped paying a ransom.
On the day before, the Sudanese Patúlio army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which was found by the sequencors and had killed six, including the knight's chadian leader, and had two captured.
According to the army, the sequencors would be linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the movement for the liberation of the Sudan (SLA_U), a statement immediately rejected by the latter.
Letter - The silent majority of culture
On the first page, a debate on the financing of culture focuses on the current electoral campaign.
That's so much better.
But part of our cultural life is always in the shadow.
Who will claim the measures granted to small museums, archives, archaeological caves or national historical sites that make the fame?
What policy will be the flag of the federal government that is crossing the monumental monuments and buildings?
What in Quebec, like in Canada, do we not have the true and own laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government goes to three and a half million euros for the only restoration of the Chinese castle, in the valley of Loira?
At our American neighbours, it is the Constitution to say that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this is a common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies in Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers are who are grouped into 211 companies for the protection of historical, genetic, archives and heritage goods, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are themselves who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
The Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis Bank
Benelux's states help through partial nationalisation by the Belgian and Dutch bank Fortis, which is in particular difficult for Europe for the US credit market crisis: the three countries will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest even in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the maximum level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been discussed for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken on this issue may constitute a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night all and three states will lose almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will sell almost certainly part of its interests, including first of all all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis began with a vertical circle, and a number of signs of the institution's crisis were then presented in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow them to fail.
The shares of the bank on Friday are almost 12%, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has been reduced by more than two thirds.
In view of the current shares' prices, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the bank's managers, this value is not real.
The company's summit led to the collapse of the Fortis shares in the uncertainty of the foreign market due to the acceptance of the US plan of $700 billion.
On Monday the title slowly got out.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new delegate to the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers, but no one has so far been presented with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors should not fear losing money.
Among the customers of the bank, the panic was not spread, the branches were not seized.
In Hungary the Fortis owns the autonomous branches and has also acquired licenses.
The wolf in the pool
In America, insurance policy providers, based on data on the purchase of medicinal products from people, often refuse to provide for an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy programme according to which the use of prescription data depends on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like trusting the bullet to the floor" - writes Washington Post by quoting Richard Dick the author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
Insurance companies shall subsidize the insurance fee and the issuing figure in the case of leftovers to the relevant customer’s health status and if they are too high, they shall not provide for insurance.
Some time ago the customer had to take a medical visit, and the contract was established only after the examination was completed.
Dick 10 years ago launched a much more economic procedure: on the basis of the customer's identification code, you can easily have information from the medicines you have purchased in the last year and in the middle of the year and from this program, which diseases are suffering and in which health conditions are found.
A. e. if you buy regularly large amounts of cholesterol reductions, this means that the level of fat in the blood is in practice immeasurably high and is classified in the higher risk category.
There are several versions of the programme in trade, some also determine the risk multiplier, so in addition to carding work, there are few difficulties.
Among the contradictions are that some medicines are more useful for more purposes, e.g. some ingredients are usable against ecmyrania or heat pumps, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the point of view of insurance - commercial, is worth the risk increase factor, the first two nos.
For the request and processing of data, companies have been formed in part and these, before receiving the necessary information from the medicines, require the patient’s approval.
Now the authorities are obliged to do so even if they have not had much to do with ignorance.
Some diets also develop the results of laboratory tests and connect them to medical data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more teeth have access to data and simultaneously control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
Before the Congress, there is a legislative proposal which gives the authorities the competence to control the companies specialized in the service of data.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: this is why he has developed a program that connects the rest of the data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned may not so much reject the approval because the insurance undertakings otherwise do not provide for the contract.
So at the end of the gallins are entrusted to the clearing of the volupe.
Global Marsiglie Menu
European Union and India doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that are trading in particular, the order of the ninth day of the summit has also been dominated by this theme, in addition to all other global problems.
Today, there will be a French-India summit that will focus on nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more votes should be taken in international affairs, but the Member States are not yet able to decide whether to support or not New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue at the summit held yesterday in Marsglia.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as vice president of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, High Representative of the Foreigners, received the first Indian Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in 5 years, namely an increase of up to 100 billion euros, trade.
In view of the fact that the trade in goods has come from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not a very ambitious tranche.
As a result, they have signed the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements on a legal basis, so air traffic can also take the way in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth place between the EU's partners.
The summit has devoted its attention to global events.
In the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in terrorism, this last condemned in all its forms by both parties, and called for a United Nations conference to be convened.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Round commercial, even though both parties had a role to play in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that the energy and climate programme will continue to decline by at least 20% by 2020 emissions of harmful substances.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that it would require a global agreement on the climate conference scheduled for the next year and to reduce the production of greenhouse gas by 50% by 2050.
They also wanted to limit the increase in the prices of food products and supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The first Indian minister will today go to the French capital where a bilateral meeting will prepare to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that in order to build the Indian nuclear reactors, the French customers received a trade of EUR 20 billion.
According to our printing agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Francoforte more than three hundred Italian editors
Strong presence of Italian editors at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international appointment for the exchange of rights.
The International Fair of the Frankfurt Book awaits more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy 171,790 square metres of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles in the exhibition and with Turkey as guests of honour.
It will be the Under-Secretary to the Ministry for the Beni and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Padiglio: Italy will be present institutionally with an Italian Point - 264 square metres of exposed space.
The meeting will follow with the press at the Room Structure in Buchmesse’s 5.0 floor: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and prospects on the state of the edition in Italy.
According to the data it gradually decreases the weight of foreign authors' books on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and boys.
I found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire disappeared a year ago
The relic of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying in the wilderness of Nevada.
The wheels were reached on an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammoth Lakes, to the border between California and Nevada.
In the air, however, there were no other human beings.
The sheriff of the Madeira County, John Anderson, escaped the doubts that still remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is exactly what Steve Fossett was looking for on the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that there were no human remains in the airport or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63, was killed in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) informed that a team of inquisitors was sent a few hours after the relic was announced, which then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was released on 3 September 2007, when Fossett departed from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were returned by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents with the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash in cash and a field.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, the first man was turned to complete the world round on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of flight in solitary confinement.
Three years later he had the world's circle in the air and without a ladder.
Among his many memories, he also flew to 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a pair.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schematics with original design and well defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
This is, in a sense, Glk the last born among the "compatises" offers of the star house with whom Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of news in this sector.
For its content outside the traditional cannons, it will be unexpected and unconventional even the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showroom on the next 17 October.
Thus the advertising battage that will accompany the start of the new vehicle will also launch an inked communication mode through an avviventist campaign of 3D offices, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-affsions, described in three different phases, which will dominate the centralist way of the Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in a stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso How will it be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image will have the impression that the car is out of the show.
Next, through the use of innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be lit at different times in all its details, so it will be repeated in a single image.
Certainly Mercedes with this publication is trying to introduce something new in the steroidal field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed in this formula to shock the interest of the future buyers?
Here are the Italian hooligans
From the Triveno, they're at risk of the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls from which all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Utras Italia" group that has been following the Assyrian National for years and which, in truth, has never created too many problems.
He's never been compared to the opponent typhoes.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
And promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These in Sofia have been added to groups (small units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
Three-coloured banners with the cities of origin of the military: Saturday evening they were taken to be not identified.
They're inspired by the English typhoes.
In Bulgaria they found a true Nazi typhosy, that of Levski.
Figc had 144 Italian typhoes available for the game: all nominees, so easily controlled.
And the Viminale actually controlled them all: among those parties for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who was infected by attending a stadium.
At four blue typhoes, which had previously been hit by the stage, the ticket was rejected and the transfer stopped.
Now the Viminale expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the typhoes who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the dispute.
An international Daspo that prevents us from attending not only Italian stations but throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, of course, won't put any feet in a stage.
For luck.
But now there's fear-emulation: that's what these little more than 50, if others add.
"We must shoot this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they support the Viminale.
So, "good open eyes especially in view of the game of the National Wednesday in Lecce".
In fact, in Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet on Tuesday the Casms that can also count on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which deal with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duke-Duce choirs and the heavy arm during Mamel's inn? In Bulgaria it's not done..."
This thought (expressed in a way that is really not happy) by Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks ago director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli previously was this Trieste where there was a nuclear support for the Ultras Italian group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it has not been able to inject the Duce, but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 typhoes has been shamed.
"I do not make the sociologist - add the Observer No.1 - the retries are assigned to the country in which the event takes place.
So far this group has remained in line, we will now see well what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But we're also talking about fish in Mamel's nest: they're also not real, but if I'm allowed, they're not education..."
