I can thank you for the fact that I've never been a fan at work.
I owe Tom a gift.
I owe you a meal.
I don't belong to you.
I got a car.
I think I'm more interested in finding the room at the traditional sex.
I'm planning on going there.
I'm playing Chopint.
I focused yesterday.
I'm going to go.
I'm tennis.
I'm kidding.
I like bikes better.
I love coffee better.
I love it that way.
I'd rather listen to radio than watch TV.
I'm in favour of the pirates.
I'd rather go.
I did it like he didn't understand it.
I promised my parents I wouldn't drink.
I promised the neighbor a victory.
I've made a competition for the neighbor.
I promised the neighbor I'd fight.
I promise, this won't happen again.
I promise I'll see you soon.
I asked for your hand.
I've got a bad button.
I'm making cream in my coffee.
I'm doing my coffee.
I'm sorry.
I bought a box.
I picked up the jacket on the other side.
I put the rest in the refrigerator.
I put the food in the refrigerator.
I've been eating it all the time.
I'd like to go back to my words, which were translated into other languages.
I'm running all the rest of my life this morning.
I ran like I did, but I've done my last job.
I ran away.
I ran into your brother on the street.
I went to my mother.
I'm reading a book at home.
You're reading it.
I read a lot of books.
I read some books.
I read this story in a book.
I appreciate your cooperation.
I really don't know where to start.
I'm saying I can't judge him!
I really don't think so.
I really don't want to do this.
I was really funny tonight.
I really like being alone.
I love city life very much.
I really love the bride, actually, this is my favorite week of the year.
I'll be there for the girl.
I really love your website.
I got a letter from my mother last night.
I received his letter without delay.
I got your message.
I recently met an old friend of mine.
I recognized her face.
I suggest you learn French.
I grew up like a paradise.
I rejected the offer.
I was sorry to see you in Australia.
I'm late.
I remember both of them.
I remember that too.
I remember the day we first met.
I remember Tom wearing a coat.
I reminded him of his obligation.
I respect Tommy.
I've been resting for four years.
I put my ass at risk for you.
First, take these bags out.
I'm gonna blow you up.
I'm five miles away today.
Fukok.
I've reopened the cave, sir.
That's what I said, but I didn't really think about it.
I told you this wouldn't be good.
I didn't say anything.
Thank you.
I fell asleep and scared.
I sat down with him.
I stopped thinking about it.
I stopped thinking.
I sat next to the driver.
My paradise is fruit or green?
I sat on the ground.
I saw a bear drive.
I saw a camel ride.
Last week, I saw a very good movie.
I saw Dana.
I saw him a week ago.
I saw it.
I saw John in the book.
I've seen more than Tom knows.
I saw one.
I saw something.
I saw it.
I saw the car crash.
I saw them.
I saw Tom dance with another girl.
I saw Tamá today.
I saw your name on the list.
I've cut the trigger.
I was hoping this would happen in secret.
I ran away.
I took a photo of him in secret.
I see a house.
I see a rose.
I see an unwed and an unwed woman.
I'll see you soon.
I see this.
I understand what you're thinking.
I was in danger.
I gave you flowers.
I served Tom with special powers.
Six main parts of the table.
I've got six.
Is everybody okay?
Is everybody here?
- Are you talking to everyone? - No, Tommy.
It's all right in the office.
Is everything ready?
Is the fast bread really sick?
Is French harder than English?
It's hard for France to escape?
Do you teach French in your schools?
Do you speak French?
Youtube's rape is a crime?
Is he sick or a doctor?
America?
Sir?
Is he my friend?
Is he tall?
I cut my hand with Tom, and I went.
I took my head off.
I should go there.
First, I should have asked Tom.
I should have asked Tom for help.
I should have been a movie star.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should've been there at the meeting.
I should have been more involved.
I should've been much more precise.
I should have been a lot more basic.
I should've been there sooner.
I should have brought more food.
I should have come here first.
I should've done that last week.
I should've done this somewhere else.
I should've done it with you.
I should have helped Tom do that.
I should never have come to Boston.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I should have admitted to do that.
I should've seen it coming.
I should've stayed with her.
I should have tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I think I should have done this.
I should have followed your advice.
I should have said I didn't feel it.
I'm kidding, but no one's listening.
I just want to know what this is about.
Is this a trap?
Are you okay if I call Tom?
Is this a joke?
Is it cold in Germany?
Is that dangerous?
Is it easy to learn to speak to an expert?
You're done?
Are you going to eat tomorrow?
It's hard to speak English?
Is that binding?
Is that normal?
Don't you mind if I sit here?
Is it?
Is this too late?
Is it true that Tom was after suicide?
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
You've been teaching the experiential for a week, right?
Is it true you woke up to look at Tommy?
Is it true that you like coffee?
Is the time running out?
Can fruit be paid more than coffee?
I'm so sorry, I'm late.
Laurie's gone?
I'm sleeping with two couples.
I slept with an hour after midnight last night.
I'm tired, and I'm ready for school.
I slept nine hours.
I asked my boss.
I raised the boy.
Mary Tom's mother?
Cigarettes.
Will the week be okay?
Am I clear?
I took a picture.
I got into the house.
I got into the house.
I'm sorry.
You like it now?
Didn't you have enough to ruin my life?
Well, isn't it a gymorrhage?
They gave it to him in the afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my mind hurts.
I'll get it sometimes.
Are there Paris?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I'm talking a little English.
I speak a little English.
I speak a little English.
I'm talking about a little rice.
I'm talking about a little rice.
I'm talking a little Russian.
At least I speak French every day.
I speak French and English.
I speak Spanish.
I've been with him all day.
I've been with them all day.
I moved all my money.
I moved all my money.
I transferred all the money I had to buy the book.
I was happy for an hour until I found out where to go.
I spent my first half of my life in the incubator.
I spent my first life in the incubator.
I spent the afternoon with my friends.
I spent the whole day in front of my machine.
I've been sitting down for three years for a crime I didn't follow.
I've been sitting down for three years for something I haven't even followed.
I've been telling you before.
Citrus is waiting for me.
Is it raining water?
Russia Europe or Asia?
Is he so important?
Is he your mother?
Are you really close to Sicilia Máltá?
I've been carrying papers all day, and now I'm pregnant.
I began to question his claim.
I've got it.
The tea is sweeter than the tea?
Is there an apology?
Is this your neighbor?
Titto?
Is that right?
That's sweet?
Is the room in the picture or is there a photo?
Is that the scene on the picture?
Is this my uncle?
Did they get this in the middle of it?
Is that a problem for you?
Is that really money?
Is there a scientific basis for this?
Did you think about that?
Is that so hard to understand?
Is this the problem?
Right?
But it's true?
Is that what everyone wants?
The cat's in the pocket, or under it?
Is the party clean?
Is the competition so bad?
What's the connection to the microphone?
Is the museum open today?
Do they have doctors?
Do you have a place to live?
Is there a subway in your city?
Is there a raise here?
Any doubts?
Is there any more of this?
Is there anything between you guys?
Is there anything else you want to know?
Do I have to do something?
You want to say something, Tom?
You got it?
Is there a free space?
Is there life before death?
Is there anything you'd rather like?
Is it in Iran?
Is he alive, or is he dead?
Is this a baby boy or a girl?
What's this?
Isn't it ethical?
Is this a fake?
Is that still alive?
Is this a joke?
Is this a sale?
Is that it?
Is this my place or yours?
Is that really alcoholic?
Is this really Jankovics Tamás' idea?
What's the matter with you?
Is that the right word?
Is this a disaster of imagination?
Does this want to be a trap of something?
Is that hard to understand?
Is this the key you're looking for?
Is that worth it?
Is this love for you?
You call this love home?
Is he your girlfriend?
Is that your money?
I still don't remember anything.
I still can't tell you why.
That was seven or eight years ago, exactly where were you?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to play.
There's one or two more things you need to put in your skin.
I still need to get some breakfast.
I still think it's the best choice.
Tom's Christian?
Tom's a good boss?
Tom's a good friend?
Tom's a good teacher?
Tommy's alive?
- Tom America? - No, Canadians.
I don't know.
Tom's dead?
Is Tom here?
Are you kidding me?
Tom's gone?
Tom Mária's son?
Is Tom ready?
Still sick?
I was standing by.
I brought you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I've been studying for two hours every day.
I'm teaching at school all the time.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I think you're already packed and ready for the launch.
I'm sure I've heard this voice somewhere.
I swear to you, that's why they're in trouble.
I'm a regular dog.
Two and a half miles a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
You're doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom here?
I don't think he's married.
It affects everyone.
There's no end until we're too close to him.
I'll take your place.
I'll work every day.
I talked to Tom a couple of times.
They're just waiting for you.
He's out of nothing.
It's better with your sister.
It's with the love I feel about you.
It's a lot more complicated than I thought it was.
These two euros are the price.
It could be a problem.
It could be love.
It's a shame to see all the work done in prison.
He's obviously grown up.
It didn't hurt.
I wasn't wrong.
That didn't help much.
He didn't stop talking.
There's nothing left to worry about.
It's too late to let you come.
You're not doing anything!
Anyway, who started it and why.
It doesn't look like they're in such a hurry anymore.
That doesn't look right.
You teach Chinese.
It's like they've been attacked by me.
I've come to realize that I've missed her.
It's been late the other day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
That's what happened in the beginning of the previous week.
That's what happened on our wedding day, darling.
There was something wrong with this.
It happened soon.
That was when he was out.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes in advance.
He's staying with everyone.
It's not good.
He's got his own value.
You've been drinking since two.
I think everyone else should have a diet.
I think everybody's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you're gonna be okay with your neighbors.
I'll find your queen forever.
I think he picked up some movies.
I think I'm capable of it.
I don't think I'd be smart enough to kill you.
I don't think I could kill him.
I don't think I understand.
I feel better.
I think there's an answer.
I think I'll get Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I guess I need more time.
It's like I've seen a pack.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom's time.
I think that's better.
I think it's right.
Very little probability, I think you'll be able to do that from yourself.
I think he's gone.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to have a baby.
I don't think that's fair.
I think so.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
I think it'd be better if you left now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you're gonna be okay with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I think something's wrong.
I'm gonna find the cops.
I think he's home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think you should forget that.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I think so.
I think there's no point in trying to convince him.
I think they've done a great job.
I think that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this doctor will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was there already.
I think it's Tommy's supervisor.
I think Tom's still out of work.
I think Tom's probably hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Tamás won.
I think we'll deal with him.
I think we should be patient.
I think we've turned into a bad direction somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I think you're all locked up now.
I think you called a bad number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what the name of Tamás' girlfriend is.
I think you'll be fine.
I think you look great.
I think you like it.
I think you got it.
I think you should go in personally.
I think you're the best girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your job is very good.
I think you're in a bad mood.
I don't think you were convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I thought about Tom.
I thought if we were going somewhere to eat, we'd get a drink.
I thought I could trust myself.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought maybe something was going on.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was getting worse.
I thought about my future.
I had a good idea of holding the key under the trigger, but it wasn't proven.
I thought Tommy was still in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
It hurts.
I'm under his influence.
It had a very powerful effect on me.
It's dangerous!
It's a historical color.
It's hard to get into the practice that he was talking about.
It's hard for everyone to get into it.
It's hard for everyone to do the same.
I'm afraid it's gonna work.
It's getting too late.
He's gone.
We're in half an hour after night.
Some people find it hard to understand.
It's the first time you start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every way possible.
It's my fault.
It's in the kitchen.
That's amazing!
They're gone.
This is my bedroom.
We need to get ready for the future.
You need a little rest.
It's never too late to learn.
I'm glad to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
You can't pull the trigger.
This isn't the best solution.
This isn't the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a cop.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one with Tom's problem.
It's not that expensive.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It doesn't work.
Maybe he's lying.
You don't have to talk to me all the time.
I'm sorry.
He's still moving.
Hey, it's really bad today!
Oh, my God!
It's four feet long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's a very easy task for him.
You're out of your mind.
It's a useful information.
The heat is great tonight.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you cut off the baby's play.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
He'll love us when we get home.
You'll be ready when you have to.
You'll be ready when you have to.
It's gonna take a little time to add to the visual examination.
He'll soon catch up with you.
It'll work if I clean up the polarizations.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need you here.
It's going to be a revolution.
Looks like you don't feel anything good here.
Looks like you thought about everything.
That makes me sad.
That depends.
It could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
It can save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try.
Maybe I'll be ready.
You're gonna have to move.
You have to report something.
I'm sure he loved me.
I'm sure they ran away.
You're gonna have to fix it.
It never existed.
It never should have happened.
Still, I lied to him that I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomina not to give up.
I told Tom where I got my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to go.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tommy.
I'd have a question, too.
We've been through so much.
I've been in the store for a long time.
I got it.
I'm on my 58th trip.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo last night.
I took my shoes off.
I absolutely forgot.
It'd probably be easier somewhere else.
Last night, the rain broke.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
There's a lot.
I'll give you two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I've introduced the United States in a search-and-run.
It's actually working.
It's really sad.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tomina.
I'd give up my life, too.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a good start.
It's a great cat.
It's a little early for the theory, isn't it?
It's a terrible word.
This is an easy situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least the paper.
It's a little bit of a rock.
It's a pet dog.
It's about half an hour.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen.
Kint's completely dark.
That's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
That's good and good, but will it work in practice?
That's all your fault.
It's 7:00.
He's in the process.
It's ten o'clock tonight.
One of my parents has always been that I live with a panda.
Always the same note.
It's a monster disaster.
It's an ocean business, Watson, an ocean, dangerous business, and the more I see, the less you like.
How bad!
Nice to meet you.
I'm glad Tommy's leaving.
It's a pretty big box.
It's a dream.
That's ridiculous.
It's just as art as much as science.
It's been a while.
He's in school.
A very dangerous sport where a little mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
I'm thinking about it.
It's a funny question.
That's terrible.
It was seven crazy.
It was a long day.
It was a wonderful trip.
It's a fun day.
It's hard today.
That's what happened before.
It wasn't a week ago.
He's been gone for two years.
That's better.
It's better to lock the paper tonight.
Fireplace.
Me.
It's easier to get to the bus.
It's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Wednesday.
It's closed on Wednesday.
Last night's close.
It's closed on Thursday.
It's dark at home.
It's cold.
It's cold.
It's cold, why don't you get a drink?
It's connected that the bear loves the honey.
It's all about Tom doing it or not.
That's perfectly normal.
It's okay now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's very nice!
He's ready.
It's not easier to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from the forest.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Mari.
It seemed to me an eternity.
Looks like the bus was ready.
That sounds completely familiar.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It's very weird.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom isn't blind.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
I think you're welcome.
I think you're wrong.
Looks like we're gonna be a regular guest.
It's Chinese to prepare for a race.
That's exactly what they want.
Honey.
It's a shame they get the same pay for the same job.
It's not perfect.
There's a forest out of the idealist.
This is yours.
You know, it's funny.
Let's get out of here.
Start to be perfect.
It's gonna be hard.
It won't be easy.
Good to see you in the morning.
It's good to be cool.
It's good to study.
It's great that he could come.
That's good.
It's not hard to get to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe it's been clean and it's time.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a way out of this city.
It's hard to put it in words.
It's hard to say.
It's hard to steal a towel.
It's really nice.
That's a big deal.
Magas.
The kids are already in bed.
You're gonna stop with the money.
He's better than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
It's important.
It's important that parents stand on one side when the line is raised.
It's important that we help them get into trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to fill in here.
You can't get air in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to make enough of your condition.
You don't know what tomorrow will bring.
I can't believe it, you know?
That's inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a feeling.
It's just that soon.
It's just a matter of time for Tom to get in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's too hard.
That's pretty serious.
It's really nice of you to go home.
It's nice to say that.
It's late.
He's on the move today.
It was like a marine field, and the technicians, the rats and the cats walked around like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
It's me.
It's amazing how you live.
It's too cold for the shower.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's what I think.
It's my skin.
I've got the case right now.
It's never too late for you to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as protective as it sounds.
At least he didn't make it.
That's not enough.
That's not gonna work out.
You can't change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not possible to negotiate.
It's not that far away.
It's not that simple.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what you see.
It's not important what you do, but how you do it.
It's not important to worry about it.
I didn't talk to you.
I didn't tell you.
I didn't tell you.
You don't mean to blame the priest if you don't witness the crime.
It doesn't make sense in the past.
It's been a year.
He's obviously broken up.
Of course not.
It's obviously weird.
Obviously, it's very painful.
It's not even bad if some of them keep their mouth shut.
It doesn't matter if you're a man.
- It took three months, and Tommy says he's talking to France all the time. - Yes, he's in a hurry. — What's the matter? — Dunning-Kruger-Efficacy.
Only three days.
The park's on the other side.
It sounds good!
It's over, right?
It's over.
It's personal.
Honey, I'd like to take you out of the woods.
She's got her hair cut off.
It's amazing.
It's probably convincing.
It's probably simple.
It is quite clear that this ambiguity is intended to reveal in the assessment of the labour market, in addition to the imperialism of the responsibility of the bloody wars that have been fought by it, and in order to ignore the idea itself, according to the aggressive attitudes of the people who have been involved in the endless wars of the world.
It's urgent.
There's rain in my heart.
A few large maps are found in Japan.
Really, isn't it?
It's really a big number.
He's out there.
It's impossible to ask someone how much he's looking for.
They say beautiful girls.
They say they'll soon leave Tokyo.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's a sea.
He's in Boston now.
It's so good to stay here!
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
This is the least I can do.
I think it's possible.
It's the same for everyone.
The same old problem.
You still have to answer that.
It's time for us to take our seats.
Let's get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
You should want my hair down now.
It's an idea of a drink.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's the best time to do something about it.

It's dear to me.
It's too cold right now.
It's late.
It's too late to worry about this.
It's a typical summer time.
It's a terrible thing to do.
It's round, cranky, and it's not harmonizing with anything, but at least it's not going to go into the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe not as stupid as you think.
I'm not sure anything serious will happen.
Now it's up to them.
You're gonna let us go there or not.
It's very beautiful.
It's very easy.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very funny.
It's very funny.
It's hard to live here.

Tom had to choose a few shoes for a long time.
He's been there for a long time, but he's finally been able to find him.
I've turned into a little lucky.
I've got it.
I'll take a break.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a brother-in-law.
It was a shame to do that.

It was a rough night.
It was a real challenge.

It was a crime, it was a time-consuming thing.
It was just a surprise.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost a heart attack.
It wasn't long before John was attacked by an idea.
It wasn't a very interesting giant.
It wasn't easy for me.
I didn't just keep my promise.
That was a big deal on the roof.
He wasn't interested.
I wasn't the one who locked the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't fun.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.
It wasn't the first time they did it.
It wasn't Tom.
It was just a joke.
I only knew the real purpose when I met him.
It doesn't hurt.
It happened last night.
It was pretty weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really fast.
It was really sad.
I was sure.
That was great.
That's all I could think about.
The worst pain I've ever had.
Tom's gone.
They were kept completely secret.
It was unlikely that he would marry her.
It was urgent.
It's been a few days. It's all over.
It's been a few days.
It'll be over in a few days.
It takes five or ten years for technology to be prepared.
It's gonna get pregnant again.
It's gonna happen.
He'll sleep a week if he doesn't wake up tomorrow.
This will threaten the welfare of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
You don't have to do that anymore.
You don't take much time.
It worked so well.
It's working perfectly on the iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It's hard to get out of here.
It would be pointless.
That would have been better if he had already made it.
It wouldn't be brave, it would be stupid.
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.
I underestimated Tom.
I see.
I understand it's not easy for you, but don't worry.
I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand what you're saying, but I can't.
I understand your problem.

I thought again.
I saw him with my own eyes and I heard him in my own mind.
I saw my father's voice.
I wasted my money.

I was in a dream.
I was proud to be trusted in Tommy.
I was afraid I'd never see him again.
I love it. I never see it again.
I was alone.
You missed me already.
I missed you already.

I went to Rome.
I was in the hospital for three weeks.
I was just in the mail.

I was half an ideal.
At first, I was nervous, but then I got a lot of rest.

I was one of the best teachers in the class.

I sat next to Tommy.
I couldn't talk.
I was with her.
I was still home then.
I was standing in the shower for a minute.
It's amazing what I know.
He surprised me to find the door open.
I was surprised when I found out that Tom was a Frenchman before.
They taught me to go first and then ask questions.
I was the greatest man in the world.
I was the last person I saw him.
I was the only one he didn't call.
I was the only one who survived.

I wish you had done that earlier in the morning.
I wish you'd let Tom finish his story.
Even if you don't.
I wish you wouldn't do that now.
I woke up.
I almost woke up.
I thought about what Tom wanted.
I looked like it, like I was.
I'm thinking about how I could do more.
It's just how much it's going on.
I'm hoping it works.
Do you know what time tomorrow is?
Is it a house?
Is there any easier way to do this?
Is there a man named Tamás here?
I'm curious if Tom's gonna be here tomorrow.
I'm curious what happened to Paula.
What did the printer want to say about this?

Who's responsible?
Why did he ask?
What's that so expensive?
I want to know why Tommy didn't come to Mari's party.
I got it!
I'm not gonna be here tonight.

I'd be mad if I didn't tell him the truth.
I'd be stupid to tell her nothing.
I'd be much more productive if I didn't waste my time online.
They'd love to.
I'd do it if I had more time.
I'd like her. I just don't have time.

I wouldn't say that.
I won't say it's right, and I won't say it's wrong.
I don't want to work with Tom.
I don't want you to get a bad impression on me.
I'd pay him to see me.
I'd better get out.
