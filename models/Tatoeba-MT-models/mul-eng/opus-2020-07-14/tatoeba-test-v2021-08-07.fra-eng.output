White pion to f3, black pion to e6, white pion to g4, black lady to h4 - black and mat! This is what is called by placiding in the circles of cheeks the "mat of the foot".
The whites: turn on a1, pion on b6, king on c8. The blacks: pion on a7 and b7, king on a8, foo on b8. The whites place the opponent in zugzang by playing the turn in a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the turn on a6 or move their feet to any other house of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pion from b6 to b7 and offer a check and mat. In the second situation, the white tour takes the black poon on a7, with the same result.
