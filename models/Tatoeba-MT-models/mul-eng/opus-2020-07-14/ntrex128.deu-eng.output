Members of the National Assembly for Wales feared the muppets
In some Member States, the proposal to amend its title in "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Valasian Parliament).
For this reason, plans are to change the name of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament (Valisian Parliament).
Members of the National Assembly of all political directions were forced to become the target of the spot.
A member of the National Assembly of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because the name “with “Twp” and “Pwp”.
For non-valid readers: In Welsh there is "twp" for "duff" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A member of the National Assembly of the Party of Plaid Cymru said that the whole group had “not been happy” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was closed against the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "muppet".
In this context, the Valásian letter is spoken in the English spoken in Yorkshire, as in the letter.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee), which is currently establishing a Law on Names, said: "The final decision on names for members of the National Assembly is of course with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Valais National Assembly to change its names.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which the ‘Wells Parliament’ was providing broad support to the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the national assembly members, the Welsh Parliament Members (Valisian Members) or the ‘WMPs’ group preferred the "MWP" option for the largest support in public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly appear to have alternative options, but the ring could pose a problem for President Elin Jones, who is to present a legislative proposal within weeks.
The Law on Reform will include further amendments to the working methods of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and the establishment of the Committee system.
The members of the National Assembly can finally vote on their behalf in their debate on the law.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on a change in the country's name
The electors decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The people's vote was set to contribute to a decade's fight with the neighbouring Greek country, which has a province with the same name as Macedonia.
Athens has long been saying that the name of its northern neighbours means that this claim is raised in the Greek area and has repeatedly been opposed to its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he will not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's sweating in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people whom I spoke to have given a bar and a church to every corner in the past,” said Adam.
"Today there is no more."
He said the disappearance of the bar would be adequate.
"The social life of the people looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where the people regularly find themselves."
He fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders accept, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with property dwellings in which people who do not support the remaining resorts.
"The overwhelming majority of the people who buy property dwellings in these buildings will be white," he said, "and in order to speed up the complete conclusion of these churches, it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these property dwellings will become members of these churches."
Both churches were created by white communities before Harlem became a black Metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist community emerged in the 1930s.
A black community that occupied their service to God in the vicinity became owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who introduced a boycott from individual dealers in 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, which refused to install or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was badly damaged, but as Father Johnson’s community members planned to rebuild, they ordered the block game.
Reverent David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, called the bell game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the bell game in July used other words: “A cultural drama” and “an unprecedented historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first watch game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind. He was changed to the largest clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been played in the last few months in St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been added to the ranks of the church leaders and to the part of the Bishop's Diocese.
In July, the Community Board, the management body of the Community, which is responsible for the management of the Community, expressed in writing against the Diocese that the Diocese would try to extend the costs to the Community body, although it was not involved in the transmission of the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some members of the Community complained about lack of transparency on the part of the Diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds when they were born to Lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, after official statements, a 13-year-old boy hit a Hai at the baptism of Lobster.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the sender of KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been with friends for about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy's help cry and went with several others to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel said he had first thought the young man was happy to have caught a thief. But then he realized that the young man cried: “I have been eaten!
I'm hungry!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire key line was up.
“I write that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’ added Hammel.
The young man was fled to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of host responsible for the attack was unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said to the media that a shark had been seen a few weeks ago in the area. However, if you had come to the conclusion that it wasn't about a dangerous skin dealer.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials stopped access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 horses in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's Plant Prestoch on the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's works on boats, superdrugs, and Debenhams with specialized assistants.
Within the framework of a large set of proposals on the 2,8 billion British pounds cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, during fashion and budgeting purposes, the larger cosmetic shares in eleven branches will be tested countrywide. If they appear successful, they will be extended to other branches in the next year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to the search for supermarkets by means of possibilities, prior to using other loading areas used for television equipment, micro-vehicles and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's data, the volume of its cosmetics initially doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twozerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Previous series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and brand areas than in business like boats.
In addition, the Supermarket runs a launch of its "Boutique" series, so that most of the products are veganer-friendly – a aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the brand-new Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's Fillial sales sites. The first shop was opened in Croydon in southern London, and a second will be opened in the further course of this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to daily purchase of small quantities of food in local demand products means that supermarkets need to do more to allow customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsburys, sales are increasingly seen as buyers, as the supermarket chain tries to fight against the discounter Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has since bought the chains Argos and Habitats two years ago in hundreds of Argos branches and has also set up a number of Habitats. This has increased food supply as well as the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt to reorganise the supermarket, its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments was broken down.
In the beginning of 2000, Sainsbury tested a joint Venture with boats, which ended after an announcement on the distribution of revenue from the offices of the drug dealer in the supermarket.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branches of pharmaceuticals to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company announced that Lloyds will play a role in the plan immediately when an extended palette with luxury skin care marks, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, purchase director at Sainsburys, said: “We have designed the appearance of our cosmetics to create an attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in dedicated colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand pallet is cut down on all needs. Due to the moving environment and the affordable locations, we are now an attractive target for cosmetics, which asks the previous type of purchase."
Peter Jones "witend" after the return of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
"Dragons" The Star Peter Jones is "winterend", after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has returned from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle-style company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common home-year and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Marke Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced her return to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby released “Dragons” The Star Peter Jones through her extremely short-term return from her lucrative life-style company to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones should have been "wheat" when the "Golden Girl" of the television was able to devote not enough time to the common homeware and accessory market due to its new business – in the value of up to 1.5 million British funds – to the combined homeware and accessory brand Truly on the day of the service.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Marke Goop and had probably doubled the estimated wealth of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her return from Truly to Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to a holiday show.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly.
It should ensure for them long-term future over the next decades.
Your decision to return was totally surprising for all participants.
No one could believe what happened on the service day, so shortly before the market was introduced.
In the capital in Marlow, a store house is waiting for full goods to be sold."
Experts believe that the return of the "This Morning" moderator, which belongs to the most successful star in Britain, could cost the company, due to high investment in products of cheeses and cheeses, to clothing and homeware and possibly further delays in marketing.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Cap, and Jones, 52, became president in March.
The couple spend their vacation together, and Jones has a share of 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to be a brand warehouser for M&S and to replace Ant McPartlin as the moderator of the ITV message "I'm A Celebility".
A jones near Source said last night: "We don't comment on his business affairs."
Hard words "and then we loved ourselves"
He was concerned about the criticism he received from the media for a comment that would be considered "not presidential" and for such positive remarks on North Korea's leadership.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said that the voice of a news moderator was:
"I didn't say anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore was awarded in June of Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have been put into stock.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top North Korea diplomat, said that the United Nations General Assembly, on the same day, would not see the US 'agreed response' in North Korea.
Instead, he established that the United States had imposed sanctions to maintain the press.
Trump proved to be significantly optimistic in his community.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We are facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the dead remains of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way to talk about Kim’s relationship.
"It is so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to get back into this crowded Arena, about 200 people would be here," said Trump, pointing directly to the crowd before him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroyed an island and cost hundreds of lives in Indonesia
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they would not be used.
Although over 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, there has been no national emergency, a prerequisite for the mobilization of international assistance.
"Further, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not require international support, which is therefore difficult," said Summing.
While creating a team to travel to Palu, Save the Children is still not sure whether foreign workers can work in the area.
Sutopo, spokesmen of the disaster protection authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu whether international bodies should participate in the aid measures.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia has to continue to fight, the country is still prepared as unfortunately bad to natural authorities.
While in Aceh Tsunami protection centres, these are not a daily approach to other coastal routes.
Despite a warning in force, apparently missing Tsunamiwarsin in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between many islands of Indonesia has already presented a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazarusretship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of Earth's resources is headed to Palu, but the location of the new disaster will be reached in the first three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the associated Indonesian infrastructure for the core of his election campaign and has raised enough money for roads and roads.
However, the government of the Joko seeking re-election in the next year leads to funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is suffering from persistent confision tensions in Indonesia under pressure. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes and apartments, as bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with masks, rifles and bows, as well as other primitive weapons.

The number of deaths of the tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the disaster protection authority announced on Sunday morning.
Many people were to be caught in the earthquake of buildings, which, through the earthquake of the strength 7.5 on Friday, which had set up up up to six meters high, reported to a press conference by the authorities Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.

Police take a man, 32, for murder, after a woman was shot
After the foundation of a woman-like today in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police call on the residents to report if they have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask all those who have stayed close to John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious about us.
In addition, I ask all the people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something from a Dashcam, to contact us. They may also have information that is of greater importance to our investigation."
A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today's afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman are in touch with Tatorto to discover where she was found this morning.
The investigations were under way, and the police shared that it was about to inform the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to reach his apartment, but the police informed him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he experienced what had happened.
The inhabitants are now informed that it will take hours until they can share the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the whole area will be treated as tatort.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She keeps saying, "This is so scary."
At 14:00 a.m., two police vehicles are in the midst of the interruption and another vehicle before the interruption.
In the meantime, several police officers were in charge of the housing block.
People who have information will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC to call number 101 or to use it under number 0800 555 111 anonymously to criminals and refer to protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell Statute before Parliament will be the newest memory of the party on the translation of history.
Its binding would be poetic justice for its destruction of so many cultural and religious works of art in England by its fanatical Puritan allies.
The Cromwell Society, however, described the Cricks proposal as “tourity” and “try to describe the history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the image of Oliver Cromwell became a target before the Palace of Westminster.
The image tower in the English Civil War was neither organised by Cromwell nor performed.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be offered for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycrofts' wonderful exhibition of Cromwell is proof of the dominant opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that is still worth much.
Goldsmith said regarding the Sunday Telegraph: “Crowell will be protected by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, than anyone who sees Parliament against pressure outside, in his case of course through the monarchy.
Whether it is a fully-fledged exhibition, the subject of ongoing history debates is the subject.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique figure that represents a side of this wave.
Its services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating them and remembering them."
Killer Swwein belongs to Chinese farmers
Local media reports followed a farmer on a market in the southwestern China was attacked and killed by a woman.
The man, to whom the name "Yuan" was only named, was found in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A female builder is willing to inject a female vaccine in Xining, Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, he made reports with his cousin from the nearest province of Yunnan to sell 15 women on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him up and saw that a door was open to a nearby Swiss station.
He said there was a large male woman in the stable with blood on the Schnause.
According to the report, a federal investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of pregnant women had touched the farmers.
"The legs of my cousins were bloody and twisted," the cousin, named after "Wu", was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Taking a security camera showed how Yuan worked the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his wives.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the woman had been arrested to prevent attacks on other people while the police gathered evidence material at Tatort.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are dealing with reports of a loss for his death.
It is rare to attack women, but such cases are known.
In 2016 a woman and her husband were arrested on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago a 290-kilo hard woman wore a woalous tree between herself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could break down the animal.
After a farmer was released in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said against CBC News that Sweden would normally not be aggressive, but the taste of blood could work as a “exsolver”.
“They’re just toys.
They're very curious and they're not going to hurt anyone.
You only have to treat them with the right way," he said.
The remnants of Hurrikan Rosa bring widespread strong rivers in the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurrikan Rosa weakens on the way over the cooler water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring out rainfalls in North Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m., Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a hurricane of category 1, and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will reach the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific is starting to form a bridge that is heading east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Bay California semi-trailer on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical moisture is transported to the north in the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will be released on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimetres of the Netherlands.
Then, the tropical humidity in the coming days is caused by the effects of changes with the rising drought, which have expanded strong south-westerly.
Local can cause dangerous fluttering overflows, water-flowing protection and possibly soil erosion in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to lower rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west, in particular in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimetres are expected to fall.
Due to the stress of tropical floods, there is the possibility of fluttering overflows with rapidly worsening conditions.
In view of the disturbing tropical declines, it is urgent to walk into the desert.
Strong downwards can lead to rising currents from Canyons, and the wind brings local wind bubbles as well as wind that leads the dust with it.
The next round brings locally strong rivers in parts of the coast of South California.
It is possible that the total number of tyres of more than one centimetre can lead to a low level of water-producing protection and smooth journeys.
This would be the first decline in rain time in this region.
The first combined tropical raindrops reach Arizona on Sunday and Monday. On Monday and Tuesday, it is spreading.
On Tuesday, the four-Corners region spreads stronger rivers and spreads through the middle of the week.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the arctic cools, while the troops remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday in the middle of the United States, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 °C.
In the next days, the continuous summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the Middle and East of the United States, a warm beginning in October is expected with extended temperatures of 27 °C from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast points to a high probability of excessive temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million visitors have seen the audience of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million viewers have seen the shocking statements of the Supreme Court board Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s on Thursday.
In the meantime, the political pact was held. The television transmitters interrupted their regular program on Friday because of a last-minute application: an agreement by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to conduct a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Committee that 100%ig was sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, that she was pregnant and tried to remove her dress.
Kavanaugh said in a sad statement that he was 100% sure this wasn't happening.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million visitors reported by Nielsen have seen the audience.
The company reported the average attendance rates at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had deleted the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has a general problem with measuring attendance rates in offices.
To turn this into the right perspective: This corresponds to the attendance rates at a play-off football game or at the Oscar competition.
The sending Fox News Channel, whose minor-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, reported by Nielsen with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the entire day's hearing the highest number of all networks.
ABC came with 3.26 million visitors to second place.
CBS had reported that Nielsen 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million visitors.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that would result in his vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras, as protesting him on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
The scene was transferred alive to CNN.
"I stand right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you believe that he speaks the truth to the country?"
"They have power, while so many women are free," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added before the board concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the Committee.
All cable and circuit networks were sent hours later live when the Committee on Justice should vote on the extension of the appointment of Kavanaughs to vote on the whole Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would only do this under the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, seeks to investigate charges against candidates in the next week.
Flake is partly convinced by the surprises of a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After training with Coons and subsequent various senators, Flake made his decision.
The smooth decision was of great importance, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump commissioned a FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May charged in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times critic of her plans for Austria from the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and undermine the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet on September 29, 2018 as part of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In addition to the interview with her on the title page of the newspaper, she supported her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson's attack on her so-called “Checkers Plan” for Brexit by calling a proposal that proposes the mutual involvement of debts by Britain and the EU as “completely absurd”.
Killing shots on Wayde Sims: Police take suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police have found a suspect in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested after being told by the baton Rouge police.
The authorities published video recordings of the association between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reported, the police assured the Brilley at Tatort and said that Simpson's DNA had been found on the Brilley.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police told him he had the killer shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the rent has been fixed at US$ 350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office published a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death was a shock on the neck.
The police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the technical lab of the federal police, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation.
LSU Sports Director Joe Aleva thanked the Regional Executive Authority for "their concern and their efforts for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m large flying player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team was about Waydes death "darked" and "sucked under shock".
"For such a thing there is always fear," said Wade.
Vulkan sprays ass on Mexico City.
The southern quarter of the Mexican capital, Vulcan Popocatepetl, which was released from the Asche, has reached the southern quarter of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater was taken and 183 explosions of gas and steel were registered within 24 hours.
The Authority reviewed numerous cases of throats and seizures.
Pictures in social media showed thin asches on the windscreens of cars in four parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists, since September 2017 had a earthquake of the 7.1 Central Mexico, established increased activity on the 72 kilometers south-east of the capital.
The Vulkan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Consequences between the police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence agreement
In Barcelona, six persons were arrested on Saturday after meetings between the police and the Pro-Independency demonstrators. Thousands of others participated in demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro separatists, who were detained by the police, maintain dark dust clouds with eggs and other colorful powders, thus creating dark dust clouds in the normally popular streets with tourists.
During the next day, it also came to work with the police, who used their shells to defeat the fighting.
Several hours ago, the group of Pro-Independency groups "Don't forget, don't forgive," were opposed by the Unionists calling "long live Spain".
As the local press reported, 14 people were treated for minors in the protesting of injuries.
However, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid saw as illegal, celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The electors had decided with overwhelming majority for independence, although the electoral division was low, since the rebels voted mostly in favour of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were tortured in the last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent conflicts before the elections.
Pro-independence groups had campaigned on Friday night in the open to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he saw the prospects that Catholics would achieve independence, not with hope anymore.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents happy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important fact, even though few, in the last December regional elections, the Catalan pro-independency parties had difficulty in maintaining the momentum of this year. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in their own exil or in port, where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in the organization of the referendum and the related declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest to the police on his phone, said that the conflict was protected by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more and more exciting," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in charge of the investigation since the end of the last year, announced his candidate for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best opportunity to start the development of democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonerry: Men were arrested after the car house was destroyed

The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 p.m. after British summer.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the tower and the building were damaged themselves.
In addition, it may have been shot at the car with an armbrush.
Multi-treffle means for Livingstone 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first tower for Livingstone guaranteed victory.
The raised Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second download for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Vereins.
Dolly Mengas metffer proved to be decisive that Gary Holt's husband was able to match with Hibernian in the second half of his life.
Gerrards Manschaft remains in the premiership in this season, and the next Sunday is against the hearts of the eight points.
First, the rangers are on Thursday in Europe League Guests for Rapid Vienna.
Livingston can, in the meantime, increase his victory series in the division on six games, which means that the chief of the Holt has not yet registered any download since he was taken over by Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston prefers opportunities against instant playful guests
Holts team had already been in charge for a long time before the attack, as its direction put the rangers in front of the various problems.
Scott Robinson went through, however, and became more slow before the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot a little longer after he was re-examined to meet Craig Halket's head in the gate.
Guests were happy to let the Rangers play before themselves, knowing that they could stop the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive tower came.
The Rangers set up a free zone, and Livingston prepared a chance to bring Declan Gallagher and Robinson together to the town. This opened the door with a ball contact from the middle of the street.
In this phase the Rangers had dominated the ball estate, but could not overcome the customer's deviation, and Torhüter Liam Kelly remained largely unsatisfied.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once insisted on rejecting it.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by the Ranger's Tourhütter Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow took the ball from another standard situation in Livingstone.
Flankes were again caught in Livingstone’s Strafarum and were regularly taken from the area of danger, while two required punishments – one of Halket's attempts against the changed Glenn Middleton and one of his due to play – were rejected.
"Phnomial" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingstone.
They were extremely excellent and the prospects for this rise again prevailed.
Their performances and their team have not changed since their return to the top team, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has raised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was great and led to an excellent organized revolution, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on Trab during the entire game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
So well they were under Gerrard too, they couldn't achieve this standard.
Her last ball was not enough – only once they could push the guest's men – and it's like a week round for the Rangers that are in the middle of the table.
Receive erdogan with mixed reactions in cells
On Saturday (September 29th), light faces and blue sky prevailed when the government superintendents of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin at breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There were disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the EU's accession to Turkey.
Next, Erdogan travels to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons for them to hold a strong amount of 25,000 people to collect before the mosque. However, many of the delegates were close to seeing their presidents.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators — many of them Kurds — also became members. They condemned Erdogan's policy as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The parallel protests reflect the polarising effect of the visitor, which is recognized by some Germans as hero and is admired by others as autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Motorcycler dies in combination with car
At a car interview, a driver came to London about life.
The meeting took place about 10:15 a.m. of British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and Healthiers took care of the man who died in the accident.
A month before the accident, another driver was in an accident with a driver's flight in the Children's Street, about 1.6 kilometers away from the accident on Saturday, to come to life.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and inform his next members.
Road restrictions and directions for buses are set, and car drivers have been forced to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured in accidents
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were tortured in a high-security prison for men.
On Sunday, about 9:30 a.m. of British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stop.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were added to end the disturbances involving eight persons and limited to a flight.
The staff were treated locally for minor injuries in the face.
A speecher from the Prison Service said: “It was used specifically in prison to address a more persistent incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police officers will be handed over and that perhaps they will spend a long time behind the gates."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison leader was reported to have been treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, employees were called into prison to prevent serious disturbances in which the personnel were attacked with pool waves.
Hurrikan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluttery overflows (may be benefiting remote areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression will reach Arizona, but that is exactly what will likely happen next week when the rest of Hurrikan Rosa will take over the south-easts of the desert and take the risk of fluttering overflows.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings against fluctuations on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada and to the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa is approaching the Montagabend with rain and goes directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “from 1950 only 10 tropical Cyclones as tropical storm or tropical depression of Phoenix have been nearing 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) is a Hurrikan within 64 kilometers away from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of the Netherlands with a range of up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are probably 2.5 to 5 centimetres, and can be combined to up to 10 centimetres.
For those who do not have the risk of fluttering overflows, the downsides associated with Rosa may be a blessing because of the doors in the region.
Although overexhaustments are of great concern, these rivers are likely to be useful in part, as they are now dominated by door.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, some 40 percent of Arizona's minimum extreme door, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
Firstly, the path of the Hurrikan means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have the maximum wind of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. The Hurrican will then be taken 19 kilometers per hour north.
In the Pacific, the storm will be hit by colder water and then disappear.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will meet on Monday or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on the ground.
In parts of Mexico, the low levels can be severe, so there is a significant risk of overheating.
“From Baja California to the north-west of the Sonora West, Dutch volumes of 7.5 to 15 centimetres are expected, with up to 25 centimetres possible”, said weather.com.
Next, Rosa will be taken as a tropical storm in northern Mexico, on early Tuesday as a tropical depression, reach the border to Arizona and then, until later, through Arizona, to the south of Utah.
"As a major threat in relation to Rosa or her remnants are expected to be very strong downwards in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora West and the south-west of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these downwards, life-threatening fluctuations in the desert are expected and three-way protection as well as in mountainous areas of the earth are expected.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests due to attempted murder
After the foundation of a 16-year-old with stichwungs in Somerset, three boys were arrested at the age of ten and a 20-year-old man under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found wounded on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. of British summer time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
The officials are asking everyone who has access to the records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had been “under the community, the White” of Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unsuspecting and unsound tactics of the Democrats," Trup said at a competition in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during the entire nomination process, Kavanaugh had been “under the community, the world” of Democrats.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the convention and showed that Christine Blasey Ford's accusation was brought back, he had her sexually charged as both teenagers decades ago.
Ford also said when listening to her complaint.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brightness, the quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal leaders of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the public service," he said in West Virginia.
The President spoke directly about the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the elections.
“Five weeks before one of our most important choices in life.
I don't get started, but I actually get started," he said.
"That is why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission in it, "to deliver and block."
The first important procedural vote on the appointment of Kavanaughs is expected to take place at the Senate at the latest on Friday, a high-ranking staff member said against CNN.
Hundreds killed on Earthbeds in Indonesia, increase bids
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were forced to flee because of a strong earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when, at the time of the darkness, up to six feet [6 m] high on the beach, many people ran to death and destroyed everything they were on their way.
Tsunami was a quake of 7.5 strength.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, the people still went to the beach and did not immediately find out about it, and they fell to the victim," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Indonesian disaster protection authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it blew cars, trees and houses with, it hit the country everything," said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami was taken at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before it hit the coast.
Some people were dressed on the flight before the tsunami and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
A number of damaged buildings and shops, closed and unfurnished bridges, as well as a water-conditioned mosque, have been published by the disaster protection authority.
On Saturday, the coastal city was struck by further floods.
In one area, the earthquake killed 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the nuclear bombs fired at Hiroshima in the massive wave of energy released from the day.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, small book, Tsunami could have become larger, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as “absorbed” and indicated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels would be inundated.
According to his statement, the bodies of some victims were found under the trunks of one-storey buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damages along the coast had been 300 km north of Palu, in a area with the name Donghea, which is closer to the epicenter of the bee.
The communication with Donghea was completely effective according to the words Nugrohos, and it did not provide any information.
According to a report of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the areas concerned.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," it said.
On Saturday, the Authority was criticised for not having reported that a Tsunami Palu had been attacked, although the waves were officially identified at the time of the warning.
Amateur captures published in social media show a man in the upper roof of a building, which doubles people on the street before the nearby Tsunami.
Within minutes, a waterway is powered on the floor and cools buildings and cars from there.
Reuters could not verify the accuracy of the recordings immediately.
The Bebes and Tsunami have resulted in a massive fall in the communication about Palu and called on the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo vehicles with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the Evacuators still need urgent food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remained closed until October and was only reopened for aid measures.
For Sunday a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in the center of education in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to over 800.
The situation is very bad.
The workers of World Vision from Dongdraa have certainly achieved the city of Palu, where the workers were transferred to the inner courtyard of their office, but have gone through the words of Dosebas on the road to the scene of destruction.
"They told me they had seen many broken houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups started with the hard task of putting disaster relief in place, some showed that professional foreign aid on the trip to Palu would be prevented.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are possible only when the place of an accident has been declared to the national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"At the moment there is still a disaster on the province," said Aulia Ariani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OKA, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support.
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami on Palu, friends and family members of those still missing for these are one of the wonders that echo the tragic stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a small boy was taken from a water channel.
On Sunday, the rescue forces released a woman who had been buried two days below the body of her mother.
Gendon Subannon, the trainer of the Indonesian Paragliding National Mission, had trained two of the missing paraglids for the beginning of this month in Indonesia at the end of the year.
Others who were arrested in Roa-Roa-Hotel, as Mandiya had added, were his students.
"As an elder in Paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told us how in the hours after he made the message from the Roa-Roa hotel's inside the paraders, whatsApp messages had sent to the combat participants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
His messages, however, led to rather than to blue hecks than to gray frescoes.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Diebe is worth $26,750 while filling a cash machine in Newport on the Level

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
At the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The official beings known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been using the title Ye for a while and has used it as the title of his eight albums published in June.
The change takes place at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of its new albums “Yandhi” is expected.
He is quoted as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, said that he was “emotional reasons”.
The word is not only a summary of its current professional name, but it has a religious significance, according to its own statement for the West.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with Radio Moderator Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From Kanye, which means “the only” is “Yes” – simply a reflection of our good, our evil, our enemies, of everything.
The album reveals more about what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known by the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he knew that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously worked with the West, has also written his names with and without the bindery and the capital letters.
Mexico AMLO allows the military not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, agreed never to use military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza, “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the site and killed 300 people. At this time, left-wing students had to move to establish themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador agreed to support young Mexicans through monthly assistance for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training had led to young criminal gangs.
The US should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of the enhanced activities of China in the field of artistic intelligence, the United States should double its research expenditure in this area, says Investor and KI-Fu Lee, who was active at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI announcements from various areas of the US government, even if the United States is generally lacking a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China submitted its plan in the last year: the country intends to reach No 1 in the area of KI innovation by 2030.
"The duplication of the budget for the KI research would be in view of the fact that all other countries return so much to the United States, a good start. We are looking for the next KI gap." said Lee.
The duplication of financial resources could double the chances that the next major KI success would be achieved in the United States, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that visited the highest-ranked American Othello player. Later he was leading leadership at Microsoft Research and President of the Google news station in China.
The former U.S. government, like the robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), was pleased to ask about the next competition, since he wanted to help identify the next viewers.
According to Lees, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"China does not take the academic powers away, but the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up in recent years the curriculums of universities to work on KI.
According to Lees, an amended immigration policy of the United States could also be beneficial for the KI exercises in the United States.
"I think that people promoted in the KI should be offered automatically Greencards," he said.
In July 2017, China State Council proposed its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Read words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people on academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money on US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where the partner from industry and science was to participate. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a Special Intelligence Committee.
DARPA also announced the investment of 2 billion US dollars this month in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in the KI research.
In the meantime, there has been nothing done in the United States concerning the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians voted in referendum on a change in the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia agreed in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed in the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would be a decade old struggle with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province on behalf of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours means that this claim has been raised in the Greek area, which is why Greece has put a Veto against the arrest of Macedonians into NATO and the EU.
However, the two governments concluded in June an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum. A Boykott campaign is in doubt that the electoral participation is 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the vote was raised: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change in the name of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that Macedonia, one of the countries taken up from Yugoslavia's collapse, is worth the price in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union's screen, as this means a secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, many Members have said that they would hold to the outcome so that it is decisive.
The amendment would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said it had not reported irregularities until 1 p.m..
However, only 16 per cent of the electoral participation was compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 per cent of the registered voters voting.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a elector in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dushko, gave her voice on 30 September 2018 in Struca, Macedonia, in the referendum on the change in the country's name, which would open the way for NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage before the Parliament in Skopje, and presented chairs in front of cells that were set up by people who wanted to book the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we would like to join the leaders, not through the intervention," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we would.
If they do not want us as Macedonians, we can use others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will have an urgent impact on Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will be for this because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
According to his words, a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday, between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum. This figure is below the necessary electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telema TV sender revealed that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the vote must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A shadow of the referendum would be the first difficult blow to the probationary government's policy since its adoption in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Bridgeton bridge to reach the tower
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the Bridgeton Abbehr on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester at 2:0 p.m. from Manchester City.
Aguero left his encounter in the 65s. Minutes slightly.
The Argentinan attacker received a passport in the middle of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green triangles.
He played around a protector here and then held several more defenders at the border of Brighton’s strike.
Next he took a step left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the resort to play the ball back to Aguero, who crossed with his right Schuh Brighton Tower Matthew Ryan and shot at the right side of the network.
"Aguero struggles with problems in his feet," said the City Manager Pep Guardiola against reporters.
“We had spoken about he should play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were happy that he had reached a door right now."
However, it was Sterling who transferred Sky Blues to the initial advantage in the Premier League Duell.
This tower fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball at this train far away on the side of Brighton.
He had a good ride along the left bank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling on a long corner.
The Sky Blues gave the ball into the net shortly before he ran out.
The city plays in the Championships League group on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hopenheim.
Scherser wants the Rockies to lose the game
Since the nationals have been expelled from the playoff competition, there was little reason to impose another use.
However, the ever-increasing shadow always hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies that have a game in the NL West before the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least a wild card with a 5-2 victory over the nationals on Friday, but still wanted to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, we can at least play because we know the atmosphere in the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would like this year.
Why should I not participate in this competition?"
The nationals have not yet announced a launch for Sunday, but they have refused reports to let tears run in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the 34th starter on Thursday in the Bullpen and would play on his normal day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington Lawyer has shown this season a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 injections.
Trump holds customer service in West Virginia
The President addressed the situation directly in relation to the board Kavanaugh, chosen by him for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the elections.
“All we have done is on the game in November.
Five weeks before one of our most important choices in life.
That's one of the big, big – I don't get on, but I actually get on, so I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take the power again with all the means, you see the community, the dissuasiveness.
It is for them whoever harms them, who must overcome them to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission, "to stand still and block."
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "afflicted and friendly and unsuspecting and unsuspecting."
He called for the highest democracy in the Senate's judicial committee, Senator Diane Feinstein, which released Buhrufe at the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.”
The work will no longer apply to all opinions.
The party is intolated against those who say it.
When the instant activists in my local party agreed to call me, this was a little bit surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of lab officers who are told that they are not welcome – just because we say it.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had given up energy against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised by the Father's decree for having a different opinion as Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironically on similar issues, of Jeremy with former top politicians was not an opinion.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labor on Friday meant that “the meetings should be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the free-standing GC meetings in my eight years were exactly that as local labor coordinator.
Today, most of the meetings have not been touched by this tone, and the promised "more friendly, more sensitive" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has already begun.
It will always be clear that different views in the Labour Party will not be tolerated and that each opinion will then be assessed whether they will be accepted by the Party Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a partner. Ladies and gentlemen, whom I believed to share similar political views before, now expected me to make a return use and to adopt positions that I would never have agreed otherwise – whether on national security or on the European internal market.
When I always speak publicly – where there is no role in what I say – there is a scarcity in the social media that appeals to my grandmother, initiates the political media, and says I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues, since the comments I have made on me are mostly political nature.
I admire the professionality and resolve of the colleagues who daily face a flood of sexual or racist abuses and yet have not contributed very little.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political era is that decisions have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn asked last week to promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we will no longer be able to apply all opinions, and the party will be more closely informed by any mishap and any amendment to the electoral rules.
In the last two years, I have often been tempted to put my head in the head and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have "no problems".
But I didn't get involved in politics.
Since I became a student 32 years ago, accompanied by the closure of the Thatcher government, because of my classroom in the general school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them at the most – as a community director as well as a cabinet minister.
I've never made a joke from my political views, nor at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was able in any way to change my political positions and areas where I do not agree with the current leadership, in ignorance.
In view of the fact that the country is being threatened by a Brexit, the budgets, companies and our public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I do not refer this message to Nottingham moment, but to my voters, whether they are labor members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not cease to do so much of what I think is the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unavoidably Ayr team rises to the peaks
Two later attempts may have failed something, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this extremely interesting game of the day in the Tenent's Premiership.
You're now the only ten men who're unchallenged at the table.
Finally, the success of the household was to bring back to its survival as well as to its best chance evaluation, and Coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been put to the test in our games so far, and we are still unsatisfied, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have valued their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led by Ayr. However, Melrose was able to obtain a yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who was released for the game of the Warriors, and Jason Baggot found an unexplained attempt.
Climo built the leadership of Ayr with a penalty, before he had obtained a hit directly in half time and then had an increased attempt in isolation, so it was at break 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Next came a longer interruption due to a severe destruction by Ruarh Knott, which was carried out by the game field. After the continuation, Ayr built his original by an increased attempt by Stafford McDowell.
Then, as the captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a silver card, and Melrose was able to pay the additional man at the end of a phase with an unexplained attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the household came back, and as Sruan Hutchinson for tackling without ball against Climo, he received a yellow card, designed by MacPherson from the punishment gas from a shower down behind the outstanding Ayr package.
Climo grew as almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's boxkick and had sent the flame player Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the household.
Still Game Star seems ready for new careers in the gastronomy
“Still Game” Star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a change in the guest business after it appeared to be known as the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC send, whose comic books he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The two have announced that the previous nine steps will be the last of the mission, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official applications, he is the manager of Afförmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan was interested in increasing "floating restaurant business" in Glasgows.
"The sea belongs to us": The Bolivian State-owned hope that a court will open the way for peace
Matrozen patrols in front of the well-dressed marine capital in La Paz.
On public buildings, a multi-colored fence is painted.
The motto is: “The sea is our rightful property.
It's a duty to get back."
As far as Bolivia is concerned in the country, the memory of the resource lost in a bloody conflict in Chile in the 19th century is still alive as well as the request to travel over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a court of the International Court of Justice to be held on 1 October following five-year consultations.
"Bolivia has the feeling, a spirit of unity and tolerance, and looks forward to the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are following the IGH’s judgment on large screens, hoping that the Court will decide in the Hague on a request from Bolivia. According to this, Chile is obliged, after decades of sporadic talks, to negotiate a sovereign access to Bolivia to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic Indian president, who is in charge of a controversial fight for his election next year, is also very much at the trial on Monday.
"We are just about to return to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts feel it is unlikely that the court would decide to favor Bolivia and believe that this would change little.
The UN body with its seat in the Netherlands is not authorized to speak in Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not be decided on the outcome of possible talks.
The judgment of the IGH has already been delivered six months after the closing of the Chamber, in view of Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, concludes that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a relapse.
"The current Bolivian government has addressed the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She pointed out that Morales' war history has touched every remaining good Willen Chiles.
Bolivia and Chile will sometimes continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not served as ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in De Haag, showed the view that the decision of the Court was not usually quickly taken.
On Monday, Bolivia has “a extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “preparate the conflicts of 139 years for mutual benefit”, he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – use the subject of the sea as a political circle.
"Bolivia will never be entitled to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to recognize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says the atomic equipment will only be found if it can trust the USA
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never cease its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to implement the agreements made in Singapore during a summit between the Heads of State of the Rivers.
His remarks came at a time when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the summit with the North Korean state capital Kim Young-un, in Singapore, seems to be about to take back the established nuclear diplomacy.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and the resistance of the United States to a declaration against the end of the Korean War would sometimes force the north into the knee, as a "Hingespinst".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the statement without first taking essential disarmament steps.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second drop.
However, it is well known that Pjungjang is seriously concerned with the sight of an arsenal, in which the country is likely to see the only possibility of guaranteeing its safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjungjang for the next month to prepare a second drop between Kim and Trump.
fashion shoes in Paris show the latest collections for huge head coverings that will be first available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hot collection or completely shut down the sun, you do not need to search for it anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a palace of crazy head coverings for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Instagrams have been transferred to this summer, and these designers have sent their magnificent creations over the path.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagance coloured hat with a federarted wide edge that just pressed the heads of the models.
As further over-dimensional accessories were shown with juwels, a sugar beet and even an Annan. However, these are not intended to heat the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of strange masks – just right on time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were painted with cut leaves and had more similarities with Hannibal Lecter than with skin Couture.
A creation was similar to a shower equipment, including Schnorchel and shower glasses, while another was like a weeded support.
And if you want to set up a more large fashionable apartment, you're lucky.
Mode monitors predict that the huge head coverings could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional hills follow directly on "La Bomba", the bridge with a width of 60 cm, all from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The cult label behind the extremely infamous hill, which hit large waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the path: a beach bag from the stream, which was almost as big as the model of a bath adder that held the bag.
The bast bag in red orange with bast francs and a white leather ring was the leading piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection “La Riviera” at the Parisian fashion week.
Prominent Stylist Luke Armitage said to F.J.: “I am prepared to have large Heats and beach bags available for the next summer in the shopping streets. The designer has been so excited that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will not be ignored.”
John Edward: Language Knowledge for World Citizens
Scotland's independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This has continued with further outstanding research results in 2018 and is only underpinned by individual and joint achievements in the areas of sport, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools are then represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and want to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As the education sector, which can design a scaled learning plan and implement it, we see that modern languages are still popular and popular in the schools as voters.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only be left in English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
We consider the current results of this year's examination to be the language with the highest attendance rates at the top of the range list of independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages obtained notes A.
From the data above from 74 SCIS member schools, 72% of students in Mandarin obtained notes during the higher exams, 72% of students who learned German, 69% of students who learned French, and 63% of students who learned Spanish also obtained notes A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will be required in the future without doubt.
Today, languages are also seen as election camps, such as STEM (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the educational plans of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17% of the reasons for the problems faced by workers in the possession of open positions were identified in relation to a lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly needed when it comes to preparing young people for their future careers.
Since there is a growing demand for more open languages, these knowledge is indispensable in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a long-term ability.
In order to communicate directly with people from other countries, multi-language people will automatically be given a priori to competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent did not speak enough foreign language to lead a maintenance, and French was spoken as the only language spoken by a double percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is important for children today that we now invest in language education.
Children who speak several languages, in particular the languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland all schools are taught different languages.
A number of schools will focus on classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which will apply with a view to 2020 as the most important for the United Kingdom, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Where your child’s interests are always at the same time, independent schools will always have a number of languages with the appropriate specialized teaching powers to choose.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success as well as always the future.
At this time in a global economic context, it cannot be argued that languages are still as important as the country’s future. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the leader of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers Debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see how LeBron James first appeared for the Los Angeles Lakes, the waiting has soon ended.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will be played on Sunday in the opening game of the preamble against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's gonna play, it's still not fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers Reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play a few minutes.
In the beginning of this week, James was asked after training after his plans for the six games.
"I don't need pre-school games in this phase of my career to prepare me," he said.
Time for Trumps Customer Service in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of elections.
This is the first five of Trumps planned for the next week, including well-being places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the swirling vote on the confirmation of his election for the holiday at the Supreme Court, Trump wanted to build support for the previous half-year notice in November, as the Republican risk was to lose control over the convention.
When does Trumps customer service take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view it online?
Tromps customer accommodation in Wheeling, West Virginia, is planned for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast time).
You can follow Trumps Customer Service in West Virginia below as livestream at YouTube online.
Trump is likely to respond to the hearings of the board of Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court on charges of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in exciting atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains for up to one week in Sweden, while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this competition series is to support Republicans who have to make a difficult choice in November.
As a result, President Trump's election team announced to Reuters that these five customers would serve in the next week to "improve volunteers and supporters while trying to get and build up their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"The control over the Congress is as important to its plans as possible for the President to travel in as many federal states as possible while the active electoral campaign is under way," said a trumpet-fighter, who did not want to name his name, against Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, this evening in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, Wesbanco Arena, which is scheduled for the evening, could be a customer call from "Ohio and Pennsylvania to participate and to report media from Pittsburgh".
The visit on Saturday is a second visit to Trumps this month in West Virginia, the federal state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to support the republian Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
"There is no good sign for Morrisey that the President has to come to try to get him into questioning," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team shows ready to fight to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three consecutive rounds, the four parties on Saturday may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The moving pendel of the moment is as a sport concept, but one that the players really believe, and that is especially in competitions like these.
Where is the moment of her opinion now?
"They put six points in charge, and now there are four, I think that this means a little moment for us," Jordan Spieth said when leaving the game.
Europe is, of course, in favour and it is four points ahead, while twelve further follow.
The Americans, however, say Spieth, have some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing all day and can represent three of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the edge to the green and is a good example.
In the further course of his round, he reduced a key point to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them, after he and Thomas had returned two holes with two points.
His poem, which decided the match on the 15th round for her, solved a similar cry that concludes that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really have to drink and take care of my own game," said Spieth.
That's all the players still have.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the only player in the last two days, have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas and, of course, wrote the history of Ryder Cup.
Europe's unique, but sympathic Duo is at four points and can't make a mistake.
“Moliwood” was not the only couple who had not killed a bogey on Saturday, but they had also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine Sundays on Friday morning Bogeys.
This series and the seemingly between them and the amount of flying energy that they are the players that are going to hit it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who win a possible European victory during the sunset of the sun over Le Golf National.
Predictively, both at the same time on different holes.
However, it would be boring to talk about the European space.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia, the quarter of the morning that played with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spanish and the Swedish into a cage that they could not easily overcome.
But on Sunday no one can help them from the mud.
The four and four pairs are fascinating because of the interaction between the couples, the counsellings they give or do not give, and the way and how a strategy can change quickly, as far as possible.
The Europeans have played a better role as a team and are clearly in command on the last day. However, these four rounds have also shown that the United States team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the United States, have claimed.
Europe goes on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6 in charge
Europe is following the four and four parties from Saturday to the United States at 10:6 and is facing a solid precipitation in the last day of Ryder Cup.
The great playing Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victorys over the difficult Tiger Woods and was able to buy four points in Le Golf National.
The European Mansion introduced by Thomas Björn, who wanted to win the lost trophies in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four American Mansion on the morning against the wrong-doing man and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the United States won more resistance and two matches, however, were unable to halt the return.
Jim Furyks Manschaft needed eight points in the 12th singles played on Sunday to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood won four points as the first European Neuling, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensitive week, won only as a second duo in the history of Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After they had shot Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourths, they were excellently harmonised and hit the detached Woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with a more impressive 57-4.
Woods, who had been hit by two matches on Saturday, allowed his brilliant appearance to appear on the spot, but now 19 of his 29 matches have been lost in four and four parties and seven in follow-up.
Justin Rose, who had retired during the four days of the morning, returned and played the four parties as partners of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the worlds.
For Europe, however, the winter of Paris was not everything in the light of their ideas.
The three-time Major Winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the Messlat for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a so-called 2&1 victory over the John Ram and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-party 4&3, after they lost the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder Cup it was only twice that a team came back after it had gone back to the unit with a break of four points. However, as a title holder, for Furyk's manship, it was enough to keep the trophies.
After only two days in second place, it does not appear as if they could start an attack on Sunday.
North Korea suffers from untrustworthy depravity
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions would violate its mystery against the United States and would never give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the Annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that in the past year, North Korea has taken "good wills of importance". For example, it has stopped nuclear and rocket tests to build the nuclear-testing country and has committed itself to preventing nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we see no appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will never be cut off once."
While Ri's confidence in North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phasing" approach to the denuclearization, in North Korea would be rewarded for successful steps, his statement seemed more significant if it did not prevent a unilateral denuclearization from being preceded by Pjungjang in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement by Kim Young-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12th in Singapore. In this, Kim had promised to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is fighting an official end of the Korean war of 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pjungjang must launch his nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington's claims are rejected after a closure of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is on "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and are even opposed to the "declaration of the war", Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can be imposed on us in the neck is an insult to people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem is, however, that the continued sanctions are covering our mystery."
Ri did not join plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Head of State had highlighted at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
Instead, at three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in in the past five months, the Minister added: "If South Korea were to replace the other party in the question of denuclearization, it would not have been possible to do so when the Korean peninsula was denuclearized."
However, the tone of Ris Rede differed greatly from his speech in the last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was impossible to target North Korea rockets on the United States party after he had named “the bad president” Trump Kim as “raketenmann” on his own suicide mission.
This year, a storm that had threatened North Korea in the last year with the "full destruction" of North Korea, Kim was among the United Nations with praise for his courage in the face of decommissioning steps. However, he said that there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions had to remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
In the middle of the week, Trump said that he had no time frame for it: "If it lasts two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjungjang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued energyly until we have achieved the complete, final and verified denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has strengthened the sanctions against North Korea with a view to financial withdrawal of Pjungjang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri at the border of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjungjang again next month to prepare a second round.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea this year three times, but his last trip was not successful.
In July he said in the April of Pjungjang that progress had been made just to be charged with North Korea hours later, he had made "starting demands".
North Korea agreed to set up this month at a meeting with Moon, a rocket base and an atomic complex when the United States adopted “agreed measures”.
He said Kim had told him that the intended "agreement measures" would be security guarantees provided by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep during this year's basic study. This is a measure against the expanding macho culture to stay awake with coffee and learn all night.
One scientist has found that students at the world-leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention to themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion after the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to call the course into life after he had given a speech on the effects of sleep therapy on the students.
"At last a girl came to me and asked, 'Why did I know about this first, in my last year?'
According to her words, no one had ever told you how important sleep is. That surprised me." he said against The Telegraph.
This year's course first explained to the students how the fundamentals of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve the general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after she had determined that students were under severe sleep conditions during the week.
The single course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee tables, chairs, training shoes and books. They receive information on the effect of coffee and light and the effects of sleep defects on the sport performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleepiness can increase the risk of heart problems, strokes and cancer.
Next, they will be equipped with a map of the university's field with interactive symbols to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the students’ behaviour will not be changed immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – exactly how you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The emphasis on the spreading of a "nighting experience" is still on him, he said and added that modern technologies and the constantly growing pressure on the students made the sleep gap a growing problem.
In order to ensure a good sleep, the “heavy weapons” of all students should be against stress, creation and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, a weight loss was avoided, as sleep loss replaced the brain in the hunger mode, so that they were always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, half Professor Czeisler designed the course. In his first year in Harvard, he had completed a course.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and invited him to attend a university course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study program before they take up their study at the competitive university.
Following the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should take a weekend for sleep and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "Blue Light" that come from electronic screens and LED lightings and can bring the zirkadian rhythm out of the tag. This leads to problems when sleeping.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor wins Gerrards Player
The Rangers lost another outdoor game when the encounter of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrards meant a 0:1 nuance at Livingstone.
The Ibrox men wanted to sell their first appearance since the 4:1-triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added the first second download in 18 games as manager, so his husband returned eight points behind the heart that was leading away in the cargobroke Premiereship.
Many met seven minutes before the half-life, and the inspiration weapons of Rangers seemed to have no chance to compare.
While the rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston ascends to the third place and is only behind Hibernia.
In addition, the Rangers had to be treated by an object that appeared to have been removed from the guest block after the linear direction of Calum Spence.
Gerrard made eight changes to the man, completed the Ayr, and reached the end of the Betfred Cup.
On the contrary, he remained with the same eleven Livingstone players who took off his heart in the last week, and had to be excited about how his well-trained man kept his opponent on step and trip under pressure.
The Rangers did dominate the ball owners, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
After just two minutes, they had to get a door when Mengas first assigned Scott Pittman to Allan McGregors Tor. However, the middle-class player changed his chance and went ahead.
Then a long break from Keaghan Jacobs reached the captain Craig Halket, but his rebirth partner Alan Lithgow was able to pass only on the back foot.
The Rangers took control, but their game was more promising in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was apparently of the opinion that after a quarter-hour meeting between him and Steven Lawless would have received a penalty, but the defendant Steven Thomson failed to apply the charges of the Colombians.
The rangers reached only two torso in the first half, but the former Ibrox-Torhüter Liam Kelly had hardly had difficulties with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a thin shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's encounter in the 34th minute probably didn't mention the game, it is not to lie that they had earned him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not move around with one of Jacobs with a long shot ball in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who held the peace and sought Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted half-time and broke Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the flyer Morelos took position, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game that lies with them, where Lithgow and Halket received a long ball after the other.
Holt's husband would have been able to build her leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and stopped Jacobs before Lithgow took a headball out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Ranger-Amazing Player, also called for a criminal case after a joint with Jacobs, but Thomson saw again.
Almanach: The Founder of the Gegerger
And now a page from our "Sday Morning" Germanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the device known as a resistor.
Since the standard element of science, the geologist has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” with the apparently unusual Cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this in all the world?"
Rogers: “It’s a gas tanker used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “I really hear a kid!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the discovery that bears his name continues to exist.
New cancer can cause the immune system to “see” desired cells
A new cancer can cause the immune system to “see” and destroy the desired cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to identify desired cells within the course of treatment.
In the method, a patient's immune cells are taken, which are changed in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a lot of cancers together and are then re-injected.
A testimonial shows many promising results in patients with various cancers.
The eirstock cancer of a woman who has been treated with the vaccine that causes the immune system to recognize desired cells has been missing for more than 18 months.
In the method, a patient is taken immune cells that are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many types of cancers together with the HER2 protein. The cells are then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results allow us to conclude that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increases the growth of different types of cancers", including breast, eggstock, laryngeal and darm cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, which is taken in patients with immunosuppression cells and is accompanied by these cancer cells, has helped in the treatment of a leukemia.

Kanye West was founded on Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had awarded the United States President Donald Trump and said he wanted to serve as presidential candidate for 2020.
After he had performed his third title of the evening, “Gohost Town” and had carried a makeup American Great Again hat, he continued with a skiing channel against the Democrats and once again stressed his support for Trump.
“I will often be asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He is a racist.’
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started sending a case with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywoodstar made a statement about Brett Kavanaughs before the Senate's Justice Committee to the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the registration of West Schimppitride was not sent, she was uploaded by Commissioner Chris Rock in social media.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about the West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his headache.
“They sent me behind the stage.
They said, ‘Do not go out with the hat’.
You've betrayed me!
And then they say, I was in a missed area," he said to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see the missed area?” He said he will “take my Supermancap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want it to go on with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments were released at least two times from the public, and SNL activists were deeply affected by the activity, reported variation. One person said in the magazine: "It was done in the studio."
West was later entrusted as replacement for the singer Ariana Grande whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was the subject of a talk entitled “I Love It”, when he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, DASS DICH OF THE MASSE INTEGESTELLT HAST.”
However, the Talkshow moderator Karen Hunter tweeted, the West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
"But I want someone who, in my opinion, makes himself a harmful ideology for my community and does not pay for it (for whom I buy his music or his clothes or his art).
He's free.
The same applies to us," she added.
Before sending the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The official beings known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the prince, who died, changed his name in a symbol and then in "The Artist Formly Know As Prince".

"Game of Thrones"-Star Kit Harington attacks toxic humanity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a heavy-duty Jon Snow in HBOs by violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the machohelden. He said that such roles on the screen could have resulted in young people often having to be strong enough to be respected.
In his talk with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed something was done, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic humanity in #MeToo-time.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also engaged in the “Game of Thrones”, also married 31, said that he was “very important” to solve the problem.
"I personally find the question very important at the time, what is wrong with humanity," he said.
"What have we grown up with regard to the problem we have now observed?"
Harington believes that television is responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very male character.
He continued: “What has been born, and what has been learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that young people feel that this particular side of a man has to be torn apart?
I think that is really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change this?
'Cause in the young men, there's clearly something going on."
In addition, he added that after the end of the series in the next summer he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of “Game of Thrones”. He had “a great deal of fighting fields and horses”.
From November, Harington has seen the history of a film producer and his brother, a novelist in Sam Shepards.
The actor recently admitted that for him the best of the game of Thrones was that he had known his wife, Rose.
“I have known my wife for this mission, so I have thus received my future family and life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantastic series Ygrite with numerous emmys, the favorites of Harington's character Jon Snow.
In June 2018, the two married Leslies family members in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the vast majority of the new cases through sexual trafficking.
So far, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost zero, and Chinese health officials attended a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China over the course of the year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalised in 1997 in China, however, the discrimination against LGBT community members should be widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually married women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to insufficient protection against sexual trafficking in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to access HIV medicines, including general access to the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees have been able to secure the data of the GOP senators, criticises "hazardous lies" and "suppression theories"
Maxine Waters, members of the U.S. House of Representatives, argued charges on Saturday, a member of its staff published the personal information from three republican US senators on the Wikipedia side of the agents.
Democrats from Los Angeles believe that the allegations would be spread by “ultra-legal” experts and websites.
"Lives, lies and even more absurd lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information should include the private addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. During the hearing of a Senate Committee on the Supreme Court candidate board, Kavanaugh was published on charges of sexual harassment by an unknown person in the government district.
The release took place after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the contributions has been assigned to Waters’ Office and published information from a member of Waters’ Staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," said Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these false and false accusations, was not responsible for ensuring that the information was transmitted.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly solved criticism online, also by Ari Fleskir, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementia is hot," Fleskir wrote.
“This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the right temperature to be a member of the Congress.
Those who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You mustn't be sad.
You must not question the complainant's motives.
They must be calm and let go."
Fishermen looked like waters’ reaction to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of critics, while the hearing was heated on Thursday.
Also, Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who comes to the semi-trailers to clear water, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and the prosecution authorities of these alleged allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are buried," she continued, "and that they are taken into account for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Critical to "Johnny English – Man only lives three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In the meantime, it is tradition to look for new proof in every British-coloured film for Brexit. This also seems to apply to this repetition of the action environment parochise "Johnny English" which began with "Johnny English – The Spion, which it published" in 2003 and was relived in 2011 with "Johnny English – now just right".
Will an ironic self-parod on the issue of how clearly we are declared to be a new exportance for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glamorous, glimous and incompetence Johnny English was extended to exchange for the second time. His name indicates more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for Chinese visitors in non-English space.
Of course, he is again the busy mysteryman who stands strangely for cool and human beings, while actually from something closeau, a prize Mr. Bean and a bell of this bourgeoisie, which, at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London, has contributed a unique note to the title melody of "The hour of the winner".
In addition, the figure was originally based on the Chaos behind the scenes of returning travelers and international secretaries, who played atkinson in the hidden Barclaycard television stations.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a chopper in a medieval resort and listened briefly to the rotor leaves of his helmet.
Atkinson's application for physical comics has begun, but the Humor seems very weak and rarely overflexible, especially because the "serious" films such as "007" and "mission Impossible" are also offered between self-consolidant elements.
The Humor seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me, Johnny Englishs are not as simple and focused as Atkinson's Stumfilmgags in the role of the bean.
The eternal present premium is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super secret British spy agency, and the identity of all British agents in use, very much for the failure of the service agents, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strike for the Prime Minister, a broken and weighed figure, which is already due to her political dislike before the complete collapse: Emma Thompson has her best character with this Quasi-Teresa May character, but the script does not have much to work with.
Your secret service consultant informs them that all active spyions have been removed and that is why they need to get someone out of the room.
This includes Johny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at a post office, but there is informal teaching in the work as undercover agent. There are a few ways in which English offers a "School of Rock"-removing Spionage Academy.
English will be brought back to a emergency meeting in Whitehall and repeat with his previously severely tested Kampang Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boot commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is something hated.
So Batman and Robin, who are always making a terrible mistake in your Majesty's secret service, are again in action. They meet Olga Kurylenkos of the beautiful Five Fatale Ophelia Bulletin.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister was dangerously involved in the Banan of a charismatic tech milliard, which was played by Jake Lacy by Jason Volta, who claimed to be able to solve the problems of computers in Britain.
English and Bough begin their odyssee of the great fun: As Keller dressed, they wear a modest French restaurant in Brand, they care for Chaos when they move to the board of Voltas luxury, and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to build up himself with a virtual reality headset with the inners of Voltas House.
In this last sequence, however, all registers are taken, but so sympathically and funnyly they are, the issue is already dealt out in the children's television.
Very moderate substance.
As with other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself: “Can the British filmmbarache Rowan Atkinson not have a role to play that will really justify his talent?"
Work is intended to work on a plan, after which the British work four days a week, but they are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labor Party is to consider a radical plan, which foresees that the British work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The Party wants to report that business leaders continue to give savings in the form of an additional free day to the workers by the KI revolution.
The employees would have had a three-day week, but they would still receive the same payment.
Sources follow the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to share the same weight in the country for the benefit of the workers.
The conversion to a four-day week was prompted by the Trade Union Congress (Trades Union Congress) as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A directive is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"A change will not occur at night, but a work week of four days is an attempt to restore the economic balance of workers and the overall industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to promote such an idea. The Green Party has already promised the introduction of a 4-day week campaign during the general election campaign 2017.
However, the approach is currently not fully supported by the Labour Party.
A speaker of the Labour Party said: "At a 4-day week it is not a party policy and it will not be taken into account by the party."
Schatten Chancellor John McDonnell concreteized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profitmakers” in public supply companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water supply companies may not be able to repay their total share, as a labor government could take place due to the relative lack of "reductions".
He also confirmed the relevant plans to appoint employers to the directors of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of private companies’ capital to the employees, who make annual dividends of up to 500 per cent.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy went out in the news magazine “60 minutes”, whether the FBI's investigation could change their opinion in the Kavanaugh case
The FBI's investigation of the claims against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has finalised its appointment to the Supreme Court of Justice for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Republican senators could affect the results of the authorities in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could bring something to date, which might eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I have been informed in the negotiations that I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I then called him, this suspicion was voiced, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was determined, determined and unintended."
But Graham's voice seems to be mixed in stone.
"I think it's true what Brett Kavanaugh is dealing with, and it had to place a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's happened, but I know the following: Brett has fought this hard," said Graham, adding that he was referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone they called could not confirm it."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't make any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was helped to reduce poverty within this festival?
On this same day, in New York, the Global Citizen Festival is taking place to fight the world's poverty every year with an impressive line of stars and an impressive mission.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which takes place this year 7 times, not only to experience the events of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty until 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. Within this project, an international interest group is trying to fight poverty by encouraging more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks. These include activities such as volunteer work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness about the goal of combating poverty.
How successful is the project if you think that Global Citizens are still 12 years old to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of setting a cool free concert, a meaningful opportunity to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clickivism – if you think it is to change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens shared that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011.
These actions should contribute to attracting policymakers around the world, reporting commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group received 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, from which at least 10 billion US dollars have been paid or received by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the security resources have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers with a seat in the United Kingdom, who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million in order to combat land-based malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of subsidization a footnote in history," said the messenger of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also shared that after more than 5,000 actions, with which Britain was called for to improve the food situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project, which would reach 5 million women and children and provide food intervention.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and intense road with heights and depth.
But like the great civil rights and anti-partity movements before us, we will succeed, as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are among the artists who attended this year's event in New York. They are also Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The United States could use the sea for block-out purposes to stop Russian energy exports – Ministry of Internal Affairs
According to Washington Examine, Washington can return to the sea when necessary so that the markets from Russia, including the Middle East, were not reached, shared with US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legal government in these areas.
"I think that the real reason for the use of Russia in the Middle East is the sale of new retail markets in the field of energy, just as in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the staff, there are means and ways to do this.
"The United States, together with the sea, can ensure that the seestrates remain open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he shared.
Zinke joined the participants in the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is understood to be “the voice of the power user” in the United States.
He drew a comparison between the fittings of Washington in relation to Russia and Iran and established that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while referring to Russia as "One Trick Pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the government under trup was about to expand the export of liquidated gas to Europe and to replace Russia with the most cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, the government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" Pipeline Project Nord Stream 2 with the so-called Trump Berlin to "Fengenen" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion US dollars, which is supposed to double the current Pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres to operate an exclusive economic project.
The Kreml argues that the massive resistance of Washington to the project is to be brought back on economic grounds and is an example of unfavourable competition.
"I think we are all thinking that energy should not be used as a means to exercise pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US has received wind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federal Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country joins in our energy supply," said BDI Dieter's board after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants a presidential candidate in 2020 to "examine closely", says the Senator for Massachusetts
The senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check well" a presidential candidate after the election.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, it confirmed that it had a candidate in mind.
According to The Hill, it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, and that includes women at the summit.
Warren plans to "examine closely" a presidential candidate after November 6th.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump had fallen into the wrong direction of this country.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy," she said.
Warren took no note of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, before the vote, an FBI investigation was necessary.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren Elections do not believe that they should apply for 2020.
According to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not apply.
32 percent of the voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 per cent of the potential candidates, and 48 per cent of them.
For the other names of prominent Democrats, which are concerned with a possible candidate for 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, he said he would decide officially by January.
Sarah Palin is on the Donald Trump-Ralley for post-traumatic failure under the track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was a long year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence at the Montagabend.
"What my son does, what he does when he comes back, can catch up with other families who are suffering from the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that return with our soldiers," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as “Elefant in space” and said about her son and other war veterans that they changed their mind that they would come back soon and ask themselves if there was such respect before what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military had given the country.
On Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence to a woman, so Dan Bennett, a speaker of the police department of Vasilla.
18 Federal and D.C. support legal aid for the new asylum policy
18 Federal States and the District of Colombia support legal aid for new US policies to avoid the victims of gang activities or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 Federal States and the District want a court hearing on Friday in Washington to support an asylum tenderer who is involved in politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. session complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy was not announced.
She said that her partner "and his violent gangs" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The statesmen who support Grace named El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations that have serious problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy launched a decision by the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals, which allowed illegal immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The General Bundesan of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy “recognises the decades of legislation at state, federal and international levels”.
"The Federal Law provides that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle," was stated in the judgment of the Court of Justice.
The prosecutors further argued in the statement that the policies which prevent immigrants from accessing the country were adversely affecting the economy in the United States, as immigrants could be more active as entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary labour force.
In June, the General Bundeswanalt Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration attorneys flying against domestic violence and criminal gang violence no longer provide asylum.
"Asyl is available for all who leave their home country because they are persecuted or because they are afraid of racial, religious, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction," said the session in its announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to solve all problems by giving Asyl all the problems, even all the most serious problems people have to face every day around the world.
Double trial in Palu, since the number of deaths in the race has doubled over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very exciting,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, adding her little fiebing son to a rescue center in the town of Palu.
“Every minute a new car comes with death.
Pure drinking water is almost."
The inhabitants returned to their ruined houses to collect their worst wealth and good things and to raise all they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the hospital staff who were damaged by the earthquake with the 7.5 force were completely overloaded.
Some of the victims, including two Hari Haris, who added virbel fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital house of Palu, where patients in the outside world were treated due to the intrusion of a strong strain.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the heavy earth shook the hotel room in the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"All went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he reported the Associated Press, adding that the reason for the stay in the city was a long time.
"I heard the applause of my wife, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
US envoys complain of the Tyrians with "propagandism"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had launched a four-page display in an American daily newspaper, where the opposite benefits of trade between the United States and China were announced, the US envoys in China accused the Head of China of Beijing of using American press for propaganda purposes.
The United States Donald Trump spent the last Wednesday on the paid membership of China Daily in the Mys Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of joining the United States Congress elections on 6 November, a complaint against China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has tried to intervene in the US elections are consistent with the message of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of a scaling campaign, released by Washington to operate printing on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn off advertising for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently being developed in an emergency trade war, with duties on imports for both countries.
In the beginning of the trade war, Chinese exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassadors in China and former former Governor of Iowa, who exported large amounts of agricultural products to China, reported that Beijing was injured by workers, owners of agricultural companies and companies.
China, such a brand city in a position in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles these Tyrannes by launching propaganda messages in their own free press in the United States.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government demands the tradition of free expression and independent press in America by shutting down the country's advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, you will find only in a limited number of votes in Beijing on the news discs and do not find any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese could have about the disturbing economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China.”
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his articles. However, he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republican voters announced the election with the Debakel around Kavanaugh, warning observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of more charges of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the previous exchanges that might arise in particular from women.
The vote in this connection was extremely encouraging, and most Republicans have already announced that they will continue with a vote.
“These things can’t be undone,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last minute advance of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be sufficient for an FBI investigation to deal with disappointed voters.
“Don’t forget what happened yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and not even in November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn, so the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called on the Senate's "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, decided to remain on the nomination of Kavanaughs, and despite the statements of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
Democratic entertainment and motivation were an extremely important topic, shared by Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially with voters in the prefer countries and with younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they do not like the presidents, often do not choose."
Even before the public statement of Fords, in which their allegations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court were detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans submitted the confirmation.
“This situation is a serious obstacle to the GOP”, said former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, Michael Steele.
"It is not only about the vote of the panel, the final vote or the review of the Kavanaughs; it is also about the way and way in which the Republicans have acted and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats with the press channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be the least to believe, because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, where they have a slightly larger share on the latter side.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were convinced definitively or probably by Ford’s statement, while 35% claimed that they gave Kavanaugh beliefs definitively or probably.
Furthermore, 38 % indicated that they felt that Kavanaugh had probably lied or definitively in his statement, while 30 % said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an empty statement last week before the Senate's Justice Committee that she was attacked at the age of 17 by the drunk Kavanaugh.
Ramirez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court had disclosed his genius to her when she was at a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The Founder of the World Wide Web plans the launch of a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the discoverer of the World Wide Web, is currently bringing a launch on the market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology-enhancing, inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who accesss the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made it best that the intention behind the inrupt is the "welterrschaft".
"We must be active now," he said on the issue of startup.
"It's about a historic moment."
The app introduces the technology of Solid so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and business sector.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all content in a browser is available at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user can decide only who can access the data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea behind the inside is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate capabilities so that solid is available for all.
The company currently belongs to Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up to work on this project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee explained that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google if a comprehensive change is to be made when their entire business models are completely redesigned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a media contribution published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee provided for a redesign of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has been involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident of what this new era of the web requires," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, heir of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was respected
The only spiritualist of the Church of England, who was distinguished as a fighter with the Victorian cross during World War I, was respected 100 years later in his hometown.
Oberstleutant and Priest Bernard Vann won the nomination due to his involvement in the attack on Bellenglish and Lehacourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a shield guard and never learned that he had won the highest British war registration.
His two grandsons buried a monument on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the singles, Michael Vann, felt that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memory stone was buried almost 100 years after the Heldentat, for which his grandfather was honored.
According to The London Magazine, Colonel Vann led his batallon over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918; through the dark nebel and under heavy decision of field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he moved forward to the fire line and led the line with the “greatest defeat” before he launched a single-armed attack and three military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German shield guard on October 4, 1918; something more than a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the deeds of his grandfather were something he could never be judged, and at the same time something that would make a dismal.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid a branch down in the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very ashamed to be able to participate in the parade and added that the loss of a real hero would be particularly visible through the support of many people.
MMA fans have been awake all night to see Bellator 206 instead, there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been awake all night to see a exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The account of San Jose included 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and was thrown alive all night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
About 6 hours later, just as Gheard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the visitors in the United Kingdom were not as bad as suddenly seen Peppa Pig.
Some remain unattended after they have been awake until early morning to see the fight in particular.
A fan described the change to the trick film figure as a kind of bad joke on Twitter.
"For the purpose of a regime by the government, these contents will be replaced as not a youth-free, so they must be transferred to a child-sustainment within 6 hours," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication with Bellator, when he was asked about the transfer.
"Pappa, the woman, exactly."
The company's board at Bellator, Scott Cooker, announced that the company will be processing the run-up plan to take into account visitors from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think the problem could already be solved in the game of repetition," he said.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday with visitors in the United Kingdom, and we won't solve the situation until Sunday our time, Monday place time.
But we'll stay in the woods.
The change has been quite very communicated. It went pretty well together and it wasn't always everything.
We have tried to solve the problem and have concluded that it is a technical breach.
What wasn't the case, it was a problem from the government.
I promise, that won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the whole of 5 instead of 6 battles, as usual. And we've tried to offer the fan the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite sad."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels about sexuality "underground"
Tom Daley, who has participated as a water runner in various Olympic games, says he is up with the feeling of being subjected to all others because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old felt that he had only realized at the continuing school that he was different than others.
In the first radio 4 desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne said he had spoken about school rights to encourage others.
He also meant that since he became a father, the winners in the Olympic games are no longer so important to him.
The real moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, is suffering from illness for a few months.
In his first letter to Laverne, he said that he considered himself less than others, since the love of boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: “To this day, the feeling is to be inferior to others and to be different than the others, the reason for my power and strength and finally for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person to impress no one when his sexual orientation was known.
The two-fold bronze medal winner in the Olympics today is a prominent LGBT activist and used his approach to this year's Commonpeace Games in Australia to prevent the decriminating of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he was referring to this subject because he was happy that he could live without restrictions and without discrimination and want to make other courage.
The three-time world champion loved the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The discovery of being loved in a man was an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married Oscar-winner 20 years ago, but he told him that the age difference had never been a topic.
He believes that if you had to spend as much as a child and young people as you would – he took 14 to the Olympics for the first time and his father died three years later on cancer, it is difficult to find someone in the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have had a son who bears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley thinks that his whole way of looking has changed since.
In the last year, he had been traveling with everything about gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic Gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main target.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his diagnosis.
Daley said his father didn't accept the next death, and one of the last things he asked was the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be with it all the time.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and then it finally became clear to me that he's not invisible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal in the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I just knew that it was always my dream to get baptized in Olympic games before the domestic public – that was the journey," he said.
His first favorite choice – Heather Small's Proud – was also influenced. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and was still looking after Gänsehut.

Mickelson, who is not currently in shape, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47. Ryder Cup game, but he has to work very hard so that it doesn't become a debacle.
Mickelson, who played the event 12 times, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday to the replacement bank.
Instead of being more at the center of the event, the five Majors spent their day trying to fire others and work at his game in the hope of overcoming the problems that plague him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the direct golfer and therefore no ideal crew for the fine Le Golf National golf course, where missing balls are regularly punished.
And if the place itself had not been discouraged enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, meets the perfect British Open Championship Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, Neuling at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points of retreat at the 12 single games have a hot start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely decisive.
Furyk probably went out to Mikkelson and couldn't add much to it either.
"He was completely about his present role in the streets, gave me a cup of water on my back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has quite a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world's famous personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had more idea, but that's how it's run now, and that's what we've been waiting for.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most of the Ryder Cup games that were released on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race, which would never fully address the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 winnings, 20 downloads had to be hidden and reached seven semi-times, although Furyk told that his presence had already reached the team alone.
"He's funny and serkastic, original and wants to make some fun, and he's a great man who's liked the whole team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were glad to get to know him this week, and it was fun to see them.
He's a really interesting person who has many impulses."
Captain Thomas Björn knows that it can be over with the premier soon
Thomas Björn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great premise that leads to the last single games in Ryder Cup can quickly become an unknown situation.
The déné was debursed in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team introduced by Seven Ballesteros had a premier of five points against the Americans, but only recently came over the target and led with the least possible advance and achieved a victory of 1411⁄2–131/2.
"The thought remains that we had a great spring in Valderrama, we had a great spring in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we had won, but it was only a small one," said Björn (on the photo), after he had seen the win 5-3 of the 2018 class both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow's the right thing to do.
Put yourself in the witness and do the right thing.
The whole thing is over when the points are on the display table.
We want to win these trophys, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said it, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're completely aware of what is happening to us on the other side: the best players in the world."
asked Bjorn about the performance that his players had performed on a difficult golf course: “I would never overrun it.
Tomorrow is another caliber.
Tomorrow's the details are in the background and that's a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're alone out there, then you're tested to the limit of your abilities as a golfer.
You have to make it clear to the players that tomorrow's the best out of you.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Björn, his opponent Jim Furyk will note that his players are better off than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on the two sides of the main road on the last turn of the day. He stood in Brooklyn on the winning side before following Europe’s “Wunder of Medina” on the side of the losers.
"I remember every damn word," he answered to the question like Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, his players were motivated before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the fast start you have seen in Brooklyn and in Medinah.
When the moment falls into a direction, it puts the medium games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to cook tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task to overcome the opposition, he had to take part in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Frame, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as more European than half of the rank list.
"I have chosen for the boys in this series because I think it's all covered," said Bjorn about his choice for the single encounters.
Germany's new warship is again delayed
The latest fleets of the German Marines should have been put in service in 2014 to replace warships coming in the years from the cold war. However, they will be delivered through local media because of faulty systems and rapid growth costs only next year.
The introduction of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leadship of the new "Baden-Württemberg" class, was now transferred to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have been in service in 2014 but the ambitious project was subject to disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, already ordered by the Marine in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-Class.
They should contain a useful cannon, a series of flight gears and seaplanes as well as tartechnologies such as a reduced radar, infrarot and acoustic flux.
Another important feature is longer waiting periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their homes for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays can lead to the fact that the highly modern warships that Germany is supposed to represent as a seamstress are already renewed at the time of its entry into operation, such as the time.
The F125 frigate followed by the accident was released last year in the ranks when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to Hamburg by the Werft Bloom & Voss.
That was the first time that the Marine returned a ship after its delivery to the ship.
It was little known about the reasons for the return, however, German media called a series of significant "software and hardware defects", which had made the new ship useless in a fight situation.
Software problems are particularly difficult, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be occupied by only 120 matrozens, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen-Class.
It was also known that the ship is too difficult, which leads to performance gains and prevents marines from carrying out future resurrection measures.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in the second world war.
In addition to the misappropriated hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the holding, have also been a problem.
The costs appear to rise to an estimated €3.1 billion, compared with the originally foreseen €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in view of the latest warnings that the Semacht Germany is breaking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartel, the German Federal Air Force Commander, confirmed that the sea “is going out of the useful ships”.
Bartels said that the problem became bigger with time, since old ships were taken out of service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He argued that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the sea.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Flyder Mouse
In an presence in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are being carried out to show how Fledermusee uses the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future natural protection activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will be conducted in the Inverwe Garden in West Ross, as well as in the Brown Langoh and Waterflyms.
Special recording devices shall be placed at key positions on the ground to record the activities of the flyer Mouse during the entire season.
NHS employees and volunteers are also conducting mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In the case of a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the flocking call is determined and identified which species do what.
Next, a map and a report of the living room will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at rural level.
Rob Dewar, a natural protection consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will be shown which areas of the living room are the most important for the flag mouse and how these are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of the measures to manage the living room, such as the creation of Wiesen, and to show how to obtain forest areas for river mussels and other related species.
The Flederma stocks in Scotland and the entire United Kingdom have been significantly removed in the last century.
They will be threatened by construction and development works that affect themselves on sleeping places and lead to the loss of the living room.
Windmills and lighting can also present a risk, as well as air carriers and the chemical treatment of construction materials or also attacks by household cats.
Flyermuses aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching bees.
They use an out-of-ocorbed escort to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the subject of the fleet museum very seriously.
It has over 10 trained experts carrying out regular investigations, inspections of sleeping sites and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only fleet maus reserve in the Treve estates in Dumfries and Galloway, the home of eight of Scotland's 10 fleet species.
Good manager David Thompson explains that the existence of the ideal living room for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a great area for Fledermuse," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living room.
But there are many things we still don't know about Fleder Mouse, so we're going to do these work here and to other good people who will help us learn more about what Fledermese need to feel better."
He stressed how important it is to exclude from the presence of foot-and-mouth disease prior to maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unfavourable destruction of a single nesting area could kill up to 400 females and young animals and remove the entire population from place to place.
Flyermuses are protected and it is illegal to kill them, kill them or destroy their places of descent relatively.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
She explains: “We still have to learn a lot about Fledermuseum, and we don’t know how it is about our populations in many of our species."
Ronaldo seeks enforcement, while his lawyers want to accuse the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo referred to him as “Fake News” and said that people would want to be “promoted” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to accuse the news magazine The mirror who published the charges.
The director of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was charged with the rape of an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he paid her next $375.000 to buy her sweater at the event, so the mirror was on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video on its 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo reported the reports only hours after their release as "Fake News."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the fifth winner of the Ballon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player slowly.
Ronaldo's attorneys are prepared to condemn the mirror because of the charges they refer to as "unreliable reporting of suspects in the area of privacy".
Professor Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a set of damages for “moral damage in a height corresponding to the severity of the violation of law, which may represent one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The event is expected to take place in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they had met in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's room, where he reportedly filed them at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the bone after the alleged incident and said that he was “99% a good kernel”, which was responsible for the “one percent”.
In the documents it is claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it had been acceptable.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later she joined an extrajudicial agreement, since she had “agst before compensation” and was careful to be“publicly relieved”.
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to raise the agreement, since she was still traumatized because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about the time of the alleged incident to change from Manchester United to Real Madrid and changed this summer into a 100 million heavy deal to Italian rice Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘suppose the loss of car manufacturers’
The United Kingdom would be "very happy" if after Brexit it lost its status as a world-leading manufacturer of cars, so Minister of Economy Greg Clark said.
He further said that it was "occurred" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would interrupt production in the work in Burnaston at Derby, the UK should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer pointed out that the influence of delays on the border could lead to the loss of jobs at no-deal brexitis.
The work in Burnaston, produced in Toyotas product line Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience in our work an uncontrollable Brexit End of March production stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotas Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also allowed concerns about a strong EU outflow without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-work in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns depend on the car manufacturers with risks within the delivery chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyotas production plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that parts are delivered from both the United Kingdom and the EU in order to complete the cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could result in interruptions, which could lead to delays and failure in the participation of the industry.
It is impossible for Toyota to conduct a storage stock in Derbyshire, which lasted longer than a day, explained why the company had to interrupt production.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers Plan on the future relationship with the EU is "expected to avoid such border controls".
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that has enabled us, as I have already said, to enjoy not only the current success, but also this chance to get it,” he explained in today’s BBC Radio 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long the production had to be interrupted, but warned long-term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and ultimately lead to loss of employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and has been the chief executive of the Union industry, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience will never come back if they are first away.
One speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trumps planned meetings with Rosenstein could be relocated according to information of the White House
Donald Trumps, an important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, could be moved “for another week” during the contest for the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued on Sunday from the White House.
Rosenstein has been monitoring the work of Special Mediar Robert Mueller, who has examined the wave mix through Russia, links between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as possible judicial interference by the presidents.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Minister of Justice and thereby endanger Mueller's independence had been the subject of crimes in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was responsible for the possibility of registering his talk with Trump as well as the president's appointment with the 25th Act.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his unusual return.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was present at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump explained that he would not prefer to leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to prevent it from collating with the hearing before the U.S. Senate justice committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had caused him sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trup ordered a weekly FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trumps Press Speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
On a question of meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for this; it may be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be moved another week, in view of all the things just going with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press on the run."
Some reporters would object to this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences did not lie against the TV reporter's "Effect Cases", but said, "I would not hesitate to do so."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would take place.
The President made more questions and replies rounds than any President before him," she explained, without any clear evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
Press conferences will still be given, however, as Sanders said, “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, but much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have often done it in the last few weeks. This will take place at the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions if he leaves the white house or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with him are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he drew up a series of reporters who were running out of the wheel and who had a rather strange attitude.
Health Minister writes for Brexit's concerns to EU workers in the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health shall apply to persons from the EU-Ausland, who are working in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS), to express the country's gratitude and to express their desire to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before leaving the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
Freeman wrote in your letter: “During the summer, the foreign negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued and decisions will be expected to take place.
However, the British Government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know what exciting times this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I am contributing to each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Fellows and colleagues from all over the EU and in addition bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full and full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to a headache of notation
The Linebacker of the Tennesese State of Tigers Christion Abercrombie was reported by Mike Organ of Tennessee State after a head injury, which he added on Saturday at the 31-27 low station against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the chief of Tennesse State, told reporters that the damage arrived shortly before the half-hour break.
"He came to the page line and just broke up there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel provided abercrombie on the side line with oxygen before being placed on a track and transported for further tests.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no more details of the nature or extent of the damage" have been known and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage has occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after he changed it from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded 5 tickets, thereby increasing his total number in the season to 18 tickets.
Foreign investors must pay higher stamp taxes for real estate purchases in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom in the future.
This step should influence the success of Jeremy Corbys campaign on young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will concern all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance estimates that up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless
Theresa May will be announced today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, where the interest rates are to be paid.
This step is an attempt to achieve Jeremy Corbyns success in young voters, who are promised to provide more comfortable living space and to take top-values into the audience.
The increase in stamp taxes will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase in double housing and rent-free housing, the increase could be estimated by up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance is calculated by step with an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13% of newly built real estates in London are purchased by investors who are not in the United Kingdom. This brings prices to the top and it will be harder for first-time buyers to take on real estate.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, were given the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom to “Geist cities”.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke for a reduction of stamp taxes in order to allow more young people to have their first own home.
He charged the construction company to maintain the real estate prices by buying the country without using it, and theresa May urged to set up quotas on affordable housing to end the British 'dwelling'."
The opposition leader Corbyn announced a series of proposals for housing reforms, which ranged from a rental price link to a ban on space without a noticeable reason.
He also wanted to build more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May explained: “Last year, I said that I would be referring to my time as prime minister of the restoration of the British dream, according to which life of generation to generation should be improved.
And that's to repair our purchased housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be true that for people who do not live in Britain, as well as for companies living abroad, it is so easy to buy real estate, such as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of owning has become too far away for many people, and the inequity of ignorance continues to be a big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of the Sunderland, says that it is his “largest goal” to become the management of the Scottish team at any time.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of introducing the unity of the North East England, which is just on the third place in the League One and missing the three points.
He took this summer to the stadium of Light after he led St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I created it on the bank and it was," said Ross of BBC Scotland's send-on sports Sound.
“But as a child, I have often seen Scotland playing with my father in Hampden, and this is something that always bothers me.
However, this opportunity would only come if I were successful in joint management."
Ross ancestors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Doc Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic suggested that there should be no fear of entering such established names at such a club after he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment if I can return the union to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and opportunities in this union, he is no doubt a member of the Premier League," he explained.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'd probably appreciate my time here only as a success if I bring the union back there."
Ross can present a first three-year management career, after a phase as a deputy chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month-old work as a trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa get from the relegation into the third League and left St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the mastership in the following season.
Ross says he now feels happier than before in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It must have been a real tragedy," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Allia.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny because I didn't have a bad job, I was able to live well and experienced some very pleasant high-schools.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still do this because of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I've done it. I've never felt like I've been in my skin all my life."

The perfect time for a glass beer is 5:30 a.m., so a study
The summer heat change has replaced the adoption of the British crisis pubs, while restaurants chained under larger pressure.
In July, public and private companies accounted for an increase of 2.7 percent. The revenues at the restaurants were estimated to be 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA’s company council, which compiled the figures, explained: “The content of Sunshine and England longer than expected to take part in the football club meant that July followed a similar pattern as in previous June, in which the Pubs could record 2.8% increase in consumption.
The decline of 1.8 per cent, registered by the restaurant industry in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars with emphasis on drinks gradually showed the best performance, with a flat-down marketing development that increased higher than they were at the restaurants.
Pubs focused on food in the sun too, but not as drastic as the restaurant operator.
It looks like the people wanted to go out on a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, the drinking rates in the month rose by 6.6 per cent, while the percentage of food rose by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, one of the analysts for RSM's leisure and hospitality projects, explained: “These results continue to indicate the trend we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but sales volumes of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful compared with the previous year.
The long, hot summer would have been no worse for business operators with a focus on food, and it remains to be expected that the more suitable temperatures in August will be delivered the urgently needed atmosphere."
The overall sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including the openings, was 2.7% in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.

One of five children owns hidden accounts in social media, hiding it from their parents
A study shows that every five children, sometimes just 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that keep them secret before parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in continuing schools has shown an increase in the so-called "Fake Insta" pages.
The message assures us that sexual contents are mailed
Twenty percent of the students offered to own a “main account” to show their parents
One of five children, sometimes only 11 years of age, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret before adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in continuing schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a loan to the photo sharing website Instagram.
The message cautions most that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students offered to have a clean "main account" that they can show their parents, but also to have private accounts.
A mother who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who others urged “to persuade me.”
The study conducted by Digital Avaress UK and Headmasters’ and Headmasters’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of which they had access to private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, explained: “It is devastating that so many teenagers are being trained to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilyh Doyle will "voice of the Athletics" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilyh Doyle was elected to this annual General Assembly as an non-executive member in the Scottish Leichtahletiks Dachverbands Scottish Athletics Council.
Doyle described the choice as a great opportunity for athletes to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilid will be respected in the Scottish, British and World League and we are sure that the Latvians in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am happy to act as the voice of the athletes and hope that I will make a real contribution and be able to lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won over 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, called his own four Olympic gold medals, and today often turns out as BBC experts, was no longer able to run after a previous blood loss.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say that no one can tell if or how far I'm going to go.
It was hard work, but I have been fully recovered, have learned to run again and make mobility exercises today!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news!"
A release for milk pumps, which compares mothers to cows, ensures in the heating network
A manufacturer of milk pumps made the network with a werbeclip, in which the stimulant mother is compared to the milk of cows.
In the introduction of the so-called "first-fashioned milk pump" on the market, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie has published a very serious shared music video to emphasize the freedom that the pumps provide for.
Four real moms dance in a song filled with flowers in the background of a song containing texts such as: “Yes, I’m milking, but you don’t see any shame on me” or “if you haven’t noticed that these are not yours, but my breasts.”
In the Refrain it continues: “Pup it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the publication published on the company's Facebook page has solved a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video was based on mixed reactions in visitors, many of whom say that it is unharmed by the "screcks" of the milk industry.
"It was a very bad decision to buy this product with cookies.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and bear a calb to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within a few days after birth," it said in a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits in a steel-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment said: “Superious traumatized for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to buy a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "So a real-time advertising."
Others defended the advertising and gave a woman that you found the song “urcomic”.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would've bought one if I'd still be quiet.
I felt like a bitch when I was pumping.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to interpret it.
This is a great product," wrote a person.
Another person commented: “This is a major advertising aimed at mother, using milk pumps (e.g. at work or on toilets) and feeling like “kie”.
This is no advertising for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that all had dancing with the discreet pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps give themselves to feel like milk cows.
The pump of Elvie, however, is completely out of reach, has no noise or noise and fits discreetly in a styl-BH, whereby women get the freedom to move to hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother, explained: “The pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a waiting and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with milk cows, we wanted to return milk pumps and all the obstacles that would arise in the middle and at the same time present the incredible feeling of freedom, which enables the new pump.
That's not the first time that Elvie's pump fell into the loops.
During the London Fashion Week a double mother appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski on the catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were stopped and taken to a city in a coastal city at the Mexican border
The number of internally displaced children is as high as ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively similar, including that of forced rhetoric and the measures of the Trump government have made it harder to bring children under care.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers were themselves illegal immigrants and are now afraid of becoming the target for a divorce when they sign up to adopt a child.
In June, the risk was announced as federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household had to print their fingerprints and that these data were shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Customs Administration Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before the Congress that the authorities arrested thousands of people who had been charged with the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrestees had no previous entry into the criminal register.
“At least 80 per cent of persons who are either a manager or a member of a manager’s household are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to follow these people," Albence explained.
In order to be able to process the cases of children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules that called for staff of the accommodation in some children to appear within 60 days of the detention before the court, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video activation and not personally to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
When negative decisions are made, the person will be released quickly.
As long as these children remain in danger, this is more likely to be reported by the accommodation workers as well as reports that they have been known in the last month from the system to be imprisoned and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or explosions.
Defenders say that these concerns will be strengthened at a larger facility such as Tornillo, since there are signs that a child has problems, due to the size of the child, will be seen more easily.
They also explained that traumatata, where many of the children are already suffering, can be strengthened if they are brought to a city of destination without emotional preparation or enough time to engage with friends.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish 'assistance forces' to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulalem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, although the civil war in the country was still in the eighth year.
Moulalem, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign fighting forces, with the advance of the fight against terrorism, were illegal on Syrian soils and were “to be treated accordingly”.
"They must return immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the assembly.
Moulalem claimed that the “war against terror is almost over” was in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus “will continue to fight this holy battle until all the Syrian territories are safe” both by terrorist groups and by “all illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has stationed around 2000 soldiers in Syria, training and counseling both mostly Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 underground calls in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moulalem explained that the conditions for their return were given and he charged “some Western countries” to “send inexhaustional obstacles” the refugees to leave home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable homelessness," he explained.
"They actually policy a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid would be granted for Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebellionhochburg Idlib represents the opportunity for political talks to be held.
The division between Russia and Turkey turned out to be a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian fighting forces supported by Russia to the province, where three million people live.
Moulalem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military measures against the disschahadists, including the fight against the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, will be "removed".
UN Deputy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to invite the first meetings of a new committee to be composed of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and to choose the way.
Moulalem announced the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and explained that its work should be limited to the "recasting of the article of the current Constitution" and was expected to be withdrawn.
Why Trump is winning his election
With this logic, Trump would win its re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal observers might hope, a formal hearing or a scandal will pre-empt its presidency.
This would certainly be “the most dramatic final of a presidency of all time”.
So far, there are no signs that it had been set by the visitors.
Since 2014, the number of individual allowances for the best delivery time at CNN has doubled to 1.05 million and nearly 1.6 million for MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million visitors to the best time of delivery, compared to 1.7 million years ago. MSNBCs “The Rachel Maddow Show” introduced the unique rates with an estimated 3.5 million visitors to the Abenden with important news.
"It's like a fire that people use magically, because it's about something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series "Designed Survivor" on the ABC TV transmitter, which will be the president after an attack on the capital.
Nell Scowell, an ancient comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" has another theory.
It remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told you he'd choose a tramp.
She asked him for the reason.
"He said, 'because he brought me to the lake'" told me Scowell.
Chaos has maintenance value.
Of course, the stories from Washington, in contrast to everything on the television, can determine the future of the basic decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible integration of families and the health of the global economy.
The turnout is a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the most privileged visitors.
And yet there is going to be an informed citizen, if one is aware that already six hours of expert rounds have been used by Bob Woodwards to use sources from the so-called “Fair”, Paul Manaforts $15,000 beloved Bomberjacke from Straußenleader (called Washington Post) or the effects of Stormy Daniel's travel description of Trump, hmm, are discussed by Anatomy.
For my part, I'll never see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
"A part of what he does can feel like a reality show that he's making every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief business leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the series "The Three From the Pfandhaus", about rotating crews and daily actions (a fight with the football League NFL from the Zaun, Kim Jong-un prizes).
You can't make it happen, or you can't come with it anymore.
When I arrived this week, it was just 27 degrees ahead of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he stepped in and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn't get out of the screen, not if Judge's candidate Brett Kavanaugh was a short time ahead of the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court of Justice was in the game.

Voluntary donations of money may also be sent directly to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.
It is little surprising that the 17th election area of Pennsylvania will be transferred from money, thanks to the renewed limits of the electoral region, which led to two officials sitting on the race.
The newly designated Prestadt district in Pittsburgh is allowed to represent the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another region in the course of a special election last spring.
Lamb attacks another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently taking over the old 12 district of Pennsylvania, which is very close to the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of the state of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas were extended against the Constitution and were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district opened an exchange of election campaign funding between the major financial forces of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a multi-skilled special election in March about the 18th election region of the state.
This sitting was held by a Republican over a decade and Trump won 20 percentage points in advance.
Politeexperts provide the Democrats with an easy guide.
The United States examines El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Peking had already been recognized without having to stand out in Washington, D.C.
Trump graduated in June 2017 from a friendly meeting with President Panamas Juan Carlos Valero and hosted a hotel in Panama to partner the management team of the Trump organization.
Officials of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the leaders of all American foreign affairs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the latest decisions, Taiwan no longer recognises”, so Heather Nauert, the Minister's speaker in a position at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, a penalty measure estimated at 140 million dollars in 2017 was considered, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed criminal measures, including reductions in financial aid services and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murders.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials will move a high-level conference on security and economic well-being that should follow up on a similar meeting in the past year and take a step forward in the efforts to keep migrants away from it towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and concluded with such effect that the review of measures for El Salvador was considered effective.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a speaker at the conference held in mid-October to set out a sign of the importance of the conference's government.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silent and free to return to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new broken messages or criminal action from Washington.
A government speaker from John Bolton drew an opinion on the details of the debate, which was described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who, under the terms of anonymity, were willing to express themselves to the internal discussions.
Her views were confirmed by a government close to existing external analysts, who also spoke under the terms of anonymousity.
Learn From History
The next great surprise could be the report of Special Rapporteur Robert Mueller on possible judicial interference, for which there is now sufficient positions in the public.
Mueller is now apparently also investigating whether the Tromps team has been conceived by Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the convention majority should change, see Trump confronting an organ that binds him to account and that is exactly the time when he prepares to meet again before the voters; and, if possible, before a vote.
These are many 'Wens' and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trumps, or his European pendant, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had just been opposed to him and the Czechs in Munich had supported him.
We have failed, and we have missed an opportunity to avoid the years of Barbarianism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points and the endless march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just standing in front of more of these turning points.
What do we do when Trump leaves the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, so the man who decides about the future of Muellers?
Rosenstein has been in Teufel's kitchen since this press last year reported that he proposed to register the presidents secretly and speculated about them, but was inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein demarcates the exhibition of New York Times.
“How will we answer if the newly commissioned FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed in the office despite religious charges of sexual abuse and misappropriation?
And above all, are we going to vote in the exchange elections for a convention that is binding on the press?
If we fail these tests, we have a longer winter ahead of us.
But I think we're not going to lie because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz, although the same regime that had once occupied my mission home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to relax on the table with the shark cross.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistically before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remiss against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will be replaced by a good position for the Qualification of the Group G of Europe League.
Due to a kidney injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear to be equal to 2-2 against Villareal, but he believes that the ranges of this result can be used as a jumpboard for larger.
"That was an important point for us, since Villareal is very good," says the 31st year.
We went with the conviction in the game that we could do something about it and we were headed home with a point.
Maybe we could still win at the end, but in the end, it was probably a good result.
They may have dominated in the first half, but we have reached the second half and were then the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a difficult part, since they have achieved a good outcome in the last game. But I am sure that we can go through it with the public behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of welfare factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward to the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of ageing care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants in the survey knew exactly how to handle them, only a few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide study offered to talk to your partners about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent offered to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Security Party.
That's why you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family for it if you don't express your wishes at the right time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be dealt with, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisers to board: Your consultant can also help you find an opportunity to finance these expenditure.
Your long-term financial decisions may include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-like life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Use legal disputes in the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you are appointed by a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that the health authorities comply with your wishes should be able to express themselves.
Consider also a full power for your finances.
You select a trusted person who is facing financial decisions and ensures that your accounts are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Suppose your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about taking medication or allergies?
Please note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Men in Ilfracombe several times threatened with air pollution
A man was attacked several times by an air threat when he went to work with friends at home.
The victim, a man in the four-year-olds, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the bow and the hand.
Officials describe the shields that reached about 02:30 in British time as “willful act”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police were looking for witnesses.
Lands and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, so the authorities. The number of deaths should still rise.
Due to the lack of communication systems, aid forces were not able to obtain information from the government district of Donghea, a region north of Palu, located near the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donghia on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami arrived.
Donghea is a government area located in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi over a coastal area of over 300 km (180 miles) long.
In the government area, a administrative unit under the province, lived with a value of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of the Central Sulawesis economy, in particular the coastal region Donghea.
The Nickelbau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morovali, the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Donghea have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s disaster protection authorities.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami, which destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghea.
In 1996 a tsunami hit the West Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Firering, and is regularly searched for by Earth.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake at the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, occurred on 26 December, leaving a tsunami that struck 14 countries and cost nearly half the lives of 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes devastated the West Coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people die on the Neas islands before the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with the strength of 6.8 struck the southern Javas, Indonesia's most popular island and wiped out a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed almost 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength of 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands before Sumatra and wiped out a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed 300 lives.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the government area Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, Tsunami was not released, but more than 100 people were killed by one-stop building.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, which was popular in tourists, and called for more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The bebes destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily scattered on the island.
Sarah Palins' son has been convicted of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor Alaska and former candidates for the office of the vice-president, was arrested for the purpose of body damage.
The 29-year-old Palin from Vasilla, Alaska, was found to be a report published by the Alaska police on Saturday, due to the suspicion of domestic violence, the prevention of domestic violence and opposition.
According to the police report, he took off his phone when they wanted to understand the police.
Palin is located according to KTUU in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility, and it has been purchased at 500 dollars.
He appeared on the Saturday before the court where he, when asked for his file, was answered with “not guilty, absolutely sure” such a network.
Palin is accused of having three orders in Class A, which can be punished up to a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He will also be placed in charge of the Class B orderliness, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time we've been attacked against Palin.
In December 2017 he was asked to have his father arrested Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case will be dealt with in advance of the Veteran's court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was subjected to domestic violence, the prevention of the notification of a crime and the possession of weapons under the influence of torture.
His friend warned him to shoot you in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by Veterans' organizations after they returned her son to a post-traumatic abuse disorder due to his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after birth in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people die after a earthquake that the Indonesian island of Sulawesi crashed on Friday.
The beaver with a strength of 7.5 dissolved a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks are broken down and the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The ground floor is just ahead of the coast of Central Sulawesis, located in northeastern Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos from the time of the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal government demands executions for suspects in New York's terrorist organization
The federal government in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who was charged with the terrorist attacks in New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state since 1953 for a federal offence.
The 30-year-old Saipov is charged with using a rented pick-up from the construction chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, during which he raced on a road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and transported on footmen and passengers in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the complainants must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “targeted” and “consciously” of severe physical injuries, as stated in the intentional statement for the death penalty requirement in the southern region of New York.
Both complaints could, according to the court document, be punished with death.
Weeks after the appeal, a Federal Court of Investigation presented a complaint in 22 points covering eight charges of murder in the background of organised crime, which are normally used by federal courts in cases of organised crime, as well as a complaint against the use of force and destruction of vehicles.
The approach requires "the basic planning and premise", so the complainants described the type of action carried out in the Saipov as "abstaining, grunting and losing".
“Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco Schaden, pain and loss”, the statement said.
In five victims, it was about Argentinan tourists.
For over a decade, the southern region of New York has not followed a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was executed in New York in 1953 was in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union.
On June 19, 1953, both Rosenbergs were set up with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed in the days and months following the arrest of missing kings, such judicial statements.
He told the investigators how he felt about what he had done.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired by the fact that after watching ISIS's videos on his phone, he wrote the complaint.
He also called on police officers to arrest ISIS in his hospital room.
He explained himself in all 22 charges for not being guilty.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, explained that she was “suddenly disappointed” because of the decision of the government.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty will replace a debt in exchange for a life-long life-free punishment without the possibility of permission to accept the trauma that is experienced only by all participants," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously prayed not to claim the death penalty.
A member of the conservative party requests that NIGEL FARAGE transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has a challenge to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest in the context of the Touries conference.
The former Ukip party leader stated that politicians "have to feel "the pressure" of the Eurosceptor," while a member of Theresa Mays Party suggested that danger should lead to negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Interbank Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would “be already out” if Farage Brexit Minister was.
The challenge faced by May in the deterioration of its deeply broken party was that members of your party, who are in the EU for a stay, were forced to participate in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems in keeping his compromise plan to check on Chequers despite attacks by Brexit speakers, Brexit Winners and the EU.
It was agreed that despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to deal with Brussels and should therefore be forced by Eurosceptic and opposition working parties to decide between their package and the Chaos.
Bone explained on the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Checks on the Müll’.
He suggested that a party had been named Farague and that he should be entrusted with the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he were responsible for it, then we would already be out,’ he explained.
The Commissioner of Wellingborough added: ‘I will agree for the Brexit, but Chequers is on the mill.’
His opposition to the EU, he said, "We have not fought in World Wars to be subversive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone argued that the public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.’
The president of the Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and explained: “I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is not popular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it is disliked in our own party and in our activists who actually go through the streets and ensure that we are selected.
Please give Chequers up and begin to listen.”
In a clear message to May, she continued: ‘Ministers will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage explained in a statement that politicians must ‘press’, they should be just following the decision of the 2016 referendum.
'This is now a question of trust between us, the people and our political class', so farage.
'They try to deny the Brexit, and that is why we are here today to say to them: 'This is why you do not come'.
Before a surprising amount, he continued: ‘I want you to send our political class, which is just ahead of you, to send the Brexit to the press.
“We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which will take us to victory in the referendum and will never come to peace, unless we are independent, self-managed, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit-genners were marched through Birmingham, before they held a two-hour competition in the city center.
A few of the most active bats of the Tories against Brexit Grouping, a group of Brexit Winners within May's party, called on the weekend of life.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, was very pleased with the Tories which had security problems with a party app when opening the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the wireless border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland,” says Adonis.
‘This is a farce.
There is just the good Brexit', he added.
Warren plant, Presidential Candidacy “to test”
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the election in November, she would “check the presidential candidate exactly”.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts about their future.
Warren, a critic of President Donald Trump, is just in the race for the re-election of the Senate against the Republican Members of the Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chaired by the Tromps Election Team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the midpoint of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been since Trump's office attendance of 36. Meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format.
One of the people present asked her if you wanted to apply for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it would be "to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government and include women at the summit."

The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on the murder scene on the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims from Friday.
At a press conference, the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been scheduled to take 11 o'clock in the morning.
On Friday, they had released a video of the shooter and asked for help in identifying the man who was to see the recording.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot in the morning near the Southern University campus.

Large price from Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Master title after his team has left the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in Qualification in front of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that staff members of Mercedes would play a great role in the race.
From the Polish position along the bottas a good start and it was almost as leading to Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to join his teammates.
Vettel first went to the box and let Hamilton stay in the traffic at the end of the driveway, a decision that would have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went into the box and landed behind the Vettel, but he was overrun by Hamilton after a close radio and radio mannover, where the Ferrari pilot tried to release the inside page, with the risk of two moves to protect the third curve.
Max Steps started on one of the back places of the field and lay on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then for a large part of the race of the fastest, because he kept on his tracks to quickly end and overcome Kimi Raikcones for the fourth place.
Finally, he went to the 44th round in the box and it was not possible to take a step in the remaining eight rounds while raikkons finished as fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri has been doing a great job all weekend and how a real gentleman has treated me when he should have passed me over.
The team has been doing great work to achieve a double side," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump was pleased at a election event on Senator Diane Feinstein, who needed to give the press a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which he presented the candidates for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's sexual abuse.
At the meeting in West Virginia, President Fords spoke not directly to the Court's Committee of Justice, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are “common, greedy and dishonest”.
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the past few days in the Senate is when you see the forest when you see people who are angry and angry and angry and mean and innocent," said the President.
“When you look at the leaks and then you say: “Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, were you responsible for the Leak?
Think about your answer... Publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't published it."
Okay, just a minute.
We've... no, we haven't published it," he added by taking over the senator's voice.
Feinstein's letter with Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was filed in July, and he was published in early September. However, Feinstein contends that the Leak comes from her office.
"I haven't forgotten Dr. Ford's charges, I haven't published your story," Feinstein explained to the Committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I have spoken to her request for confidentiality.”
Her dementia seemed to be not welcome to the presidents, who said on Saturday evening about the election campaign: “I tell you something that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuing defense of the judge's candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the Democrats claimed that the charges would be used for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain the power with all means.
You see the community, the evils, they don't care who hurt them when they let them fall under the wheel to get power and control," said the president, saying mediate.

Flights in Micronesia: Air Niugini is now reported by a missing person after flight in Lagune
The flight company that carried out the flight, which crashed into a Pacific lake in Micronesia, is now reported by a missing person, after first claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini explained in a message that she could not say anything about a passenger's stay until Sunday afternoon.
The airport offered to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members after the aircraft was hit by the landing on the Chuuk Island airport in the water.
Officials allowed seven persons to be brought to a hospital.
The airline announced that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital, but they were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact timing of the accident remain unclear.
The airlines and the U.S. Navy both stated that the aircraft landed shortly before the airport in Lagune.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was flying over the railway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very slow.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to swim through heavy water to the noteages on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots were eating and screaming in panic and that he experienced a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that Matros, who worked near the improvement of an alegislator station, took an open boat to help people get to the coast before the plane was about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water sand.
The aviation Safety Network data show that 111 people have come to life in Absorption from airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of these concerns Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds the passage of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charges were closed in the recast of a case in which a man is asked to have a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information assessment.
He explained to the jury how he rebuilt the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to receive position data from different phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, as the newspaper Clarion Leiger.
When the data showed that his phone was in time at Chambers, in which he offered to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford took part in witnessing on Saturday and said that he had not been in the city on the day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had told the truth, when he said that he had been in Sanford's pick-up this night, Sandford said he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis offered to have met Chambers at her death for two weeks.
But phone records showed that they could do it for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost their messages, calls and contact information from his phone for some time after Chambers' death.
"He cut her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense is expected to begin on Sunday.
The Court of Justice concludes that the procedure shall continue on this day before the jury.

Another black one?
New York Children's Children's Day Apologize for a release after "racist" SMS
A New York child girl laments a couple for a discriminatory release after she received a misdirected message from her mother, in which she accused her of being “one more black”.
The couple struggle to be racist and compare the legal struggle with a "repression".
The second mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her admiration when she discovered that the new mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she attended her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEIN, NO ONE SCHWARZE", wrote a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending this to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After acknowledging her fauxpas, the “painly affected” plastic-Flaxman Maurice came out and claimed that the locked afro-American mother had done bad work and she had waited for a Philippinesian instead, so the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent to the house with an uber.
Maurice now accuses the couple of damages for the release and makes a claim on compensation for the $350 per day that she has spent over six months in the job for which she was originally booked, but without contract, and for which she had lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, what you don't do," she explained to the newspaper on Friday, "I know that discrimination is discrimination."
The couple showed the racial prejudices back and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after which they had taught them, could no longer be trusted.
"My wife sent something that she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you trust your children to a person who was unable to resist them even if it was out of sight?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the legal dispute with a “repression” and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was “in a difficult situation”.
“Do they want to interest such a person?
This is not very net," the investment banker added.
As the legal dispute continues, the couple were quickly condemned in the public and discussed on the social media, where they were criticized for their conduct and logic.
The sponsors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speech barrier, including a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to translate into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very important with our knowledge of Paddington's great success today."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small piece of playbook to write the book, had no problem with it, would have been denied his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death in the last year was “bitched”.
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, whom she described as “a very important member of the family”.
"He was a very stupid man and he didn't speak," Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you had a child that made something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he's seen Paddington's success like that.
Although he found and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to take her over the phone.
After the country, her daughter was brought to the hospital in Nizza, Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried to save her life.
“Nothing regularly called on to say that it really looked bad and that the doctors missed her little chance,” says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to be taken by her.
And I did it.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that you have given your doctors to keep your heart on pumps, sound slowly and leave your body.
She was dead shortly before, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't wait to do anything but wait while I knew what was going ahead.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really needed to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now suffered the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers who had nothing to do with what she had done on board the plane.
"No one knew it," she said.
I had to cut my head and train me all the time over the wagons.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I received this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Tragic women depend on cards to prevent suicide on bridges.
Two women who have lost a suicide attempt to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hang on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting stations.
Davis son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and was just 18 when he started suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had an impressive bed.
“Each one knew him for his own sake.
Everyone said that his beds could get a room."
However, he announced his work before his death because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his 11-year-old brother.
Davis explained: "I was always afraid that this might have an effect."
Davis has designed the cards “to show people that there are people who can go and talk to them even if they are friends.
Don't stay still: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, whom she was with for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say he was down or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On the night of his death, he was on the ground, and when the children took off their gifts, he did not see them in their eyes, nor did he see them.
She said that her death was a great tragedy for her, but that she had to go through: “There is a lot of trouble in the family.
It hurts us.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaughs' future in Sweden begins with investigations
"I thought that if we could actually get something like this because he asked for it, so a time-limited and in-depth investigation, we might be able to get a little input," says Flake on Saturday. He was afraid that the Committee in the political position was "inconsistencies".
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI's findings?
Your will can be returned to Timing alone.
The elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans, as expected, were to break away badly, they would be very weak in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush hired the telephone player to call senators and to convince them to support Kavanaugh. He worked in the White House for Bush and met with his wife, Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate in the current 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can join at least 50 votes in the Senate, what Mike Pence, the vice-president, would allow him to decide with equality of voice, and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean crossings under Kim
The number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has been weakened since Kim Young and seven years ago, such a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-sug, referring to data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, stated that 1127 passengers were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human mussels as main factors.
Pjungjang was not publicly involved with this.
The vast majority of the passengers from the north are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul notes that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flights over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, are easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China sees the survivors more than illegal immigrants because they are refugees and often return with violence.
The relations between the north and the south, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State in Pjungjang met to discuss the proposed denuclearisation negotiations.
This led to the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to engage once and for all," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not suitable for the Office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the representative's house, Nancy Pelosi, called Judge's candidate Brett Kavanaugh "histerical" and said he was in character inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't deny the impression that a woman who had done so would have been referred to as a hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh demented in an emotional way all charges that he had abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually as both teenagers.
During his opening hours, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed almost and stopped in tears when he spoke to his family and his high school time.
He has also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and announced the charges against him a "great and coordinated rufmort", which was organised by Liberals, who were angry about Hillary Clinton's losing presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaughs' statement proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was opposed to Democrats.
"I believe that he has explained himself in this statement and in the way and way that he has raised himself over the Clintons and Democrats, even for the inconsistencies," she explained.
Pelosi wished, when asked if they would try to convince Kavanaugh of the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority of the representative's house.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his present judges," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions of Kavanaughs against the absurd Care Act or the ruling of the ruling principle Roe v. Wade, as he is regarded as a conservative judge.
In his hearing, Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We do not need a hysterical, pre-eminent person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'I am not wonderful'," says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It is a fair hassredrek, months and years of the raining forest and it does not come out without a weed.
“We swear when we get angry,” said Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
She added: “I was helped by a woman who was some kind of manager, and she said that she was a virgin when she became angry, but had developed a technique. If she was angry and started to laugh, she said to the person she said: “They may think they’re sad because I’m drunk.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I found it great."
Trains are allowed as valves for iron, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in an office dominated by men, where I spent a day in a state of unexplained noise and by an old woman, a troubled manager, before I always had a little fear, was packed into the arm and taken into a wooden house.
"Never let them see that you're drunk," she said to me.
"They don't know you're a stench.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think you're going to go to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, a convention director from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when a ship's ship named Monkey Business was landed on a ship and its candidate returned to it, the most frustrated Schroeder argued that there was no reason to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"This was no good decision," she told me 30 years later with a lake.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone announced the situation: ‘Schneewichtchen and the seven victors’.
As the election struggle had already progressed, she was back in the middle of the strike and she would not be forced to apply if she did not have $2 million in total.
It was an invisible struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who spent $1,000 on the men, only supported her campaign with $250.
"Do you believe that I get a discount?" she asked herself.
In the talk she announced, not to start an official campaign, she was so moved by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made the media creation and the direct address of the voters rather than the delegates, as well as the weather over the sexism, so overwhelming that she was close to the trains.
"I could have assumed I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press actions.
“I could have believed that the tax collector Kleneex was my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they would write on my gravestone.
"It's worth it?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the conflict between the United States and China
The openings of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming. Although the battle is not over long, Beijing could benefit from a grave between countries in a long-term view, my experts.
Donald Trump, the American President, burned the first Warning Committee at the beginning of the year when he charged important Chinese exporters, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with criminal oil.
This week, with new criminal oil on goods worth 200 billion dollars, the most important issue was that of all of China's imported goods in the USA.
Peking used to run back on the same kind every time, and recently he won a fine of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China is difficult to respond to any US action, and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power of the world will soon collapse.
Moving Washington to join would mean following. However, a public engagement against the United States would be too expensive for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, my experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war long ago by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision could create conditions for economic turbulence in both countries either in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously known," says Abigail Grace, a scientific worker who focuses on Asia in the thinking factory Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country that has been forced into the war for over seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulalem stated that conditions in the country would improve.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he explained.
The government rebuilds the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to bring about normality.
All conditions have now been granted for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave because of terrorism and the economic measures that they had to make every day and the foundations of their lives.
UNO estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
More than six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government was pleased to help rebuild the country.
However, he stressed that there would be no provision for assistance from countries that had supported the stand.
Europe won a victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and visited the United States team with an end of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soils and has not won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the US.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had most of the tournament problem, reduced his resignation on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds, and was one of four players who scored a 5-0-0, since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit by the player with the lowest ranking in the team of Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best rank, Dustin Johnson, has lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all times with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t normally drink, but today I couldn’t stop.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the hell back.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have contributed," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues to reach his Landsmann John Ram, who won the U.S. Golf League Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the single match.
I'm so proud to have shot Tiger Woods, who I've been following since my childhood on television," says the 23-year-old frame.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A remarkable statistics for one of the largest players of all time, which has won 14 important titles and will only be exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to find the Fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who have completed high-card services throughout the tournament.
The American captain Jim Furyk said after a surprising performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Get out of here for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players had a good performance.
We will be regrouped, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be her captain.
You have to pull the trigger.
We've been defeated."
