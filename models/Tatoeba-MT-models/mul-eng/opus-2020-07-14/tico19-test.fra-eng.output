Rapid increase in the combined incidence of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The combined incidence of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar evolution in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming and, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in all countries.
According to the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a few patients with COVID-19 who need care, in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, an unknown etiology pneumonia phenomenon was reported in Wuhan, the province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control identified the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as Coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been baptized with coronavirus (COVID-19).
Today, about 80 per cent of COVID-19 people are suffering from an illness, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, most of which are healing.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 is a more serious attack that requires hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a serious form of disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalised patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In the context of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the combined impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom (U.S.) and compare it with the developments in the province of Hubei, China.
We will also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri and al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe after the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan in the province of Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been detected in each 30 EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (U.S.) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining the accumulated number and the combined incidence of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECPCM), the number of cases reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as health departments, national and regional health authorities in different countries as well as WHO, is updated daily at 08 p.m.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to establish a comparison with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 within each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We have also compared the combined number of cases reported in each country from 15 March 2020 to 8 p.m. with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 evolution in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of the incidence of COVID-19 cases within the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom has generally followed it from the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the combined impact of COVID-19 has begun to increase around 21 February before a dramatic increase in the surrounding 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This evolution was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom presented a similar increase in the combined impact of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in relation to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases reported by COVID-19 increases rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 suggests that pandemics progress at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in responses to national public health services, potential variations in the definition of cases, as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for the purpose of confirmation of COVID-19, including for the rattage tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy indicated that approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (unsubmitted data).
However, a systematic collection is needed to complete the current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed an important difference in the number of beds available in European intermediate and intensive care services, ranging from 29.2 litres per 100,000 individual in Germany to 4.2 litres in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 litres of intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios relating to the satisfaction of the capacity of care, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalised cases associated with a risk > 90% of overcapacity in intensive care are provided in the sixth update of the CEPCM's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally welcome a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care should be set out in priority level 2 of the Statistical Units Nomenclature (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore prepare for a Community-supported SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who need care, in particular intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and extensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, through an end-up approach to an early approach, to the extent that the rapid and early increase in the number of cases could not be sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also reflects public health measures to reduce the impact of pandemics.
There is a short window in which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without it, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a few patients in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
As its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which led thousands of SRAS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by the noise keys and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
The COVID-19, however, presents a greater severity and mortality than SRAS, but it is much more transmissible, and it affects older people than young people and increases men and women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide an appropriate and comprehensive review of this subject of thorough research.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this review will contribute to better understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The spring festival, on 25 January 2020, has always marked the Chinese, who have been forced to stay closed for the whole week of gold and for many other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the Coronavirus (CoV) that causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) in 2003; that is why SARS-CoV-2 was baptized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease called Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China before it spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus had caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nej.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 work has been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, ethics, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 on the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review tries to synthesize research progress on this new subject in full detail.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SRAS and another coronavirus disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic in 2012).
We will also focus on what we have learned so far in terms of prevention and forecasting of disease, and we will address some still outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered as non-fatal pathogens for the Human, mainly causing approximately 15% of common fungi 4.
However, during this century we have known two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for the Human, namely SARS-CoV and MercS-CoV, which have caused an outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third outbreak of coronavirus in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1.1, the pneumonic tumors of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic was rapidly spreading to nearby towns, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was located in quarantine with the interruption of its entire public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, on 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been directly in contact with the Wuhan marine fruit market, considered to be the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO qualified for the World Health Emergency Epidemic.
At the time of the drafting of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure.2).
As the situation progresses rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHXa1qHA2bbadA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly within 30-65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were 20 years old, and only 14 were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 developed in fireplaces, mainly in the province of Hubei and in Periphery.
The average duration between the occurrence of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average duration between the occurrence of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (IC to 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people has increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, which coincides with the mass displacements that took place before the spring festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were gender (human), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large developed viruses containing a simple brin ARN.
They can be classified into four species, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the known coronaviruses to infect the Man belonging to the alpha and beta species.
Spike (S) of the pack is based on angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and peptidase-4 dipeptidyl (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, after a membrane merger occurs.
The viral Arn gene is released in the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral gene, the genetic Arn is accompanied by glycoproteins of packaging and nucleopside proteins in the form of vehicles containing viruses, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken on the site of the epidemic's origin, the Huanan marine fruit market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Thanks to the electronic microscopy in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in the ultrafine sections of human epithelium of respiratory pathways.
ACE2 was identified as a recipient of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, S protein S of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to ACE2 less human than that of SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less significant infection than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by Orf3b and a secret protein coded by Orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNB; however, the Orf8 does not contain known domains or functional reasons.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, and al., presented the complete ECE2 Cryo-ME structure to a resolution of 2.9 Å complex with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed compliance, was assembled in the form of dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening in order to eliminate infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The source and intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were provided with sound keys and that they were transmitted to the Man via the civilians and camels, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the souries were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SRAS-type coronaviruses from the sourial key called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZXX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to break the species barrier to infected Man remains unknown, and the transmission path is still to be elucidate.
Ji, and al., have issued the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted to Man by snakes, which would involve a homologous combination of S proteins.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a long museum mammifer, often used as a traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if it was judged by genetic homology by 99% of a coronavirus found in the pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference between 1 % and 2 genomes is an important difference; it is therefore appropriate to wait for the final results to establish concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40 to 50 % humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75 %, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chlorform, and other fat solutions, but not chlorhexidine, may effectively infect the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we cannot refer only to studies previously conducted on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figu.4.4).
In general, when a host virus is infected, it is first recognised by the immune system derived from it through molecular-recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C-read receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-I receptors (RLRs).
In different ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cells mature and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophase of viral antibodies.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may allow the virus to escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response combines the fight against the virus.
Lymphocytes T, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in the defence.
The T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells that produce specific virus antibodies, and T CD8+ cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, the coronavirus may inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Homogeneous immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient have neutralised the MercS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system results in a localized explosion of free radicals, which can cause serious injuries to the lungs and to other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multi-visceral failure, death.
The infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterised by a fireplace appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with conorbidities and pregnant women.
It is strongly acknowledged that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be between 1 and 14 days, but more than 3 to 7 days after a study of 425 first cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, for a fever ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, has concluded a 4.8-day incubation period (3.0-7.2) following a demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective duration of the quarantine after a period of incubation as clearly as possible in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
In general, people exposed to, or infected by, the virus is stored in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended for 24 days?
The fever often consists of the first and main symptoms of COVID-19, and may be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, rash, muscle pain, vomiting, headache, stomach pain, rhinorhee, thoracic pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had a dyspnoea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the disease occurred.
With regard to serious cases, patients have rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acid and coagulopathy.
Patients presenting fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those presenting acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiographic anomalies, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 showed that patients were suffering from fever at 98%, drying at 76%, dyspnoea at 55% and diarrhoea at 3%; 8% of patients needed ventilator assistance.
Similar findings have been reported by two recent studies on a family and a feeder following the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98 per cent), dry weight (47 per cent) and dyspnoea (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent needed ventilator assistance, or much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher Melris loyalty compared to COVID-19.
A diarrhoea (26%) and a gastrointestinal disease (21%) have also been observed in patients treated with MERS.
With regard to SRAS, the main symptoms were fever (99 per cent to 100 per cent), dry weight (29 per cent to 75 per cent), dyspnoea (40 per cent to 42 per cent), diarrhoea (20 per cent to 25 per cent) and stomach disease (13 per cent to 25 per cent), and ventilate assistance was necessary for about 14 to 20 per cent of patients.
On 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2%, for 66,576 cases confirmed worldwide.
Similarly, the mortality of SRAS in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) to 95% of 5,71-7.23 while the R0 of SARS-CoV only reached from 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MARS-CoV and SARS-COV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a more important capacity to spread than MSRS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but that it is less lethal.
As a result, it is much more difficult to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics than it has been for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a fire often occurs within a family or in a assembly or vehicle, as in the case of a cruiser.
Patients have often traveled to or resided in Wuhan or in other affected regions, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients in the two weeks prior to the occurrence of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can be carrying the virus without the presence of symptoms for more than two weeks and that retable patients can be re-porters of the virus, stressing the need to increase the duration of administration in quarantine.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aminotransferase aspartate and a virus were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels in the blood, and most had a higher rate of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte seduction.
In the most serious cases, the D-demerer rate, a fibrine degradation product present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes decreased gradually.
There are anomalies of thoracic radiographation in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral inegal clouds or an anti-emergency in the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory depression syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas trade.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in surface rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of lungs to freeze and increase the risk of pulmonary collapsing.
As a result, the most disturbing therapeutic examinations often coincide with the most serious form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of the COVID-19 revealed a decline in pneumocytitis, hyalinic membrane training, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and is similar to that of patients with SRAS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ARN through a chain reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of negative, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was then not only on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for SRAS diagnosis.
Thus, the combination of medical prioritises, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol to use the SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which enables the identification of synthetic ARN fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per sample microlitre) with a reactive band within an hour without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practice, if its use on clinical specimens would be complete.
Because of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MercS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressors, steroids, retable patients’ plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of retable patients has been proposed for treatment purposes.
The pharmaceutical companies are all used to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects lungs during the first time and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve the symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-debit oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, according to the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms should receive an extra-body membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary clearance technique used to treat heart failure or critical respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of the functions of vital organs, are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been established that an excessive reaction of the immune system leads to a cytokinetic shock in patients with SRAS and MERS.
Cytokinic shock is a systemic inflammatory response characterised by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNB, IFNG and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and a multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinetic shocks, particularly for severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokinetic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinetic shocks include modulation of immune response by T cells, blocking IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokines 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SRAS in order to reduce the severity of inflammation.
However, high dose steroids did not have any beneficial effects on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would have serious side effects, including an avascular osteonecrosis, which would significantly affect the forecast.
However, the use of low-moderate short-term corticosteroid cycles has been recommended for patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of the drafting of this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet to be confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of ammedesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Armdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed at the beginning of Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
As a result, the armdecivir has also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other viruses to simple brin Arn, including MERS and SRAS.
In view of these findings, Gilead transmitted the composition to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon α, lopinavir/ritonavir association and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients suffering from acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hepatitis and other side effects may occur following a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir association.
Interaction with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Tablet patients plasma and anti-body production
Collecting blood from patients with contagious disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from it is an anti-serial practice.
In fact, retable patients often have a relatively high rate of antibodies to pathogens.
Antibodys are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
The plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients with COVID-19 cures and was injected to 10 severely infected patients.
Their symptoms improved at 24 hours, associated with a decrease in the inflammation phenomenon, a reduction in viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some adverse reactions associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a cytokines release syndrome, potentially fatal.
Concentration of antibodies in blood is generally low, and plasma demand for treatment of patients severely ill is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate the B cells from retable patients and identify the genetic codes covering the relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the major proteins of the virus.
This would speed up the production of antibodies.
The MTC has been used from millions in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to diagnosis, based on the MTC theory.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their best associations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or severe form of disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen gels have been shown to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 have been observed in the provinces of China who have applied to MTC for 87 per cent of their patients, including the province of Gansu (63.7%), the region of Ningxia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the province of Hubei, which has applied only to 30 per cent of the patients with COVID-19, shows the lowest cure rate (13 per cent).
However, this is rather approximate because many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account for the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment using the Western Medicine (MO) only and combined treatment involving MO and MTC.
It appears that the period of return to normal body temperature, the time of disappearance of symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were much shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of severity of symptoms (of mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and innocence of the MTC remains to be explained through increased and more controlled testing and centres.
It would also be interesting to characterise the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of MTC treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally concerned with this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those places in quarantine also experience a feeling of anger, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoglycaemia and swelling, as well as the side effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the SRAS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crises, psychomotic excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact research and quarantine research, in response to public health services at the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase the anxiety and guilt of certain diseases with regard to the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to individuals identified as likely cases, to persons in contact with these populations, and to any other person in distress.
This psychological support must include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and precise updates on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and treatment plans, as well as the use of electronic applications and equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to halt the transmission chain of animal reserves and human beings infected with vulnerabilities, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based vaccines S to produce long-term neutralising antibodies and/or induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live vaccines were evaluated on animal models for SRAS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in elderly people and on models submitted to a lethal produktion and their protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as long as no clinical study has been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SRAS grew up 17 years ago and that no new case has been reported since.
On the other hand, MERS' sporadic cases and fraud continue to be reported in the Middle East and in other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS through the inactive virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein sub-units, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective for controlling the epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the important length (18 months in average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As a result of an emergency disease, the COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the disease is gradually recuperated without delay.
However, at the start of the SRAS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, setting a forecast model is essential for health agencies to give priority to their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies carried out so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the predictation of patients with COVID-19 are the following (Table 33):
Age: age was the main factor for SRAS projection, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% over 50 years, according to a study conducted on 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (mean age 66 versus 51 years old), suggesting age as a predictor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more people than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SRAS.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be also linked to ACE2's positive chhologiocytes, which can lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and can interact with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the rate of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury; it has been advanced as a factor in the potential predictor of disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the rate of CRP and severity as well as the forecast of COVID-19 was also proposed.
Furthermore, a high rate of dehydrogen lactate (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alanine (ALT) and kinase creatinine (CK) may also participate in the establishment of the forecast.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, including heart and liver levels, and are released in case of tissue injury.
Thus, they are traditionally marked for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of thoracic radiographics and the gradual progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in combination with other elements to determine the forecast and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressors to treat infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammation.
Since high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used for severe cases of SRAS, many survivors have presented an avascal osteoencrosis resulting in permanent disability and medical quality.
Thus, if necessary, administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 epidemic caused a large number of exceptional stress cases, often known for long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of close or other patients.
It is imperative to propose a psychological accompanying and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to the demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 seems to present different epidemiological characteristics of SRAS.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 also effectively repeats in higher respiratory pathways and does not or may not cause symptoms in the first phase of infection, in the case of coronaviruses at the origin of common rhumms.
Consequently, newly infected or incubated individuals may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by patients seriously ill, with a very low likelihood of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than was the SRAS.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the bordering of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continuedization of the population's almost totality in order to stop the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the growth phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, and so on, with the COVID-19, which seems to be much more infectious than SRAS, will not be extended in 2020.
Ira Longini, etc., set up a model to predict the outbreak and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the seizures of moderate nasal cornet and retables of patients, 2 weeks after their departure from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode at the time of flu.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the progressive reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial estimates, Ebola virus had to lead to a million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally controlled.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 decreases in terms of infection to eventually expand or develop in a less pathogenic virus co-existing with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SRAS and MERS is provided below (Figure. (Figu.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by waves or aliens, as well as possible by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in cells, thus creating a new possibility of feco-ral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41 per cent of cases were likely due to noccomomic infections, with 17 patients with prior diseases and 40 health professionals.
It is therefore appropriate to take precautions to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, close and sick colleagues, and even anyone who is likely to be in contact with patients or persons infected.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling the spread of viruses.
The surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected goutlets or deposit them on surfaces where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of viruses of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5 % of fully-painted viruses; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, as both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since the individuals are able to pass five surgical masks on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients carry N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must carry adjusted isolation blocks to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye route.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor appeared to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have damaged his body by eye contact due to inflammation.
As a result, health professionals must also carry transparent views or protective lenses to the patient’s contact.
For the populations of affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash your hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to stay confined to maximum levels and to limit all contact with potentially infected persons.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one meter with patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for Human, its high level of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, has to have placed China in a state of high alert after the SRAS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre would reassure the population by stating that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable release, especially at the time when the whole country was preparing for the spring festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missing.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn lessons and take the measures that are required.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful in their public announcements, as each word can affect the behaviour and decision of the population; (2) show greater sensitivity and reactivity to the unusual clinical data than to wait for formal reports of doctors or official bodies; (3) show more restrictive to contain potential epidemics at their beginnings than to try to reassure the population; and (4) make greater use of targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the system of society's response.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the drafting of this report, it extended to China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to SRAS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as a pre-vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SRAS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and increases men and women; pregnancy and mortality rates are also more important among older people.
SRAS presents a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SRAS was mainly transmitted by patients seriously ill; therefore it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and much more than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 Arn detection tests may appear negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, retable patients may be again positive to the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of proliferation.
Despite the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain pending, including:
Where's SARS-CoV-2?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SRAS-type coronaviruses, this is not enough to conclude with certainty that SARS-COV-2 comes from chiropteres.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, such as the souri keys, to the Man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the epidemic can take place at any time.
A molecular modelling and biochemical analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 is based on ACE2, but how does the virus get into the respiratory cells and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Does the virus also appear in cells expressing the ECE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and precise diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long has the epidemic been going on?
How does the virus develop on the genetic level in the interhuman transmission?
Will it develop in global pandemics, disappear as SRAS or reversing surfaces regularly like flu?
It is essential, even if this can take time, to get answers to all these questions as well as to many others.
However, regardless of the costs this should entail, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the period of incubation of these two viruses is lower than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodepressed patients have experienced severe infections of lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SRAS took place in the province of GuangDong in China by the end of 2002.
Without regard to the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could trigger approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, the peak of the viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected by SARS-CoV are initially exposed to myalgia, headaches, fever, malaise and fever, dyspnoea, swelling and respiratory depression such as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver failure tests and high kinase creatinine are current anomalies observed in laboratory analysis in SRAS suspects.
A wide range of strokes, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophages increase are also observed in patients with SRAS.
Some 20 to 30 per cent of patients then need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory pathways, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by a cytokinic shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was common among young children, elderly people, and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is current in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal removal of a 8-month pneumonia sufferer in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is in fact present in the world.
The HCoV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive lens, also called crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized in Hong Kong due to pneumonia and bronchioliitis.
For HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, resulting in moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves in a continuous way to humans, they also become less viral or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestations are similar to those of SRAS and are characterized by evolutionary acute pneumonia.
Unlike SRAS, many patients suffering from MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS in relation to pathology in HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories were reported with a high mortality rate, or 34.4 per cent, which is one of the most deadly viruses known in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread in the world.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the six other HCoV revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
Firstly, the duration of incubation and the duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four Community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in cell samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable dissemination after transmission to humans, will have an impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCoVs resulting from moderate symptoms are well adapted to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
In order for this to occur, HCoVs must be applied to human beings in sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the factors of the host restriction.
In this perspective, the more SARS-CoV-2 epidemics persist and the more people infected are important, the more there are chances that the virus is completely adapted to man.
If appropriate, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quarter or by other measures to control infections.
For many years, the four coVs acquired in the community are moving around within the population, triggering a simple rhumm in immunocompetitive subjects.
These viruses do not need to reserve animals.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogens, are not well adapted to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and expand in their zootic reserves and seek an opportunity to achieve human potential potential, probably through one or more intermediate and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 presents similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV acquisitions in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see if it will be fully adapted to human beings and will travel among these last without a reserve or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCV, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reserves, intermediate and amplifiers of HCV.
An animal serves as a evolutionary hothouse of a HCoV when it opens a nearby climber sharing a high level of nymology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The original virus is often well adapted and is not pathogenic for its host.
In the same way, a reserve host opens the HCoV in a continuous and long-term way.
On the other hand, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate hotel and even establish a long-term endemicness.
In this case, the intermediate hotel becomes a natural reserve guest.
In particular, given that 80 per cent of Guangzhou market animals have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also serve as amplifier intermediate hostess cannot be excluded.
These sound keys are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequences.
These studies have laid the basis for a new concept where the sun-keys are the host of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology among these two viruses, it is generally considered that the WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that the sound keys are not the immediate reserve of SARS-CoV.
That's why the noise keys can't be the intermediate reserve host of the MercS-CoV.
In addition to studies conducted in the Middle East, thinkers were sero-positive to specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-CoV, as well as the original camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excretion the virus not only by respiratory pathways but also by fecal route, which also constitutes the main route of excretion of the noise keys.
We cannot exclude the possibility that Pangolin is one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal guests.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less important than that which separates beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from Pangolin.
Recombination is a major factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could be removed from the CV key, while the parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rounds.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another Souri Key CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camels were also suspected of being intermediate guests.
When HCoV-OC43 broke the range of species to infect humans from domestic beet to about 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of the inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the close-sourish key of HCoV-229E were found.
First of all, unlike alpagas, men can have a contact with the noise keys in a shared ecological nest.
On the contrary, humans have close contacts with alpagas.
Then, the alpha-CoV of the sourial key associated with HCoV-229E are numerous and not pathogens in the souris, while the alpha-CoV of the alpaga caused a respiratory disease in the infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga has not been found in wild animals.
In fact, sours are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that noise keys can transmit HCoV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV of the sourial key serves as the genetic reserve of HCoV-229E, alpagas and rumamers could serve as intermediate hotspots that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MercS-CoV.
The MercS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of noise keys to lubricants and lubricants to humans.
The evolutional origin of the MercS-CoV found in the souri keys is known through its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, the MercS-CoV has been present in the rummers for decades.
It was well adapted to these rooms that have been served as an intermediate hotel for guests with stable natural reservations.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of the MercS-CoV, the role of Pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, the pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in the pangolins.
Several inter-species of SARS-CoV-2 animals have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, the noise keys could be the host to reserve a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People could share an ecological nest with the sun-crows through the depletion or carbon mines.
Second, the pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts where a virus associated with SRAS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced.
People contract the virus by weight and consumption of gibier meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that have been both in contact with the souries and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other viruses in ARN with simple brin, the estimated mutation rates of the CVs could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, according to the CV adjustment phase for new guests.
However, CV mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CVs do not fit well at the hotel.
As for SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already been adapted to another nearby host of people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the rummers.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic origin makes vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in a short term.
Thirdly, the CVs are changing slowly and frequently in the replication of the ARN through a single "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for the COVs observed in the animal, such as the SL-CoV and the batCoV-HKU9.
Interaction virus-host in connection with transmission
In addition to these three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with a host receiver is another key factor affecting inter-species transmission.
The SARS-CoV combination is used as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection evidence during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to man.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in unit S1 of protein S means that the affinity of this protein S to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic microscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between SARS-CoV ACE2 and S protein S.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In addition, HCoV-NL63 is also located at ACE2 but with a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminoopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of human and HCV natural reserves, such as solar keys, drummers and rollers, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
Emergency of new HCoV: return to the home
The diversity of sound-key CVs offers many emergency opportunities for new HCoVs.
In this sense, the Souri Key CVs are genetic reserves of HCoV.
Among SARS-CoV's accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered to be important in human adaptation, given that SARS-CoV key viruses were isolated, but identified different ORF8 proteins.
This removal separates ORF8 from ORF8a and ORF8b and is present as an adaptive change that contributes to the change in the host.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
It has also been demonstrated that the MERS-CoV epidemic has been known to recombination episodes between different lines, which have occurred in the rummers in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the noise and camium viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpha-CoV of the alpha-Coga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, triggering a decline in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also encouraged by the selective pressure exercised in their reserve hosts.
Cases of asymptomatic or moderate symptoms have been detected when sours were infected by the CVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between the CVs and the souris.
It seemed that the sound keys were well adapted to the CV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the soybeans effectively reduce the pathology derived from the CVs.
In addition, the high level of active oxygen (DRO) derivatives generated by high metabolic activity of the souries could both delete the replication of the CV and affect the "reading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when they are introduced into a new hotel.
More pathogens could also develop by combination, triggering the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended to adapt the hotel.
Thus, this is not a hazard if three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
The CVs are not pathogens or cause moderate symptoms in their guests to be reserved as shoes and camels.
They respond firmly without causing a strong immune response from the hotel.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptotic carriers are present and what causes severe infections in humans.
Severe symptoms are essentially due to the hyperactivity of immune response and cytokinic shock; the more immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
In contrast, in the asymptomatic ports, the immune response was obtained from the replication of the CV.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early phase of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammase inflammable inflammation is weak in the souries.
Following this justification, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a 95 % nucleotide-CoV beta-CoV-CoV-containing key sharing with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a CV-Syrian key sharing 96 % nucleotide-HOM with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-Covs were found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that Pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that Pangolin's Pangolin beta-Cov may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CVs have been returned to the flames of the ram due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MercS-CoV exists in the drummer for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and milk for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the METS, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recent MERS epidemics, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could arise and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circling in nature.
In particular, the souri key CVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The culture of consumption of wild animals in certain areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is an opportunity of contamination.
Continue monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the environment of the CVs and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoos is to stay away from the ecological networks of natural zoonoses reserves.
First, if the souries transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it would be interesting to note what conditions the souriskeys and the pangolins could share the same ecological nest.
Second, if noise keys play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how people enter contact with noise keys.
Thirdly, if a third mammals play the role of real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, sours and pangolins.
Whether it's a souri-key, a pangolin or another mammifer, it should be possible to identify the SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural guests.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rhumme, for example, by washing hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (e.g. mucus).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic agents (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reduction in influenza spread, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of respiratory infections; reduction of respiratory infections;
as well as reducing infant mortality rates at home.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
The pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the first cause of death in children under five years of age, which is about 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia lead to the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The washing of hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
The minor decelerate effect, the frequent washing of hands can burn the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive washing of hands could lead to exacema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by skin rash and dementia, and particularly frequent in health workers.
The excessive washing of hands is also considered to be one of the symptoms of the complex obsessive disorder (TOC).
The elimination twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands to the soap and brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothbrush, is at the heart of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of knowledge and determinants is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase solubility.
The water alone is not an effective clean skin, given that lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of the soil, are difficult to solve in the water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can confirm bacteria derived from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants allows the target of antibiotics resistant to the environment.
Therefore, even if antibiotics resistant strains are not the product of antibacterial knowledge, the latter could not be as effective as they were announced.
In addition to the stress-active and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) that are used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menhol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the Public Health School of the University of Oregon indicated that regular knowledge was as effective as antibacterial knowledge for individuals and containing triclosan, in order to prevent diseases and eliminate manic bacteria.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster to body temperature (37 °C).
However, fresh water and soapy water is more effective than cold water and soapy water to eliminate natural salts and bacteria from natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of hot water did not contribute to reducing the microbial load on hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a hygiene product of non-aqueous hands.
Most are formulated based on isopropylic alcohol or ethanol associated with an agent that exhibits such carbon (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or to a inhibitor such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or muscle for a greater ease of use and to reduce the effects of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% of alcohol effectively eliminate the breasts.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as champagne.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contaminated gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to wash or cover both hands well.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace a proper washing of hands unless you have water and water.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to skin impairment if the formula is not strengthened by embolides and/or skin hydrating agents.
The acidant effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing embolants have been significantly lower in irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial known known known or rare.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or alcohol hypersensitive or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-adjusted products do not eliminate the organic materials present on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, the disinfectants for hands are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formula used for benzalkonium chloride has presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which is expected after repeated use, probably due to progressive hepatic impairment.
The earth or the earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than they know.
What is more, if land or land is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of brakes.
At the start of the soap, the powder is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends cutting or sand as an alternative to knowledge when it is not available.
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the temperature of the water does not seem to differ).
To move a generous amount of soap on their hands by fraving them against each other, without forgetting the two hands, between the fingers and under the legs.
The soap removes the skins of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when they use salt than water alone.
Flotter for at least 20 seconds.
The process of frying creates friction, which helps to eliminate the seeds of the skin, and for a longer time it takes more seeds to be removed.
Rincher enough to run into the current water.
Retaliation in a steaming water basin can lead to the retina of hands.
Safe with a private service or free air.
Washing hands and wet hands are more easily retweeted.The most often forgotten areas are the dust, the poignet, the between the fingers and the bottom of the needles.
Artificial angles and narrow angle angles may cause microorganisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin injuries that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when the water of the robinet and/or soap is not available. For example, to cool water from a suspended or dry stomach and/or waste it if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "type-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a cord, and a pedal that allows to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hands hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss it.
More and more research suggests that paper services are much more hygienic than electrical dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands in hot air dry hands, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by 194 per cent on the lungs and 254 per cent on the lungs.
The drying of dry hands in air resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the milk powder of 42 per cent and on the 15 per cent pumas.
After hand drying, the following changes in the bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different hand mill manufacturers, and hand mills have been compared to drying using paper services.
Washing hands with disinfectant lips is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that send reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
The medical washing of hands must take at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to move and freeze each part of the hands.
The hands must be broken against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper service must be used to close the robinnet (and open the exit door if appropriate).
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("brothers") and to avoid transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
after exposure to blood/a biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All the bees must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and feet up to your knees, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
In the spring, it must be avoided that water on the front of the trees does not reach their hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after being treated by a sick person.
With regard to monitoring of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of washing hands were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there was only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of washing hands more than 35%.
Further research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find robots to wash their hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hands washing stations.
However, the low wash rate of hands can also be imputable to heavy habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the manual health promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Hand Washing is another example of awareness campaign that aims to promote behavioral development.After the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emegio to illustrate hand washing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap washing is much more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetish-like haters.
In Germany, for example, exhibitions depicting the "good hand washing techniques" have been placed on the side of bars in public toilets and in office furniture and airports.
The expression “to wash your hands ” refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complicated by something.
In addition, those who are authorized to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to deliver to other compensating measures of "cleaning" such as the volunteer.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.

Because it's the flu season
It should also be pointed out that artificial selection can contribute to involuntarily changes in the genes of viruses, which are likely to follow the pressures experienced during the selection, including by the host immune system.
For example, the total loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype soybean may be mentioned, due to a delegation of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the noise and camium viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpha-CoV of the alpha-Coga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, triggering a decline in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also encouraged by the selective pressure exercised in their reserve hosts.
Cases of asymptomatic or moderate symptoms have been detected when sours were infected by the CVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between the CVs and the souris.
It seemed that the sound keys were well adapted to the CV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the soybeans effectively reduce the pathology derived from the CVs.
In addition, the activity of natural harmful cells in the sourial keys is eliminated by the recipient's positive regulation insinuating the natural harmful cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of the molecules of the major class I Histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of active oxygen (DRO) derivatives generated by high metabolic activity of the souries could both delete the replication of the CV and affect the "reading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when they are introduced into a new hotel.
More pathogens could also develop by combination, triggering the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended to adapt the hotel.
Thus, this is not a hazard if three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
The CVs are not pathogens or cause moderate symptoms in their guests to be reserved as shoes and camels.
They respond firmly without causing a strong immune response from the hotel.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptotic carriers are present and what causes severe infections in humans.
Severe symptoms are essentially due to the hyperactivity of immune response and cytokinic shock; the more immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
In contrast, in the asymptomatic ports, the immune response was obtained from the replication of the CV.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Interferon response is particularly strong in noise keys.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early phase of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammase inflammable inflammation is weak in the souries.
Following this justification, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-COV emerged.
While a 95 % nucleotide-CoV beta-CoV-CoV-containing key sharing with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a CV-Syrian key sharing 96 % nucleotide-HOM with SARS-CoV-2.
While civilians and other animals present on the markets have been found to be carrying identical viruses to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Pangolin beta-Covs were found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that Pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that Pangolin's Pangolin beta-Cov may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While there is no evidence to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, whether voluntary or accidental.
The CVs have been returned to the flames of the ram due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CVs in noise and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reserves in the transmission of HCOV to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MercS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from the sun-key and are transmitted to man by intermediate hostess.
As SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and civilians present on the markets, the closure of the markets for expensive products and the removal of civilians found to be able to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, Pangolins should be removed from the market for free products in order to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, taking into account the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of Pangolin closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to man by Pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission is produced will remain to be determined in the studies to be followed.
On the other hand, the MercS-CoV exists in the drummer for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and milk for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the METS, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recent MERS epidemics, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could arise and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circling in nature.
In particular, the souri key CVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no need for these zoonotic CVs to evolve and combine, causing the emergence of more transmissible and/or fatal new CVs in humans in the future.
The culture of consumption of wild animals in certain areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of threats caused by SRAS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and intervention plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is an opportunity of contamination.
While noise keys present many characteristics that favour the spread of viruses, the likelihood of man being in contact with noise and other wild species can be minimised if people are sensitive to the need to stay away.
Continue monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the environment of the CVs and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoos is to stay away from the ecological networks of natural zoonoses reserves.
Not all of the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SRAS-CoV-2 are known yet.
First, if the souries transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it would be interesting to note what conditions the souriskeys and the pangolins could share the same ecological nest.
Second, if noise keys play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how people enter contact with noise keys.
Thirdly, if a third mammals play the role of real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, sours and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it's a souri-key, a pangolin or another mammifer, it should be possible to identify the SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural guests.
Future research in this area will enable the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "support cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick recommendation directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new Coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and described our experience and provided references to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge gradually progress on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this e-mail, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for a "support case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Commission for the Health of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was designated a severe acute respiratory syndrome to Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO qualified the COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team made a quick recommendation that was published online on military medical research on 06 February 2020.
She has been paying much attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and our knowledge are gradually progressing on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Directives published by the National Commission for the Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.hc.gov.cn/) have been completely revised between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou and al., presented a simple assessment proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We approve their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives (see seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspect case must associate one of the characteristics of epidemiological events with two clinical manifestations to form a complete analysis, or correspond to three clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological events:
epidemiological advance: (1) a travel or residence advance in Wuhan City and in neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) a prior contact with cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acid); (3) a prior contact with patients presenting fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the course of 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) an advance of contact with cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acids); (3) an advance of contact with patients who have been reported in the city of Wuhan or other communities or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the past period prior to the occurrence of symptoms prior to the stage; (4) a case of cases of sub-classe.
Clinical disorders: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imagery presenting the characteristics of an infection with COVID-19; (3) total numbering of white globes indicating normal, reduced or reduced lymphocytes from the beginning of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be supported in the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) a real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequence of the entire viral gene with a strong homogeneity with the new known coronaviruses; (3) a positive serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; or a change of the specific IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 from positive or increased title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the same phase.
We can see that the PCR test in real-time nuclear acids in respiratory or blood clotting pathways has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic diagnosis of blood clotting was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal kit for the detection of nuclear acids for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory samples including blood collection, with increased availability of different species, and have contributed to the positive outcome of the specific antibodies in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution regarding atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou and al. should be updated as they classified people who do not have clinical symptoms such as “low risk”.
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and future studies.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “support cases” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest that we follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also provide timely updates to our directive to provide its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a newspaper record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country thus records a death record due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of infected persons registered included 114 active cases and 33 healings, which remained confined to home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closing of public transport started on 26 March and should end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) has always been authorised.
On March 19, these three people were already restored.
Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has exceeded millions worldwide, according to data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
Throughout the world, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobayin, the mother of Moscow, extended the siege of the city until 1 May.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for the extension of the 15-day national emergency status; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Human coronavirus zoonotic origins
The severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics (SRAS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the tendency to detect what HCoV infection could be devastating and potentially fatal.
Most of the HCoV come from sour keys in which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservations of certain HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CV-hôte interactions in animals could also help to better understand the CV in humans.
According to differences in protein sequences, CVs are classified into four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The Béta-CoV type contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that sours and rogers play the role of genetic sources for the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reserve of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
To date, seven human coV (HCoV) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The trace of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework to understand the natural history, the motor forces and the restrictive factors of the spread of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the reserve, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future contamination.
Animal CVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated in the respiratory pathways of patients presenting an infection of the upper respiratory tract in 1966, and was then adapted to grow in the WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had classical rhumbism symptoms, including headaches, rashes, malaise and stomachaches, with fever and swelling observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present all over the world, and it seems that they are delivered mainly in winter, in the countries that are under the weather.
The stores in Australia reduce the quantity of paper towels by purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian stores chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase restrictions on two toilet paper and a package per purchase in all stores at the national level, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits were displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the channels' Facebook pages.
The buyers apparently collected reservations due to the COVID-19 and the need to limit themselves.
Mercredi, Woolworths also limited the purchases of toilet paper for domestic delivery to a package by order.
These measures resulted in the previous restriction of four purchase packages introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
In its press release of 8 March, Cole stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, “many stores are always in stock scrapping at the time following delivery”, and he qualified the request for “no previous” while ALDI, in a publication on Tuesday, has qualified for “expected”.
Sales have known a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths speech.
The Costco magazine in Canberra also limited the amount authorized to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce pendulum, Cole ordered larger packages with suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a planned promotion Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of detailaries, stated that the retailers are trying to increase stocks, but the restrictions of the local council on truck delivery time make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to respond to the demand, and less promotions.
Mardi, ALDI announced that after the pre-disposition of stocks, some stores are not able to honor the promotion of mercury.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the department of the distribution of the University of Technology in Queensland, explained that stores resupply stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a volume-based article, resulting in stocks of a reduced quantity that, once exhausted, leaves large open spaces in the radius, strengthening the impression of a pendulum.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [preserved] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic, ” explained Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
Recycling paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were in stock scrap.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent paper, pointed out that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to the article of News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first customer at the time of encherries in Melbourne, while less sales to the encherries were organized because the buyers were missing during the long weekend of the Labour Festival.
The edition of the NT News juju, a daily printed in Darwin, included an eight-page paper to be printed and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia's 3 March report in which they announced that they did not intend to introduce restrictions on purchase.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also knew a strong demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of toilet paper to Andres in two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization qualifies the COVID-19 pandemic
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) qualified the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
While the word "pandemia" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to move governments to action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries fail, try, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations in response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes, the Director-General of WHO.
"We are deeply concerned, not only by alarming levels of propaganda and severity, but also by alarming levels of action."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unforeseen”.
He stated, in a report published by CNN in February, that "in addition to flu, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance to its continued spread worldwide."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never been witnesses of a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added: "And we have never been witnesses of a pandemic that can be mastered at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the epidemic: "The situation will soon end."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a disease epidemic of coronavirus since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, some 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The fertility rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Current symptoms include fever, dizziness and nausea.
The complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory depression syndrome.
The duration between exposure and the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be oscillating between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth, staying away from other people, and monitoring and restricting the suspects to be infected.
The world's authorities have responded by placing restrictions on displacements, quarantines, fires, risk controls on workplaces and plant closures.
The pandemic has generated serious socio-economic disturbances at the global level, the report or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread corruption in the purchases of panic.
Schools and universities have closed to national or local levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against the Chinese, others of Asian origin and appearance in the East and the South-East, as well as other persons from areas where the virus has many cases.
As a result of the decrease in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported an unknown case of pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the large fruit market in Huanan and it is thought that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently and closely linked to the coronaviruses of the souris, the pangolins, and SARS-CoV. Consequently, it was found that the first known person with symptoms was sick on December 1, 2019, and this person had no apparent link with the subsequent release of the precious products market.
In the case of the first page reported in December 2019, the two thirds appeared to have a link with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could be remounted on November 17, 2019, to a 55-year-old person in the province of Hubei. On February 26, 2020, WHO indicated that, as the new cases seemed to decrease in China but gradually increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong sub-assessment of the cases, including those presenting positive symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, 19 years of age and less than 2.4% of cases worldwide.
Cases refer to the number of persons tested at COVID-19 and whose test was confirmed positive under official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those who had only had good symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that in China, up to 23 January, 86 per cent of COVID-19 undetected infections were estimated and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79 per cent of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of the COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Control and Prevention Centres concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people who reach the COVID-19 are in charge.
For those who do not recover, the period between the occurrence of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common is 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been committed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent had preexisting health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official accounts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic refer generally to people who have been tested positive to COVID under official protocols.
The number of actual victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, as it could not include untested people - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partly data from Italy show that the mortality figures during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official estimate of the deaths of COVID.
A U.S. Control and Prevention Centre spokesman (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by the anecdotic evaluation reports to the United States. Such an assessment is often carried out in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed death took place in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death out of continental China occurred on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death out of Asia took place in France on February 14.
On 28 February, out of continental China, more than a dozen countries had been registered in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are widely used to measure mortality.
These figures vary according to the regions and with time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time from the beginning of the epidemic, and demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-law report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the world-class case report is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) by 10 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region.
In China, the incidence of cases reported decreased by 17.3% (for those with symptoms reported between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms reported after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the fertility rate (Letality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who suffer from a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rates), which represents the percentage of people (diagnostics and non-diagnostics) who suffer from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and are followed by a specific population of infection at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the incidence of pandemic infection in its globality is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this sample is consistent with the results of the first COVID-19 randomized tests in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on the estimates of the fertility rate.
WHO claims that pandemics can be controlled.
The peak and the final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and can vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni of the University of State of Pennsylvania stated: "Without control, infectious epidemics generally occur and then start to regress when the disease becomes absent.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when it will occur. ”
The Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries are able to mobilize themselves to follow WHO recommendations on measures to attract the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to move, potentially for a year or two".
According to a study of the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary “until a vaccine is available (in 18 months or more)”.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it passes very easily—disappears completely" and that "it could become a seasonal disease that could be repaired every year."
The virus of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes not specific enough and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry tissue (68%).
The current symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion (mucositis), odorat loss, suffocating, muscle pain and articular pain, stomach pain, headaches, fever, vomiting, haemorrhage, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that about one person over six is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, soda confusion, difficult revelation, and face or blue lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, so researchers have issued recommendations on which persons with close contact with infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of asymptotic ratio range from 44 per cent to 44 per cent.
The normal incubation period (the period between contamination and the occurrence of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people carrying COVID-19 who lost odorat was initially 30% before fall to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is expected to be transmitted mainly through a close contact and by a sweetening end produced by touching, perpetual, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that all without protection can design rubber bottles at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by means of more long-term gouttettes that would remain in the air, which could be designed to be spoken. The respiratory gouttlets can also be designed when breathing, especially when speaking, whatever the virus is not usually airported.
Postillons may fall into the mouth or nose of other persons on the side or even be inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as induction and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) may cause respiratory secretions that are pulverised and thus cause air dispersion.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, especially the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that they can pass through the cells, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China excluded the possibility of a feco-ural transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days following the beginning of symptoms, but the spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
Patients have been tested positive for up to three days prior to the outbreak of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few signs of asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not known exactly how easily the disease spreads, a person is generally infected with two to three others.
In particular, the virus has been detected for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, after one day on the carton, and for four hours on the kitchen.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals were tested positive at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend that they wash their hands after touching animals, such as after contacting other surfaces that infected people may have been affected.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated from three people with pneumonia related to Wuhan’s acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronaviruses that appear in nature. During the human body, the virus is destroyed by the manoeuvre, which breaks down its protective package. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be zoonotic.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, to the subgenerate Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two layers of souri-keys.
It is identical to 96 per cent of the entire gene of another sample of raves-curricular coronavirus (BatCov RATG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of differentiation in some parts of the gene sequences between pangolins and humans.
The comparison of the entire gene showed today a maximum of 92% of the common genetic material between the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection may be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, the final confirmation is carried out by reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scans.
A study comparing the PCR and the scanr in Wuhan suggested that the scanr is much more sensitive than the PCR, which is less accurate, because many of its imagery functions are consistent with other pneumons and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner should not be used for depressing or as a test of first intention to diagnose COVID-19".
The WHO published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first break on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase in real-time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood withdrawals.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinopharynx sampling but it can also be used as a gas removal. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them appeared sufficiently reliable to be approved for general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories alone.
The characteristic imagery elements on the radiographs and tomatosytometry (scan) of the people presenting symptoms include opportunities in asymmetric peripheral depletion and a lack of plural expansion.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently an international online database of confirmed imagery results.
Due to accumulation with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed imagery by PCR is limited to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of the thoracic scanners to the PCR and showed that if the imagery is less precise for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, prioring its consideration as a detection tool in the epidemiological areas.
Convulsive neurons based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the features of the virus in the image both on radiographics and scanners.
The prevention strategies for the transmission of the disease include overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with hands that are not washed, and touching or drying your mouth in a mouse and then throwing the mouse directly into a powder bag.
It was recommended that those who had already been infected carry a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have prohibited or cancelled all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads within the communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how it has been contaminated. Health professionals who are concerned about someone who may be infected with the usual precautions and the precautions of contact, and with the use of protection nets are an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of localization data by governments in this regard has raised confidentiality issues with Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations publishing a communication calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Several mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteers, and by 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on relevant solutions to private life, such as Bluetooth's use to record the presence of a user near other portable phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in contact with someone who has been tested positive to the COVID-19. False ideas are currently moving about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and garnishing with the mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands in order to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often in soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after having been in toilets or when the hands are obviously salty; before eating; and after being tired, tired, or exhausted.
It's because outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by the manoeuvre, which breaks its protective package.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant containing a volume of at least 60 % alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwelcome hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminate in several ways (in a minute of exposure to disinfectant for an stainless steel surface), including ethanol to 62–71%, isopropanol to 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite to 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide to 0.5%, and iodine to 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in a facility as an office furniture or a chair, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, telecoms, and automatic distributors used by sick persons are disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their flat cuts or a bite when they touch or end up, and to throw away all the milk immediately.
The surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the items designed to speak, express, and touch.
The WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at Leeds University, "Bringing a mask can reduce people's property to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hands hygiene."The use of masks has also been prioritised to those who care for a person who is potentially affected by the disease.
The WHO recommended the port of masks for healthy people only if they face an important risk, for example if they are dealing with a disease of COVID-19, even if it recognized that the port of mask can help people not to touch the face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical masks in fabric. China specifically recommended the use of medical masks for healthy people, especially in case of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or in bad places.
In Thailand, the health authorities encourage the population to manufacture and cleanse facial masks at home every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public exits without mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the port of the mask across the world in public places so that everyone would protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone enter a supermarket wears a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to carry a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced tens of millions of masks every day since the middle of the sea, imposed the mask port on train and bus passengers on April 1.
Panama made the port of a mask for all exits, while recommending the manufacture of an artificial mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also called physical distance) includes measures to control infections intended to slow the spread of disease by reducing contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stations, theaters and commercial centres.
Social distance methods can be applied at home, by limiting their journeys, avoiding crowds, by saying hello without contact and by keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social isolation in the regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced by 250 (if there were no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 persons, and later to 10 persons.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and other health agencies, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system, were invited by the CDC to stay home as soon as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by preserving the physical links, or by keeping them alive, as soon as possible.
The use of the term "social distance" should be believed that it was necessary to promote a total social isolation rather than encourage people to keep contact with other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to follow during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation not to have sexual relations with anyone with whom we live, who has no virus or does not present symptoms.
Domestic isolation has been recommended for people with positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended the establishment of individual quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to persons in the most vulnerable groups.
People who have been exposed to COVID-19 disease and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to take place for 14 days from the time they were able to be exposed for the last time.
The control strategies of an epidemic are the beginning or the removal, and the tendon.
The end of the epidemic is introduced in the first stages and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of disease, efforts are being made towards the stage of extinction: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and reduce its effects on the health care system and society.
End-and-to-end measures can be taken at the same time.
The removal requires more extreme measures to focus the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions of less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic consists of trying to suppress the epidemitic peak: this is what is called the spread of the epidemitic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and making time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures such as the hygiene of hands, the port of masks and individual quarantine; public measures of social distance such as the closure of schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of surfaces. More drastic measures to play the epidemic have been taken in China since the severity of the epidemic became apparent, such as the establishment of entire cities and a strict prohibition of travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass testing and localized forty-one missions, and has issued warnings about the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to persons infected in forty years and has affected those who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has penalized the acquisition of medical supplies. The simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that attenuation (the slowing but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and the removal (reversing the development of the epidemic) pose important challenges.
Optimum nutrition policies can reduce the demand for health care of 2/3 and half of deaths, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
The removal may be privileged, but should be continued for as long as the virus moves into the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs first), because in the contrary, the transmission is rapidly renewed when the measures are lifted.
Long-term action to eliminate pandemics has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatments.
Taking medications without order against rhum or consumption of drinks and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Due to pregnancy, oxygenotherapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several components that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently in the study for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO stated that some "traditional and artistic rebirths" may be affected by the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increased capacity and adaptation of health care for patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a key response measure to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines on primary health care care for hospitals and health services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 tests, by canceling emergency interventions where possible, by separating and isolateing patients from COVID-19, and by strengthening the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are several theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new Coronavirus could be remounted on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the market of large sea fruits of Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia feed was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei province hospital, who informed him of the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SRAS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were prosecuted by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was prosecuted by his superiors for giving warning.
The City Health Commission of Wuhan then published a public opinion on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There was enough of an unknown pneumonia reported to the health authorities of Wuhan to launch an investigation early in January. In the first stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by the New Chinese Year’s migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport pool as well as a major railway station.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by displaying the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people were killed and more than 364,000 were killed.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted the movement and place border controls.
National reactions included measures to end up in quarantine (also referred to as orders to stay at home, on site or on border). On April 2, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were subjected to restrictions in the United States, with more than 50 million people confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people in the world knew a form of restraint, a figure rising to 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would be resumed on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown occurrence of pneumonia on 26 December, which she informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on 27 December.
The initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SRAS.
A public opinion was issued by the City Health Commission of Wuhan on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan have received a warning to have "producated rummers" about the epidemic.

This virus may be on the way, and you need to be prepared," adding that good response measures could help the world avoid "the worse".
Ryan then pointed out that current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we accept in absolute that every person on the planet is exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, WHO stated that the Coronavirus epidemic could be qualified as pandemics.
The Director-General indicated that WHO was “very concerned about both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of action”. WHO faced important criticisms regarding its management of pandemic, inadequate judgment, including the late public health declaration and the classification of viruses as pandemic.

Some high Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have rejected the first idea that the Coronavirus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favour of conspiracy theories that the COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has classified the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" coronavirus, saying that in China "the censored a virus now becoming a global pandemic", which has been taxed by some opponents and aimed at "referring to the inability of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast sought a U.S. government telegram exposing the major lines of a communication strategy apparently from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: "All comes from China.

Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders to ask for assistance on 14 March 2020 indicating that his country was in a bad condition to fight the epidemic because of lack of access to international markets for United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic caused appeals to the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, a paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election during the presidential election in 2020. The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.

This has also resulted in a decrease in individual protection equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that it will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for customers to sell Australian products in China.
Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and in the Wuhan region and the strong demand for food that followed, these two areas were separated by severe food shortages.

Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to restrictions on movement, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of governments against all travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Kantas, while British Regional Air Company Flybe failed.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway cars and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving important groups have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's annual festivals, and private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass assemblies, including the banate City of Beijing and the times of the traditional temple.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the holidays of the New Year until 10 February, imposing on most of the jobs not to work before that date.
These regions represented 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has passed to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared a state of emergency, shutting down schools until March and canceling its New Year's festivals. The distribution sector has been affected at the global level, with reduced hours of opening of shops or temporary closures.
Visits to traders in Europe and Latin America have decreased by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders found a drop of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a decrease of 33 to 43 per cent of Pietton traffic in commercial centres in March compared to February.
The operators of commercial centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequency, the installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America with regard to a situation without pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the 300 million rural migrant workers were detained in the interior provinces or in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for help from the government.
The Coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The restriction in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily salary) in unemployment. Angus Reid Institute observed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced some type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the restriction imposed on mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment allowance, and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies have turned their salaries into a partial operating device subsidised by the government called Kurzlab.
The German temporary work compensation device was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The arts sectors of the exhibition and cultural heritage were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent, at the global level.
Art and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition halls and other cultural institutions have been closed to the new order and their exhibitions, events and reports.
In response, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated impact on disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other social events, such as music and concerts, technological conferences and fashion failures.
The film industry also experienced a interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place the last week of the Christian period of imprisonment in Careme, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Mass; some churches spread their religious services to radio, online and online, or television while others propose to practice their religion in the "run-in".
At the instigation of the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome who closed his churches and the chapels and the place Saint-Pierre which was seen by all his Christian pilgrims, other religious authorities also canceled their services and limited public assemblies in the churches, mosques, churches, temples and shrines.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to the sacred sites of La Mecque and Médine.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption of the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sports events have been cancelled or reported, including the EUFA 2019-20 Championships League, the 2019-20 Football Championship, the EUFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 LNH season.
The epidemic disturbed the organisation of the 2020 Olympic Games, which was to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but not later than the 2021 summer". Casinos and other world-wide games facilities have closed and live poker tournaments have been reported.
This has prompted many players to sign up online, and many online games sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups that have suspended or cancelled their concert tournaments.
Many great theaters, such as those in Broadway, have also interrupted all their representations.
Some artists have searched for ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in exchange for traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online "festivals" for artists to produce, disseminate and promote their works.
Online, many online games on the topic of coronavirus have been promoted because many prefer humor and distraction to uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, a recruitment of victims, xenophobia and racism has been found to people of Chinese and Asian origin, and to persons from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Threats to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Pacific region.
Reports from February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in various groups across the world that the Chinese merit the virus or receive justified punishment.
Some African countries have also found an increase in anti-Chinese feelings.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the progression of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, Italians living in the first European country to undergo a serious COVID-19 epidemic could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of such countries as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have at first signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries to stop the disease.
In Japan, #ChinaDontComeToJapan has become a terrorist on Twitter.
The Chinese as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in racist levels of insults and aggression.
American President Donald Trump faced the criticism of qualifying the "Chinese virus" coronavirus, a term considered by its tractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, demonstrators attacked Ukrainian buses and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Indigenous students from the North-East India, who share a border with China, and studying in large Indian cities would have been in contact with the Coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the Bengal-Occidental Unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese had destroyed the nature and "that is why God took his vengeance on them".
The notes were subsequently condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, who described them as "fausses". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese people were attended by the pandemic, while foreigners were described as "foreign wastes" which should be "removeable".
Many journals of access to pay have withdrawn them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors have made their scientific articles available in connection with the epidemic in free access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on public servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the Aaron of Coronavirus.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the ARN of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too light to be reported or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of total immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variable is likely to significantly affect the reported fertility rates, which are likely to be significantly higher in some countries.
By using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using a variety of methods, including nasopharingic ecuvilon or exploration sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharyngous chovelons is only valid during the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the gorge while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In the infected persons tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in deep respiratory pathways by breathing catheter, or a crack (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 through an inverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), which was the basis of 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean Kogenebiotech company developed a SARS-CoV-2 clinical-based clinical-quality kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the “E” gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and RdRP specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the authorisation of the emergency use of the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR.In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, distribute their diagnostic equipment by RT-PCR in real time of the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Response.
Among the ancient versions of the test kits, a genetic test on three was obtained inconclusive results due to defective reactivities, as well as an extraterrestrial test hole in Atlanta's CDC. Consequently, less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and that is only when federal and local laboratories received permission to start the investigation.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation.The US commercial laboratories began the investigation at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced availability at the national level of COVID-19-based tests based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. The collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre for virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervisory Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was announced to have developed an infection detection test at COVID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA authorization for a test that could be performed in large quantities at 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4 128 tests at 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted Abbott Laboratories an emergency authorisation for a test on the system m2000 of Abbott. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hholic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepidhe also received an FDA US for a 45-minute test.
The FDA approved a test using isothermal isotherm amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibodies specifically related to the nucleopside protein (Protein N) of the new Coronavirus is currently under development in Taiwan, hoping that it can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as a quick flu test.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that “pulmonary radiographs present a low diagnostic value at the first stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometer] can be finalized even before symptoms appear. ”
Among the typical symptoms visible on the TDM are barriers to multi-lobular bilateral depletion with peripheral, asymmetric and post-mortem distribution.
A sub-pleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and consolidation develops as the disease develops.
A study comparing the PDR to the WUhan TDM, at the beginning of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, several of its imagery results coincided with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. Radiology College recommends that "the TDM should not be used for testing or as a first line test for diagnosis of COVID-19".In March 2020, CDCs recommend the PCR for initial testing.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and in the context of population monitoring.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by test at the patient’s head (point of-of-care testing, PoCT).
The high-cost automated systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For the TLC, only peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For the PCT, one single blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR methods, no phase of extraction is required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities who were duly informed of the agency and who can therefore now distribute their anti-corporate testing tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation.In March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is much faster than the viral Arn PCR test.
The antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the beginning of the infection.In April, the United Kingdom found that none of the tests for antibodies purchased by the country were sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has set up a plan in which suspects can stay in their home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with an sample tube", patients who fear inside, send it and later receive the test results.The British NHS announced that it is carrying out a pilot project to test suspects at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient does not have an infection with others by getting into a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the COVID-19 survey framework for suspects, a health professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The driving centres allowed South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most expensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Obligatory Health Doctors stated on 2 March that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests per day in the hospital, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160 000 tests per week.
On March 19th, tests were available in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at the 12/20th calendar week, a total of 483,295 samples were tested until the 12/2020 week, and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) were obtained positive results for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of 64 patients at the same time, combining samples and not following the analysis that if the combined sample showed positive.
With its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the BGI founder, the modelling showed that the cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the cost of implementation in quarantine would have been doubled without such detection capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 Chinese cities.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was up to 50,000 tests per day.The free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 samples of patients for the COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid-handling robots.
In March, insufficient amounts of reactors and wastes became an extraordinary hole for mass dumping in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has prompted some authors to examine the preparation protocols of samples that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes to continue the investigation.On 31 March, it was announced that the Arab Emirates were currently testing most of their population per capita for Coronavirus, and it was about to intensify the dumping to reach the majority of the population.
These results have been obtained through a combination of the ability to drive and purchase a high-cost laboratory with Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to run tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Various test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to produce kits sent to low-income countries without the resources needed to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centres was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to respond to the request and recommendations of health professionals.
In contrast, experts point out that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
The deployment capacity, mostly in the private sector laboratories, has been strengthened for several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of research programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The strong demand for tests due to the wide spread of the virus has led to the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the United States' private laboratories, and the reserves of eco-fuels and chemical reactions have been exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, test kits developed by the CDC were "debts". The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private tests.Spain purchased test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be related to the inability to collect samples or to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the kits that gave the wrong results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have given false results.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they should be cast into the Danube. Atesh Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced early April 2020 that they were useless.
The survey, followed by a quarter of those who received a positive result and the people who were in contact with the SARS-CoV-2 ports, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the place of the first death associated with the COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the total population of approximately 3,400 people, at about ten days of interval.
Nearly half of the people receiving a positive result did not have symptoms, and all the cases discovered were in quarantine.
With the restriction of displacement in the community, this measure completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive traceability of contacts, the restrictions on entry travel, testing and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail sales facilities.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun to advise residents to stay at them on 28 March, but schools have run to the date scheduled for the end of the holidays on 23 March.
A number of other countries have also managed the pandemic with the help of aggressive traffic, restrictions on entry, landing and quarantine travel, but with less aggressive restrictions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has found that countries that have performed most of the tests, compared to the number of deaths, have a much lower fertility rate, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people who are not presenting mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries with no capacity to analyse and that national laboratories have only a limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to carry out confirmation tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the 'Possibility in % of tests' column depends on the national testing policy.
A country that does not test that people admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all of the citizens, whether they present or not symptoms, the other factors are the same.
Washing hands, also called hands hygiene, is necessary to clean your hands in order to remove salts, fats, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-focal route.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rhumme, for example, by washing hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (e.g. mucus).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day: before and after the defecation, after cleaning the dishes of a baby or changing its legs, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processed meat, fish or cross birds.
If you do not have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands in the fire. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after preparation of meals;
before and after the appointment of a sick person;
after changing the shoes of a baby or cleaning a child who is taken to toilets;
after being moved or touched/externated;
after touching an animal, food for animals or waste of animal origin;
Medical hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or producing medical care may prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic agents (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reduction in influenza spread, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of respiratory infections; reduction of respiratory infections;
as well as reducing infant mortality rates at home.
According to a study conducted in 2013, improving manual hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple practice may reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by about 50%.
The implementation of actions to promote hand washing could reduce approximately one third of the diarrhoea episodes, a figure comparable to that obtained by drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands with soap allows a 48% reduction in diarrhoea episodes and is the most effective and least cost of preventing acute diarrhoea and respiratory infections (IRA). It is an act that must be done automatically in the homes, schools and communities of the world.
The pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the first cause of death in children under five years of age, which is about 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia lead to the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to toilets can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reducing almost half the deaths from diarrhoea and one quarter of the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is generally associated with other health measures in water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The washing of hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
The minor decelerate effect, the frequent washing of hands can burn the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive washing of hands could lead to exacema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by skin rash and dementia, and particularly frequent in health workers.
The excessive washing of hands is also considered to be one of the symptoms of the complex obsessive disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key times a day to reduce oro-focal transmission of diseases: before and after using toilets (mixing, defecation), after cleaning a baby's feet (or changing its legs), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling from meat, fish or cross-flake.
It is also necessary to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after the treatment of a cut or injury, after being injured, injured or mutilated, after touching animal or manipulating animals and after touching orders.
In many countries, the clean-up rate of soap is low.
According to a study carried out in 2015 in 54 countries and involving the hygiene of hands, 38.7% of the average household was washed with soap. A 2014 study showed that in Saudi Arabia the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China was the lowest level (23%). There are now several methods to develop behaviors and democracise the use of soap for washing hands at key times of the day. In particular, in developing countries, it is possible to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "primary Health Programme" to promote children's health and education.
The elimination twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands to the soap and brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothbrush, is at the heart of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In order to improve the elimination of the microorganisms present on the skin, it is necessary to increase knowledge or access to water.
The main action of knowledge and determinants is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase solubility.
The water alone is not an effective clean skin, given that lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of the soil, are difficult to solve in the water.
However, adequate water consumption facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can confirm bacteria derived from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap found that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were reversible with the mouse.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicates that "automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable".
Antibacterial knowledge has been strongly recommended for people concerned with their health status.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants allows the target of antibiotics resistant to the environment.
However, antibacterial knowledge contains current antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many bodies resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotics resistant strains are not the product of antibacterial knowledge, the latter could not be as effective as they were announced.
In addition to the stress-active and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) that are used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menhol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the Public Health School of the University of Oregon indicated that regular knowledge was as effective as antibacterial knowledge for individuals and containing triclosan, in order to prevent diseases and eliminate manic bacteria.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster to body temperature (37 °C).
However, fresh water and soapy water is more effective than cold water and soapy water to eliminate natural salts and bacteria from natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of hot water did not contribute to reducing the microbial load on hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a hygiene product of non-aqueous hands.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the twenty-first century, non-alcoholic hygiene products (now called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hands disinfectants) began to popularize.
Most are formulated based on isopropylic alcohol or ethanol associated with an agent that exhibits such carbon (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or to a inhibitor such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or muscle for a greater ease of use and to reduce the effects of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% of alcohol effectively eliminate the breasts.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as champagne.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% of alcohol eliminate 99.97% (deduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.The disinfectants for the hands are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contaminated gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to wash or cover both hands well.
The foam and the two hands and the interstices between the fingers and the needles should be faced for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, mouse or dry gel is removed.
The American Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends washing hands rather than using hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visible.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace a proper washing of hands unless you have water and water.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to skin impairment if the formula is not strengthened by embolides and/or skin hydrating agents.
The acidant effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing embolants have been significantly lower in irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial known known known or rare.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or alcohol hypersensitive or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritant contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands in water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-adjusted products do not eliminate the organic materials present on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, the disinfectants for hands are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formula used for benzalkonium chloride has presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which is expected after repeated use, probably due to progressive hepatic impairment.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who use more than the land or land.
The earth or the earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than they know.
What is more, if land or land is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of brakes.
At the start of the soap, the powder is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends cutting or sand as an alternative to knowledge when it is not available.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you wash your hands properly in order to prevent the transmission of diseases, following the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the temperature of the water does not seem to differ).
To move a generous amount of soap on their hands by fraving them against each other, without forgetting the two hands, between the fingers and under the legs.
The soap removes the skins of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when they use salt than water alone.
Flotter for at least 20 seconds.
The process of frying creates friction, which helps to eliminate the seeds of the skin, and for a longer time it takes more seeds to be removed.
Rincher enough to run into the current water.
Retaliation in a steaming water basin can lead to the retina of hands.
Safe with a private service or free air.
Washing hands and wet hands are more easily retweeted.The most often forgotten areas are the dust, the poignet, the between the fingers and the bottom of the needles.
Artificial angles and narrow angle angles may cause microorganisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin injuries that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when the water of the robinet and/or soap is not available. For example, to cool water from a suspended or dry stomach and/or waste it if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "type-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a cord, and a pedal that allows to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hands hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss it.
More and more research suggests that paper services are much more hygienic than electrical dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the entire paper industry, the European Tessue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London) to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper services, hot air dryers and hot air dryers to more modern air.
After washing and drying hands in hot air dry hands, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by 194 per cent on the lungs and 254 per cent on the lungs.
The drying of dry hands in air resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the milk powder of 42 per cent and on the 15 per cent pumas.
After washing and drying the hands with a paper service, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76 per cent on the powder and up to 77 per cent on the lungs.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the environment of toilets according to each drying method.
The air-to-air dryer, which breathes from the air out of the device at the speeds announced at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling the micro-organisms of the hands and the device and possibly contamination of other toilet users, as well as the environment of toilets in a perimeter up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air dryer allows micro-organisms to be deployed at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the dryer.
The paper services revealed that there was no significant proliferation of micro-organisms. In a study conducted by TÜV Product and Environment, different hand drying methods were evaluated in 2005.
After hand drying, the following changes in the bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different hand mill manufacturers, and hand mills have been compared to drying using paper services.
Washing hands with disinfectant lips is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that send reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
A study revealed that their use resulted in a reduction in the rates of infection.
The medical washing of hands must take at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to move and freeze each part of the hands.
The hands must be broken against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the needles, it is possible to use a dust brush to remove them.
As the seeds present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to swim well and try with a clean service.
After drying, the paper service must be used to close the robinnet (and open the exit door if appropriate).
This helps to prevent the retracement of the hands in contact with surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("brothers") and to avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions, a large number of doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which contributes to the transmission of micro-organisms.
According to one study, the correct washing of hands and monitoring of other simple procedures can reduce 66% of the rate of catheter-related blood infections. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and washing hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on the hygiene of hands established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from the Internet.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
Devices available in the trade may measure and confirm the hygiene of hands if compliance with the regulation is observed.
The World Health Organization defines "Fifq indicators" relating to the hygiene of hands:
after exposure to blood/a biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
after contact with the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (such as "medical" or "antimicrobials") seeks to the washer of the hands a germ destruction action.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotics resistant organisms are very rare. To "frott" their hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a robot that can be opened and closed without touching hands, a chlorhexidin-based or iodic-based washing product, sterile services to hide the hands after having washed them, a sterile brush to freeze and another sterile instrument to clean under the needles.
All the bees must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and feet up to your knees, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't need to shake your hands for 10 minutes.
In the spring, it must be avoided that water on the front of the trees does not reach their hands.
Once your hands are washed, you need to wash your hands with a sterile line and fill a surgical bag.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after being treated by a sick person.
With regard to monitoring of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of washing hands were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there was only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of washing hands more than 35%.
If you compare the washing of hands with a regular shower with an antibacterial soap, the rate of infectious bacterial diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing the washing of hands with an alcohol-based solution and washing of hands with an antibacterial soap for an average period of 30 seconds each, it is found that the first reduction in bacterial contamination is 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A (H1N1) virus (H1N1) and the difficult steps of Clostridium on hands. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care facilities, it is possible to train personnel in hand washing, to increase the provision of alcohol-based products and to address written and verbal reminders on this subject.
Further research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, it is considered that the washing of hands in soap is a small cost-effective and essential tool to preserve health, that is to eat properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soaps or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal health standards.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find robots to wash their hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hands washing stations.
However, the low wash rate of hands can also be imputable to heavy habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
The promotion of sensitization and awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, make known the benefits associated with this practice and bring about a long-term change in behavior among the population.
In order to achieve this objective, follow-up and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic examination of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective to increase the rate of hand washing in low-income and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. As regards the promotion of hand washing in schools, the example of UNICEF 's ' three-star approach ', which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, despite other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the manual health promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Hand Washing is another example of awareness campaign that aims to promote behavioral development.After the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emegio to illustrate hand washing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness report of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of years of healthy life (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap washing is much more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health, in particular for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers coming from hospitals or injured soldiers, was identified for the first time in the middle of the 19th century by two pioneers of the hands hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing care" in Britain.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetish-like haters.
In the 1980s, foodborne epidemics and nocomamal infections led the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further promote the hygiene of hands as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The presence of porcine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, exhibitions depicting the "good hand washing techniques" have been placed on the side of bars in public toilets and in office furniture and airports.
The expression “to wash your hands ” refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complicated by something.
It is derived from a Bible verse by Matthew in which Ponce Pilate washes the hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but this expression has been widely expressed in some English communities.
In Macbeth, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in a complex way to try to clean up an imaginary burden, a symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she committed and that she urged her husband to commit.
It has also been observed that some people, after being remembered to commit acts contrary to ethics or to consider doing so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and give more value to manual washing devices.
In addition, those who are authorized to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to deliver to other compensating measures of "cleaning" such as the volunteer.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the washing rituals of hands laid down in many religions, including baisism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual washing of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the washing of hands in Christianism and the wadhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe washing hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to toilets.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace
The COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace refer to the implementation of health and safety methodologies at work for control of the risk of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls on the workplace vary according to the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the individual risk factors of the workers that could be harmful to an infection by COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest exposure risk employment has a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic anti-infection prevention measures are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay home if they are ill, respiratory label, and maintaining a cleaning and routine of the working environment.
Average exposure risk employment includes those that require frequent or secret contacts with persons without suspected or known COVID-19 but may be infected by a current Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume detailed environments.
Risk controls in this group, as well as basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, hygiene valves and the provision of an individual protection equipment in case of encountering an infected person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers the health and funeral workers exposed to people with a suspected COVID-19, or known as a high exposure risk, to be at a very high risk if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or removals or manipulations of samples of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
The COVID-19 epidemics can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they are sick, have to take care of other people or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models can change, both in terms of goods and means of acquisition (including out-of-point or use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of articles from geographical regions seriously affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, family and community-related risk factors and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also challenge the controls necessary to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may result from the epidemics.
The preparation and response plans for infectious diseases can be made subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining commercial operations and reducing the adverse effects on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the enterprise is located affects the answers applied.
The risk control hierarchy is a framework that is widely used in health and safety at work in order to group risk controls effectively.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, administrative controls and individual protection equipment.
Technical controls involve the isolation of workers from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers. They can be the most economic solution to implement them.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the employer or employer.
The individual protection equipment (IPI) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent some exposure.
All types of IPI must be selected according to the risk to the worker, properly adapted according to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically carried, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced by the requirements, and properly withdrawn, cleaned and stored or stored to avoid any contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest exposure risk employment has a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and minute washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory label, including covering the mouth and nose to swallow and swallow, providing infants and people, preparing the television or working hours at the required time, encouraging workers to use the tools and equipment of others and maintaining the cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected persons constitutes a crucial step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others at a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees present symptoms of respiratory disease be able to stay at home until they are no longer fever, fever signs or any other symptoms have been present for at least 24 hours without using fever or other medicines on the symptoms, and they also recommend applying flexible disease congenital policies, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a family member of the disease and inform the employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, average exposure risk employment includes those who require frequent or close contact, at least six feet (1.8 m) of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but who may be infected by SARS-COV-2 by a Community transmission around the company’s headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip in a region with a COVID-19 reversible transmission.
This includes workers in contact with large public workers, including in schools, high population density working environments, and some high-frework environments and some high-fly high-fly high-s high-fows. Technical and high-level technical and high- and high-risk frameworks include the installation of high-quality air filters and high-efficient air filters and high air flow flow flow flow rate, increased ventilation flow rates, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastics, and the installation of a window running window for customer service customer service services. Administrative controls for this group and the highest-high-high-high-high-high-high-s high-s high-level working environments, and high-high-high-high-s high quality quality quality standards, including high-high-high quality quality quality standards, including high-care quality standards for workers in working environments, high quality quality quality quality quality, the quality quality quality of physical training, the quality quality level of physical training, the quality of work at work at work, and quality quality quality quality quality, the quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality, and quality quality quality, the quality quality quality quality quality, the quality quality quality, quality in quality in quality, quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality, and quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality, quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality, quality quality, quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality quality
The workers of this risk group are rarely required to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls sick on board a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: to separate the disease from others by a distance of 6 feet, to designate a member of the crew to deal with the disease and to offer a protection mask to the patient or to ask him to cover his mouth and nose with the help of the mouse when he or she goes away or goes away.
The cabin crew must carry stable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or with potentially contaminated organic liquids or surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the patient is exposed to fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
The gloves and other solid articles must be collected in a bag intended for dangerous biological wastes and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include the report of the travel in case of disease, as well as the auto-insole and immediate information of the medical centre if it is developed once a fever or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical follow-up must take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For school facilities and child care, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has become in a school building, regardless of the community propaganda.
In the case of moderate minimum Community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of pedagogical exits, assemblies and other important assemblies such as physical education courses or choirs or canteen meals, increasing the space between offices, reducing hours of arrival and exit, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate nurse for children with flu symptoms.
In the case of important transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, an extension of school vacations may be considered. For the forces of order carrying out routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDC.
Officials of the order forces who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the port of adequate individual protection equipment.
In the event of close contact during a arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service station before re-use using a language or spray will be able to manage and follow the standard procedures for the removal and release of used EPIs, as well as the cleaning and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to belong to high or very high exposure risk categories.
High exposure risk employment includes health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
They become very high-risk exposure workers if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or removals or manipulations of samples of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include induction, induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure funerals include workers who are involved in preparing bodies of persons with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they are at a very high risk of exposure if they practice an autopsy. The additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolate rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including in the implementation of aerosol production procedures.
A specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral environments.
Samples must be manipulated using Level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients enter separate waiting rooms depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons working at least 6 feet of patients with suspected or known infection by SARS-COV-2 and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filter respiratory masks approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a full and written respiratory protection programme, including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide higher protection and better comfort to the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
The WHO does not recommend the port of a surgical mask except by the entrance staff.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol production procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective moons or facial screen, blue and yellow.
In case of aerosol production, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of EPI is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a location occupied by a patient COVID-19 to those directly involved in its care, the use of the EPIs required for the specific task alone, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without withdrawing it from taking several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the EPI supply chain and the dissuasation of the use of masks for symptomatic individuals.

We find this month in an exceptional situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response depends on the type of empathy, cooperation and community-building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and kindness that we have observed among all our colleagues in the e-mails, calls and interviews are a remarkable testimony of the incredible human beings with whom we have the opportunity to work.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud of everyone to count on you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone gave me his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the present time, and the strong symbol is the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible because of your work, which keeps you operational sites, ensures the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
In view of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will proceed to subsequent adjustments in the way we work together from next week.
Changes in our work and our time
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our time employment in the days and months to come.
During this discussion, we considered what would be an appropriate response to the situation we face and the best way to ensure the organization's viability during this period.
First, we had to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take a break, don't worry.
To all staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily work schedule will be approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the new order.
We will not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the present time, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, take courses or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we say it.
No sickness leave or leave payment required: simply prevent your superior and help your team review the schedules and time jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are positive in COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from T&amp;C Ops from helping you and ensure that your situation gets the necessary attention from the direction).
The hourly staff will be paid in full.
We have already announced it, and we will renew our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our under-trainers and fellow members of the time staff.
The world will be paid on the basis of its usual working hours carried out under normal conditions.
That's true if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use the work as a means to relieve their stress in the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly grateful, especially during periods like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what to expect and have the necessary provisions.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops RH, Trust &amp; and the Funding Collection (including others) teams carry out essential work that might need to be strengthened.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and concentrate on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There's enough work for each of us, we're just going to focus on the most important projects.
Slowing now won't do any harm later.
We do not intend to "work twice more to save lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to make additional hours to respect the times now unrealistic.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new goals and if necessary.
What about the PPP (Annual Planning) ?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the goals of working time daily, we plan to adjust the scenario for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which requires more time to set up a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, care for themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or wish to see their working hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of the stages significantly reduces the load of work and the pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and teams of the next steps of confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, presentation and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great caution, we have called on an antiviral cleanup team to disinfect all the surfaces of San Francisco's office.
They used a hospital-quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator boxes leading to our station.
The building has applied its own protocol to the duty to use products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared with us and all of the staff members based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As the knowledge of some of our colleagues established in New York, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continued but could be updated.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our colleagues who are accustomed to remote work know that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings at meetings at a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider distributing them for several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have a agenda and send documentation ahead.
Make videos of the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage direct collaboration and exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help you take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable cache.
Use your well-being refund for the collatings.
Join the #removes channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The RH Operation Team studies ergonomic guidelines based on web sites to support increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimédia, such as the edition-a-thon, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We have explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed subsidization activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delay or change of these objectives.
The following week, we will publish additional directives on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be at the same time in the face of confusion and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikipedia and others.
As a result, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and to continue our communication with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will be invited to your calendars for an extraordinary meeting of the next Thursday staff, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns all of us, and we are here to help you in any way possible.
From here, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other important information related to the COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with members of staff living in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about displacements, events, important workflows or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We're here to support you and ensure that the connection happens.
For any confidential or sensitive issue, please send an e-mail to Bryan Juden, Director of International Global Operations RH.
None of these changes should be considered as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
It is contrary to the fact that at the present time, our work and our obligations will likely have to be adapted in an unprecedented manner.
These are the steps that we consider necessary to support us on a mutual basis and to continue our work, to provide us with the help we need, and to provide the world with the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be there to wait for the time has come.
For the moment, it is time to get in and prepare for important work that will take place in the weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need each of you to get there, so you need to keep and take care of your family so that you can give the best of your own time.
Finally, if you like, wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b The enzyme for conversion of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme associated with the external (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 is against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and by increasing Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising medical target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is often designated as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metalluenic enzyme containing zinc in the endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 terminal peptidase domain N and a renal amino acid congenital collection area C.
ACE2 is a single-passed membrane of type I, whose active area on the enzyme level is exposed to the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
ACE2's extracellular area is closed from the trans-membrainary area by another enzyme called sheddas; the solvent resulting from it is released in the blood flow and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related to the primary cell membrane of type II pulmonary albumin cells, erytherosity of the intestinal intestine, arterial endothelial and venous cells and blood cells of most organs.
The expression of the ANNm of ACE2 is also present in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and cerebral throne.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate for the ACE.
The ACE detects angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II vasoconstrictive.
The ACE2 is subjected to angiotensin carboxylic acid (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator 1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also detect several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykine, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greline.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane movement of the sodium carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup’s disease.
ACE2 is the primary entry point in certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus in the origin of SRAS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus in the origin of COVID-19).
More specifically, the combination of S1 S1 spicule protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in the ACE2 enzyme domain on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and in both transfer of the virus and enzyme in endosomals within cells.
This entry process also requires the introduction of protein S by the TMPRSS2 serum host protein, the inhibition of this latter is currently being carried out as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 rates in cells can contribute to the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard treatment be continued with the assistance of the ACE and ARB inhibitor.
A systematic and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of ECE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to witness subjects."
In addition, "pneumonia risk has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitor who presented a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular AVC victims and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were lower than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Angiotensin 2 recombinant human enzyme (rhACE2) is present as innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and seems to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the porcelains with acute respiratory depression syndrome caused by lipolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes more than the duration of effect (long) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggested that rhACE2 could be a promising medicine for people with a history of intolerance to classical inhibitors of the renal angiotensin system (SRA) or for patients with a high circulation of angiotensin II. rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory depression.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the trace of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons likely to be contacted with an infected individual.
Several applications have been developed or proposed, with official support from the Government on certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been put in place for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the traceability of the geographical location of applications users, raise questions about respect for private life.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record the presence of a user with other portable phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems with a functionality that enables them to handle these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese Government, in association with Aragawa, has launched an application in China that allows citizens to verify whether they have been contacted with the people of the COVID-19 port.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has, as far as it is concerned, chosen for a app named TraceTogether.
Having been developed by a local information community, it has been provided with an open source and will be released to the Government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!" a Bluetooth application that ensures the traceability of exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicates with the health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
From April 14, 2020, the application was pending approval by Google Play Store and App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was at an advanced development stage and could be deployed over the coming weeks. A similar application was planned in Ireland and France (‘StopCovid’).
Australia and New Zealand intend to place applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a geoperation application for patients who are presenting a COVID-19 diagnosis and resident in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, mentioned several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including the poor positive and the lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" bodies or generally worthy of confidence to add applications related to coronavirus to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
In order to protect private life, the combatants were concerned about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass monitoring, in particular the possible dementia of the surveillance infrastructure created to face the Coronavirus pandemic once and for all.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have established eight conditions for compliance in the framework of government projects:
Monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extension of control and monitoring should include exclusion clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a manner that is demonstrable;
digital monitoring should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the Law;
protection against abuse and abuse of citizens should be provided;
The "significant participation" of all "the stakeholders concerned" would be mandatory, including those of public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Borderless Reporter (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published verification lists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the continued monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices until it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a system of geologicization instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid traceability.
In Israel, network traffic has been approved.
The network solutions that have access to gross geologicization data present important potential problems with respect to private life.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need to access personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for communication, which allows private life to be respected (see below).
In South Korea, a system not based on an application has been used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system has collected trace information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transactions, which have subsequently been associated with sending SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the Government has also made information on the location available to the public, which has been permitted following the profound changes to the law on the protection of the confidentiality of information after the MERS epidemic that affected this country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralised systems for private life.
Details have not yet been reported on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of contacts respecting private life is a well-defined concept, based on a large volume of research data from 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on solutions respecting private life, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other portable phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that is associated with centralised and decentralised approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include Decentralised Privacy-Conserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, previously called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identification personal data are never left on the device and that all correspondence is carried out on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of private life conservation techniques in the collection and use of location or contact data in order to follow the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the book «Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic» published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops private life-protection technologies originally based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses safe material technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a key common approach and protocols to reduce fragmentation and ensure the global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a communication tracking initiative, saying it would save private life and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a cryptography that ensures confidentiality.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications in respect of private life
Direct integration of this functionality in iOS and Android. Google and Apple are planning to address the problems of the adoption of the solution and the persistence of monitoring by initially distributing the system through up-to-date deployment and by removing it from the operating system once and for all.
The repositioning of a medicine (also referred to as reorientation, reprofilation, rehabilitation or change in therapeutic indication of a medicine) refers to the conversion of a medicine approved for a disease or for a different medical condition for which it was originally developed.
This is a research area currently under study to develop safe and effective treatment against COVID-19.
Other research activities include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfer of plasma by convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 presents approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several linkage sites.
The analysis of these linkage sites offers the developmentist project of effective antiviral medicine against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the protein of the type Papain, the Arn polymerase Arn dependent, the helicase, the S protein and the ADP phosphatase.
Hussein A A, and al. studied several selected candidates who then optimized and analysed to determine their structural similarity with the most approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 medicinal product in their pre-clinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the apparent chlorquin and hydrochloric acid would be part of the four drugs studied in the clinical trial of Solidarity.
The New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24th. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the U.S. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalised patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "use, dose or duration of hydrochloricine administration for the prevention or treatment of infection with SARS-COV-2" has not yet been established.
Doctors have indicated that this medicine is used "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School carries out a test on the safety and efficacy of the prevention of hydrochloricine use.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have confirmed that favipiravir was clearly effective.
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative for a mean period of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients suffering from pneumonia, half of the patients received favipinavir and the other half of the imfenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the evidence in favour of the medicinal product is minor and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine in Japan for its reserves and use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to care for patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe opened opportunities for Trump administration to buy the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to progress.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that “no benefit has been observed”.
These medicines have been designed to inhibit the replication of HIV related to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these medicines to find a component that would be related to SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the special treatment of HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
The armdexivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences such as the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences then discovered that the armdesivir had an in vitro antiviral activity against severalfilviruses, pneumonia, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to the trial suggested that reddecivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one with people suffering from moderate pathology and the other with more serious forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalised and severely ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials on azathromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) provides for a clinical trial on the alvesco (cyclosonide) of Teijin, a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
An angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme test is ongoing with 200 patients to recruit among the severe hospitalised cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who have been diagnosed positively with COVID-19 and presents moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective contraception method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
The low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients and the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the recovery of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for prior epidemics such as MERS, SRAS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many development attempts are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, viruses originating in the disease, at least 18 months ago.
In April, five vaccine candidates were conducting phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic has been reported worldwide in 2020, leading to significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, ECPI's initiatives for the development of a vaccine are speeding up, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, ECI scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms held research and development projects in early 2020 in order to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform carried out in phase I security studies include:
Nuclear acid (ADN and ARN) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenoviral vector type 5)
As told by ECI scientists in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are at the first stages of development, 78 (79 after the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other announced, but with few public information available (presumed during planning or design).
A phase I-II preliminary safety and immunogenicity test is usually randomized, controlled against placebo and carried out in several centres all by determining more accurate doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a group of witnesses, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in the prevention of disease, while monitoring the adverse effects on the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human person assessment phase (pre-clinical research).
About 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it studied the potential of a molecular penis vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced that it had begun to work on a vaccine, whose human tests should begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced that they had started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a similar technology like that of neoantic vaccination used for cancer treatment.

The partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in an accelerated procedure, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, indicated that a similar part of the Coronavirus was developed through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is currently in laboratory research, testing on human beings is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, Guardian announced that American President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a strong amount of money to obtain exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19", which led to the protest of the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an ARNm-based vaccine.
The vaccine candidate based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in preclinical test phase with the beginning of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Tákis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the test on the man of its final vaccine candidate could begin at the end of the day.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in the Preparation of Epidemics (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a vaccine research venture against COVID-19 including the Institute of Pastor, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing ECPI's total investment in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other ECPI investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started tests on the animals of six different vaccine candidates.
The researchers of the Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a vaccine in Arn self-amplifier against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of sending the sequence by China.
By the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $275 million funding for 96 research projects on drug countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At the same time, the Government of Canada announced the office of $192 million devoted to the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 with projects to create a national vaccine bank containing several new vaccines that could be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, medical researchers at Pittsburgh University indicated that PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against the COVID-19 in rats, stated that “the SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine sub-units administered by microaguillas resulted in an important response of the anticancer specific antibodies observed 2 weeks after immunization”.
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a vaccine candidate based on DNA in the potential form of a nasal spray.
With the help of bacteria, DNA will be designed to adapt to human bacteria to produce infectious particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud-based information resources.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can provide benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another survey in Australia includes 4,170 health professionals.
It is possible that the vaccines in the course of development are not safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using specific animal models in COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 rats, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates the need to implement biosafety measures at level 3 for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protection vaccine against SRAS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAS was a priority for governments and health agencies worldwide.There is no vaccine tested against MARS.
When MARS re-examined, it was thought that existing research on SRAS could serve as a model for the development of vaccines and medicines against an infection with MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, only one vaccine against the METS (based on DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were ongoing; all vaccines were viral vectors, two adneviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have published a theory of the conclusion that the virus in the origin of the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social networks publications refer to existing patents containing genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SRAS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Current symptoms include fever, dizziness and nausea.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, stomach pain, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The duration between exposure and the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be oscillating between two and fourteen days.
While most cases lead to moderate symptoms, some develop to viral pneumonia and multiple organs failure.
On April 17, 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus is spread mainly by close contact, often by sweeteners produced by touching, perpetual or speaking.
These sweeteners are produced at the ventilator, usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infective risk on long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days following the occurrence of symptoms, although the infection is possible prior to the occurrence of symptoms and during subsequent stages of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase in real-time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who feel infected by the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations on the port of the mask by the public generally vary, some authorities recommend their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
People infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, swelling, fatigue, rash.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, confusion, difficulty in walking and face or lips; it is advised to consult a doctor immediately in the presence of these symptoms.
Less often, respiratory symptoms such as chronic fatigue, nasal vomiting or stomach pain may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only a thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organs failure and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but it can go up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within the 11.5 days following infection, reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in the transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggested that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of non-symptomatic people is currently unknown and in the study. The Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1, 166 infections reported on this day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectoration and discharge can both carry important viral loads.
The fact that you speak louder than you normally do.
A study in Singapore revealed that all without protection can design rubber bottles at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally transmitted by air, the National Sciences Academy suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors who were exposed to color outside the patient's rooms produced positive samples to the viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary induction and reanimation (RCP) may disseminating respiratory secretions and thus cause air dispersion.
Although there are concerns about a spread by cells, this risk is understood to be low. The virus is most contagious when people experience symptoms; although propaganda may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not known exactly how easily the disease spreads, a person is generally infected with two to three others.
In particular, the virus has been detected for one day on the carton, three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and the stainless steel (ISI 304) and for four hours on the kitchen at 99%.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and solvents are also effective if used properly; the soap-based products weaken the protective lipid layer of the virus, which makes it inactive and removes skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salve samples were taken in mid-day after hospitalization.
In five patients in six, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to Wuhan’s acute respiratory disease.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronaviruses that appear in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by the domestic soap, which breaks its protective package. SARS-CoV-2 is a close parent of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by the COVID-19 because the virus reaches host cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme which is the most prevalent in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicule" (peplomer) to connect to ACE 2 and penetrate into the host cell.
Acute heart attacks have been reported in 12% of those admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is most severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and problems of the immune system during the progression of the disease, however, acute myocardial lesions may also be associated with ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ECE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) have been observed in patients with intensive care with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with adverse forecasts.
While SARS-COV-2 presents a trophism for epithelial cells of respiratory pathways expressing ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 experience systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
These are particularly secretive T cells of GM-CSF which have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and the severe pulmonary pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported to autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the inverse encryption of the chain reaction by polymerase in real-time (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngated removal; however, a nasal or speculatory removal may also be used.
The results are generally available within a few hours, i.e. up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but they require two blood samples taken for two weeks of interval and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a coronavirus strain and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independently of chain polymerisation response (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
On April 4, 2020, anti-corporate tests (achievable to detect active infections and prior infection of a person) were ongoing, but not widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed a precision of only 60 to 70 %.
The U.S. FDA approved the first patient test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month. The diagnostic guidelines published by zhongnan University Hospital in Wuhan suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Occasions in glass multi-lobber bilateral depletion with peripheral, asymmetric and postoperative distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Plenary Dominance, crazi paving (interlobular seven-existence with variable alveolarium) and consolidation can occur with the progression of the disease.
No data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: Plumure, pericaditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytal hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and multinucleed gene cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffusive alveolary damage (DAD) with effluents of diffusion.
DAD is caused by acute respiratory depression syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoglycaemia.
healing pneumonia: organisation of exudes in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation dissemined (CIVD); lyco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding cold places, often washing hands in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a mouse when it is pushed or uninterrupted and using the inside of the chest in the absence of a mouse.
A proper hand hygiene after touching or touching is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with a tissue in public places, in order to limit transmission in case of symptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact with people infected with large groups by shutting down schools and workplaces, reducing displacements and canceling important groups of people.
The distance directives also include respect for a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known medicine to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine has not been expected before 2021 at the latest, a key element in the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemitic peak, which is also called "placing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in toilets or when the hands are obviously salted; before eating; and after being moved, touched, or destroyed.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for trade hands are not available, WHO offers two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, which is “not an antiseptic active substance for hands”.
Glycerol is added as moisture.
People are treated with support services that may include hydrotherapy, oxygen therapy, and support from other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that persons suspected of being carrying a virus carry a simple facial mask.
The extra body oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure cases, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a way of life and healthy nutrition have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those who have moderate symptoms at the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized people for COVID-19.
Reanimative and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
As regards symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetamineopene) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Warnings should be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, particularly in the care conditions where procedures can generate aerosols, such as induction or manual ventilation.
For health professionals suffering from COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an insulation room adapted to air infection (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air-transmission precautions. The CDC highlights the instructions for the use of individual protection equipment (IPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, the respiratory masks are privileged (with facial masks).
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA authorised the use of these masks under an emergency authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unreported uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens or, in the last resort, artificial masks.
The majority of cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are east.
The type of respiratory assistance for people suffering from respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalised people. Some evidence indicates that incubation can be avoided by using a high-deputed nasal channel or a positive pressure of double-level respiratory pathways.
It is ignored whether one or both earns the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to hold invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the distribution of aerosol particles relative to a high-duration nasal channel. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per person, which limits the capacity of the care system to treat a small Sudanese number of cases of COVID-19 sufficiently severe to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% were killed.
In China, about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory depression syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices that offer high pressure control modes and a high PEP are necessary to optimise oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumonia.
The high PEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The research on potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are the subject of clinical trials.
It seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may not be developed before 2021, several test drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tried in people suffering from severe illness.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in potential treatment efficacy and safety tests, and the FDA granted temporary authorisation to plasma of convalescent persons as experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is capable of detecting "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self-care, it also alerts local health authorities. Mass data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile telephone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected persons and those with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data from persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at ensuring respect for the quarantine and protection of persons who might have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared added phone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed the face-to-face recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, Regional Minister for Health Giulia Gallera has been informed by mobile telephone operators that “40 per cent of people continue to move.”
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, displacement restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying that "an increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect stumbling block for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a moderate evolution with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as rhumma.
The moderate cases are generally re-assessed in two weeks, whereas severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Incentive women may pose a higher risk of serious infection to COVID-19 according to similar virus-related data such as SRAS and MERS, but there is no data available for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can quickly progress to develop into an acute respiratory depression syndrome (SDRA) resulting in respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, problems of coagulation and heart, kidney and liver injury.
Coagulation problems, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of cases treated with COVID-19, and renal failure has been observed in 4% of the population.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of COVID-19 people have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, five in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average period of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the mean duration between the beginning of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total of between six and 41 days.
In a study of the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men presented a mortality rate of 2.8% while women presented a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem pulmonary samples present a widespread alveolary damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The picture of the lung resembles an acute respiratory depression syndrome (SDRA).
Of the 11.8 per cent deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart attacks due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest have been observed.
According to U.S. Mars data, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had preexisting pathologies, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region could also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The under-declaration of moderate cases may lead to overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previous contracts may indicate that the current rate of death is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more prone to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are at a higher risk of more than 2.4 times more intensive care or loss in relation to non-smokers. Concerns are also seen in relation to long-term cycles of the disease.
The hospital administration of Hong Kong has observed a 20 per cent reduction in respiratory capacity in some patients, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic injuries.
This can also lead to a post-intensive after-treatment syndrome.
In March 2020, it would be ignored if an earlier infection had a long-term immunity in patients treated with the disease.
Immunity is considered likely to be based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of COVID-19 treated people followed by positive tests of coronavirus at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of infection was almost exclusively carried out by a human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 revealed that the earliest occurrence date of symptoms was repeated on 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first appearance of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and in time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time taken from the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health.
By the end of 2019, WHO had affected the pathological emergency codes CIM-10 U07.1 for the deaths confirmed in the infection laboratory in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for the deaths of COVID-19 diagnosed with a clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection in the laboratory. The death/cas report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the worldwide death/gas report is 6.9% (153 82/22/2 240 191) until 17 April 2020.
This number varies from region to region. Other measures include the rate of mortality (CFR) which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed who suffer from the disease and the rate of infectious leity (IRF) who reflect the percentage of people who are infected (diagnostics or not) who have a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and are followed by a specific population of infection at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, triggering a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths associated with COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been broken down.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people can have antibodies, according to a blood donors assessment.
69 deaths (0,004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics and mortality rates are different in men and women.
Death is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk among 50 men, the difference between men and women who only disappear at 90 years of age.
In China, the rate of death was 2.8% in men and 1.7% in women.
The specific reasons for this difference between sex are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors could be involved.
The immunological differences in sex, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidity such as hypertension to a less advanced age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected individuals were men and 72 per cent of the COVID-19 people were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. Government does not collect the data associated with COVID-19 infection.
Studies have shown that such viral diseases as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, particularly nurses, are women and pose a higher risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
The Director-General of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means dysesia, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of persons, in accordance with the international designation recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by the COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as "coronavirus" and "coron virus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in the names of diseases and viruses.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the limitations on the capacity of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are deprived of care materials such as ecuvellons and respiratory components.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respiratory valve and the supplier could not provide it at any time, a local start was delayed and printed the 100 valves required at night.
Following the initial COVID-19 epidemic, the theory of completeism, false information and disinformation arose about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and were rapidly disseminated online.
It seems that man is able to spread disease to certain other animals.
Studies have not been able to find viral replication evidence in pigs, canards and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, university groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "SOLIDARITY trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds presenting the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use both ACE 2 receptors to paint in human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are the subject of research.
First, researchers are trying to create a vaccine for all viruses.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at triggering a rapid immune response from the human body in the event of a new infection at COVID-19.
A second strategy, the subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to some sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies focus on S-protein-to-speech, which helps the virus to filter into the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of vaccines based on nuclear acids (a vaccine by DNA or ARN, a new vaccination technique).
Experimental vaccines above all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an indefensive genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. The dependent activity of the antibodies has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing.
Seven studies have evaluated previously approved treatment against paludism, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The revised antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine clinical trials of phase III on breast-feeding in several countries where reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of vaccine candidates and drugs against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including manmedesivir, chlorocine and hydrochloricin, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of remdésivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with compassion-based condensation.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan’s virology institute, while recommending a daily dose of a gram, indicates that the double dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency authorisation for medical prescription for COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin or imofenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inject SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for the follow-up of an in vivo study following a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein starting with serum transmbrainated protease 2 (TMPRSSS2) is essential for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ECE 2 receptors.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin show major limitations that prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without additional studies. Ostelamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not play a prominent role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock can be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic anti-choc properties. Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines for the treatment of the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
There is a phase 2 test not performed at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people who have a severe form of disease.
In addition to a serum ferritin blood test to identify the cytokinic shock, such evolutions must be suspected of being the origin of the death of certain affected individuals.
Interleukine-6 receptor antagonist has been approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of refractory cytokines to steroids caused by a different cause, treatment by CAR T cells, in 2017.
To date, there is no established and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies is produced by the immune systems of people with COVID-19 healings to those who need it is in the study as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SRAS with little final results.
Viral neutralisation is the mode of action expected by which passive anticorps treatment can generate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as the cytotoxicity of antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other types of passive antibiotics, such as monoclonal antibodies produced, are under development.
Serum production of convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of patients treated with specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, then contracted COVID-19 and died after paying attention to the spread of the virus.
