Tom knows how Jewish he is.
And I'm glad to be with you.
The pure mathematics on it, in its own way, the poetry of your logical idea.
Did you find anything in the station?
And I didn't throw a truck in Tanna, and she had a motorbike car that I had.
Tom would like to know who he is.
And you think it's the door.

Tom sounds great when he's out of the library.
He's got his grandmother.
I have two children and a son.
And you know I'm afraid.

Shut up.
Let me see.
It's a little bit for Tom for my cup of tea.
Did you find anything in the station?

The preferred place to store the previous project.
And my mom's already met before?
That's what I'm saying.
Tom won it.
It's easy to get into the river.
I think I'm old.

Bat Tom.
Chiel's always got the first word.
So he opened the door.
My son's in New York, and my daughter's in London.
Congratulations!
It could've been rman's and for the night, but the morning you didn't have to hear it.

Good-bye.
She knew she was talking to the English-born motorbike.
I don't like you singing Maria.
And I think you should have returned to Boston.
That's why he's gonna kill him.
Ambrassed Tom.
It's nice to be able to believe in saving Tom's ass, but I can't believe in praying to him.
Chila, among others, did nothing at all.
Do you have the family, Tom?
I'm gonna call you, okay?
It's not easy.
What did you find?
How many times has it been left?
Shut up!
And he's got a friend of Spain who spoke a little bit of a language.
